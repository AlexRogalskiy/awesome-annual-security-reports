DEVSECOPSSponsored by:2IntroductionToday, DevOps teams are embracing newapproaches of embedding application securitytesting (AST) into their development pipelines totruly achieve DevSecOps. Developer and securityteams agree that a single vulnerability scan latein the software development life cycle (SDLC)is insufficient, can result in delayed softwarereleases, and often becomes unnecessarilyexpensive. As with any type of security testing,discovering vulnerabilities late in the pipelinemeans it takes more time and effort to remediatethem. Hence, its highly desirable to shift AST asfar left as possible by integrating security into thetooling developers use.However, DevSecOps is still in its early stages, asevidenced by our 2021 survey, which indicates thatthe security portion of DevSecOps is maturing inpieces. Part of the problem is budget, and partof it has to do with a talent shortage. Smallercompanies especially lack the security expertiseand tools larger companies have.Some of the key findings from our 2021survey are:Half of respondents plan to add moreapplication security staff in the next year.43% say their biggest frustration is securitytesting done late in the SDLC because itdelays launches.Of all the application security types, APItesting is the most popular among two\-thirdsof respondents.Two\-thirds lack a security champion.2021 State of DevSecOpsMethodology3This report is based on a global online survey of applicationAPAC and the Americas.

Sixty percent are located in EMEA, followed byHow big is your application security team?There are always far fewer application security teammembers than developers. Developers outnumber securityprofessionals 100 to 1 in large organizations. More than half ofrespondents (53%) said they employ one to five applicationsecurity team members, and generally speaking, the lowernumber is generally associated with small and mediumbusinesses (SMBs).However, typically, as the number of application securityteam members rise, so does the size of the organization.The number of companies employing 21 or more suchprofessionals outnumbers those that employ 11 to 20\.17%7%23%1\-56\-1053%11\-2021\+Do you plan on adding additional staff to your application security team within the next year?50%38%12%No more additional staff planned1\-5 more5\-10 moreHalf of respondents plan to add more security staff, withthe majority (38%) adding just one to five more.
