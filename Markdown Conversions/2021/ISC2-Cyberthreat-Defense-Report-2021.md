Other surveys do a greatjob of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breachesand exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other badactors. Our mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of ITsecurity professionals.Now in its eighth year, the CDR has become a staple among ITsecurity leaders and practitioners by helping them gauge theirSURVEY DEMOGRAPHICSResponses received from 1,200 qualified IT 
security decision makers and practitionersAll from organizations with more than 500employeesRepresenting 17 countries across North America,internal practices and security investments against those of theircounterparts across multiple countries and industries. If you wantEurope, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin 
America, and Africato know what your peers in IT security are thinking and doing,this is the place to look.CyberEdge would like to thank our Silver, Gold, and Platinumresearch sponsors, whose continued support is essential to thesuccess of this report.Top Five Insights for 2021As always, our latest CDR installment yields dozens of actionable 
insights. But the following are the top five takeaways from this 
years report:1\.Successful cyberattacks make the biggest jump in six 
years.When CyberEdge launched the first CDR in 2014, 62% of 
organizations were compromised by successful cyberattacks. 
That number has risen to 86%. The percentage of organizations 
experiencing a successful attack rose 5\.5% this year, the largest 
increase in six years. We believe this surge is due in large part 
to the dramatic rise in BYOD policy adoptions and a massive 
increase in third\-party risks.2\.Rewarding ransom payers is good for business (if you 
are a cybercriminal). For the first time, more than two\-thirds 
of organizations (69%) were victimized by ransomware. The 
percentage of ransom\-paying organizations that recover their 
compromised data has increased steadily in recent years, from 
49% in 2018 to 72% in 2021\. Cybercriminals have learned 
that withholding data following payment receipt is bad for 
business. Unfortunately, this trend has enticed most victims 
to pay ransoms (57% in 2021\), which in turn has funded moreRepresenting 19 industriesransomware attacks, resulting in more organizations being 
compromised by ransomware than ever before.3\.Adoption of cloud security solutions is rising.The 
COVID\-19 pandemic has sparked more interest in cloud\-based IT 
security solutions than ever before. A year ago, 36% of security 
applications and services were delivered via the cloud. This year, 
that number has risen to 41%.4\. 
IT security spending increases are slowing. For the first 
time since we began tracking this statistic four years ago, the 
percentage of a typical IT budget spent on security has remained 
flat (at 13%) rather than rising. And for the first time in our 
eight\-year CDR history, the percentage of organizations with 
rising security budgets has fallen (from 85% to 78%) and the 
average security budget increase has also declined (from \+5% to 
\+4%). So, overall IT security spending is still rising, but at a slower 
pace than usual.5\.Pessimism is the new normal.Eight years ago, 38% of 
CDR respondents felt that it was more likely than not that their 
company would be compromised by a successful cyberattack 
in the coming year. Sadly, eight years later, that number has 
doubled to 76%. IT security professionals are no longer just 
measured on their abilities to prevent cyberattacks from 
happening, but also their abilities to detect, terminate, and 
remediate from in\-progress attacks.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report3Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupIntroductionAbout This ReportThe CDR is the most geographically comprehensive, vendor\-
agnostic study of IT security decision makers and practitioners. 
Rather than compiling cyberthreat statistics and assessing 
the damage caused by data breaches, the CDR surveys the 
perceptions of IT security professionals, gaining insights into how 
they see the world.Specifically, the CDR examines:vThe frequency of successful cyberattacks in the prior year and 
optimism (or pessimism) about preventing further attacks in 
the coming yearvThe perceived impact of cyberthreats and the challengesfaced in mitigating their risksvThe adequacy of organizations security postures and theirinternal security practicesvThe organizational factors that present the most significant 
barriers to establishing effective cyberthreat defensesvThe investments in security technologies already made andthose planned for the coming yearvThe health of IT security budgets and the portion of theoverall IT budget they consumeBy revealing these details, we help IT security decision makers 
and practitioners gain a better understanding of how their 
perceptions, concerns, priorities, and defenses stack up against 
those of their peers around the world. IT security teams can 
use the data, analyses, and findings to shape answers to many 
important questions, such as:vAre we on track with our approach and progress inaddressing traditional areas of concern, while also tackling 
the challenges of emerging threats?vHow does our level of spending on IT security compare tothat of other organizations?vDo other IT security practitioners think differently aboutcyberthreats and their defenses, and should we adjust our 
perspective and plans to account for these differences?Another important objective of the CDR is to provide developers 
of IT security technologies and services with information they 
can use to better align their solutions with the concerns and 
requirements of potential customers. Our data can lead to better 
market traction and success for solution providers, along with 
better cyberthreat protection technologies for all the intrepid 
defenders out there.The findings of the CDR are divided into four sections:Section 1: Current Security PostureOur journey into the world of cyberthreat defenses begins 
with respondents assessments of the effectiveness of their 
organizations investments and strategies relative to the 
prevailing threat landscape. They report on the frequency of 
successful cyberattacks, judge their organizations security 
posture in specific IT domains and security functions, and provide 
details on the IT security skills shortage. The data will help readers 
begin to assess:vWhether, to what extent, and how urgently changes areneeded in their own organizationvSpecific countermeasures they should add to supplementvWhere do we have gaps in our cyberthreat defenses relativeexisting defensesto other organizations?vHave we fallen behind in our defensive strategy to the pointthat our organization is now the low\-hanging fruit (i.e likely 
to be targeted more often due to its relative weaknesses)?2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report4Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupIntroductionSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsNavigating This ReportWe encourage you to read this report from cover to cover, as its

email at research@cyber\-edge.com.In this section, our exploration of cyberthreat defenses shifts 
from establishing baseline security postures to determining the 
types of cyberthreats and obstacles to security that most concern 
todays organizations. The survey respondents weigh in on the 
most alarming cyberthreats, barriers to establishing effective 
defenses, and high\-profile issues such as ransomware and cloud 
security. These appraisals will help readers think about how their 
own organizations can best improve cyberthreat defenses going 
forward.Section 3: Current and Future InvestmentsOrganizations can ill afford to stand still when it comes to 
maintaining effective cyberthreat defenses. IT security teams 
must keep pace with changes occurring in business, technology, 
and threat landscapes. This section of the survey provides data 
on the direction of IT security budgets, and on current and 
planned investments in network security, endpoint security, 
application and data security, security management and 
operations, and identity and access management. Readers will be 
able to compare their organizations investment decisions against 
the broad sample and get a sense of what hot technologies 
their peers are deploying.Section 4: Practices and StrategiesMitigating todays cyberthreat risks takes more than investing 
in the right technologies. You must ensure those technologies 
are deployed optimally, configured correctly, and monitored 
adequately to give your organization a fighting chance to avoid 
being a front\-page news story. In the final section of the survey 
our respondents provide information on how they are deploying 
and using leading\-edge technologies and services such as 
security analytics and IT security delivered from the cloud. We 
also look at how IT security training and professional certification 
can help enterprises address the serious shortfall in skilled IT 
security staff.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report5Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupResearch HighlightsCurrent Security Posture
vMost successful attacks in six years. The percentage of 
organizations compromised by successful attacks rose by 
5\.5% the largest annual increase in six years (page 7\)!vDeepening pessimism. For the first time, three\-quarters(76%) of security professionals believe a successful attack is 
imminent up from 38% seven years ago (page 9\).vThe weakest link: mobile devices. Following a rise in WFHand BYOD policy adoptions, mobile devices are rated as most 
challenging to secure (page 11\).vShedding light on third\-party risks. A new entrant in this 
years CDR, third\-party risk management (TPRM), is deemed 
the most challenging IT security function (page 13\).vFeeling overwhelmed. The vast majority (87%) of organi\-
zations are experiencing an IT security skills shortfall, and it 
has worsened during the pandemic (page 15\).Perceptions and Concerns
vCyberthreat migraines. Malware, ransomware, and spear 
phishing continue to cause the most headaches; zero\-day 
attacks not as much (page 17\).vWeb and mobile attacks. Nine out of 10 organizations(91%) have been affected by cyberattacks targeting web and 
mobile applications (page 19\).vFueling ransomware. More than two\-thirds of organizations 
(69%) were victimized by ransomware and most (57%) paid 
the ransom (page 21\).vSecurity awareness gap. For the second consecutive year,the number one barrier to IT securitys success is low security 
awareness among employees (page 24\).vUnified app and data security.Simplified securitymonitoring is the top benefit achieved by integrating applica\- 
tion and data security to the same platform (page 26\).vCybersecurity career boosts. Nearly all (99%) respondents 
agree that achieving a specialized cybersecurity certification 
would benefit their career (page 27\).Current and Future Investments
vSecurity spending plateau? The percentage of a typical IT 
budget spent on security remained flat (12\.7%) for the first 
time in three years (page 29\).vSlowing security spending. For the first time in CDR history, 
the percentage of organizations with rising security budgets 
has declined (from 85% to 78%) and the average security 
budget increase has declined (from \+5% to \+4%) (page 31\).vPandemic\-fueled spending reprioritization. The COVID\-19 
pandemic forced around seven out of eight (86%) organizations 
to reprioritize IT security spending (page 33\).vNetwork securitys top picks. NGFWs, DoSDDoSprevention, and deception are the top network security 
technologies planned for acquisition in 2021 (page 35\).vEndpoint security shopping list. Deception and browserisolation are the endpoint security technologies most sought 
after this year (page 37\).vThe stars of appdata security. API gateways and WAFsremain supreme, while bot management and FIMFAM are 
on many shopping lists for 2021 (page 39\).vTIPs tipping the scale again. Threat intelligence platforms(TIPs) are atop the list of security management and 
operations technologies planned for acquisition (page 41\).vBiometrics still red hot. Biometrics tops the list of identity 
and access management (IAM) technologies planned for 
acquisition this year (page 43\).vDemand for MLAI holds strong. Once again, 85% ofrespondents prefer security products that feature machine 
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) (page 45\).Practices and Strategies
vSecurity is going cloud. 41% of security applications aredelivered via the cloud, up from 36% last year (page 47\).vReaping the benefits of DevSecOps. More than nineout of 10 organizations (93%) are realizing the benefits of 
DevSecOps (page 49\).vDecryption challenges. Nearly nine in 10 organizations(88%) are facing challenges with decrypting SSLTLS traffic 
for cyberthreat inspection (page 51\).vEmbracing emerging technologies. Most organizations 
have embraced emerging security technologies: SD\-WAN 
(82%), zero trust (75%), and SASE (74%) (page 53\).2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report6Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security PosturePast Frequency of Successful CyberattacksHow many times do you estimate that your organizations global network has been compromised by a

successful attack (see Figure 3\).Geographically, Colombia claimed the top spot this year for the 
most organizations experiencing a successful attack (93\.9%). 
Down the list, China (91\.5%), Germany (91\.5%), Mexico (90\.6%), 
Spain (89\.8%), and the United States (89\.7%) were a bit above 
average. Countries that fared the best included the United 
Kingdom (71\.1%), Japan (80\.9%), Australia (81\.6%), and Turkey 
(82\.0%) (see Figure 4\).This year, we saw the largestannual increase in successful attackswithin the last six years.Figure 2: Percentage of organizations compromised by at least one
successful attack.Figure 1: Frequency of successful cyberattacks in the last 12 months.The last year has been enormously challenging, both personally 
and professionally, on so many levels. When the world was 
turned upside down by the COVID\-19 pandemic, cybercriminals 
exploited the situation in many ways. Phishing campaigns, 
deceptive domains, and malicious apps are just a few of the 
tactics these crooks employed to convert pain into profit.In last years CDR, we saw a small uptick in successful cyber\-
attacks as we crossed the 80% threshold for the first time in our 
reports history. This year, we saw the largest annual increase in 
successful attacks within the last six years. Just over 86% of our 
responding organizations experienced at least one successful 
cyberattack within the preceding 12 months, with about four in 
10 organizations experiencing six incidents or more (see Figures 
1 and 2\).Of the seven major industries surveyed for this report, education 
was the hardest hit with 92\.3% of organizations reporting a 
successful attack, followed by manufacturing (90\.3%), telecom 
and technology (87\.4%), and finance (85\.5%). Next came 
healthcare (84\.6%) and retail (81\.7%). The bright spot this year2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report7Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security PostureAside from COVID\-19\-specific threats, what other trends caused 
such a big jump in successful cyberattacks? Were glad you asked. 
Last year, CyberEdge conducted a multi\-sponsor research study 
titled, The Impact of COVID\-19 on Enterprise IT Security Teams 
(see page 55 for more information).We surveyed 600 enterprise IT security professionals from seven 
major countries. Key revelations included:v114% increase in remote workersv59% increase in BYOD adoptionsv73% observed increased third\-party risksWith the majority of IT security organizations already under\-
staffed before any of us knew what a coronavirus was, having 
to support so many additional remote workers, many of whom 
were (and perhaps still are) using unmanaged devices, caused 
organizations collective attack surfaces to increase exponentially 
almost overnight. Frankly, were fortunate that we didnt see 
more than a 5\.5% increase in victimized organizations.Our hats are off to all of you who worked so tirelessly to defend 
your companys digital assets during such trying times! We 
dedicate this years CDR to you.Figure 3: Percentage compromised by at least one successful attack in the

of the United States, Boston\-area scientists found that the most 
optimistic people live an average of 11\-15% longer than their 
more pessimistic peers. While most view optimism to be a healthy 
trait, were not so sure that mentality bodes well for cybersecurity 
professionals. And our CDR respondents certainly agree.When we first asked the question at the top of this page for 
our 2014 CDR, only 38\.1% felt like a successful cyberattack in 
the coming year was more likely than not. Fast forward to last 
November when our survey was live, and that number nearly 
doubled to 75\.6% (see Figure 5\). Now, considering that 86\.2% 
of organizations were victimized by successful attacks last year, 
75\.6% actually reflects a degree of optimism that the coming 12Figure 6: Percentage indicating compromise is more likely to occur than

professionals have come to realize that its more of a question
of when their organization will be victimized by a data breach 
than if.On an industry basis, the proportion of respondents saying 
a compromise was more likely to occur than not was highest 
in manufacturing (80\.0%), retail (78\.0%), and telecom and 
technology (75\.6%). The most confident respondents
(relatively) were in healthcare (63\.8%) and government (70\.9%) 
(see Figure 6\).Of the 17 countries we surveyed, the majority of respondents 
in each one felt that a successful cyberattack on their employer 
was more likely than not. Respondents in Chinawere the 
most pessimistic, and in fact the percentage there expecting a 
successful attack soared from 63\.3% last year to 90\.0% this year. 
Respondents in Australiaand the United States also turned 
much more pessimistic, with those expecting successful attacks 
rising from 70\.0% to 86\.0% and from 71\.6% to 82\.1%, respec\-
tively. Respondents in Brazil (52\.9%), South Africa (54\.2%), and 
Italy (56\.0%) were the least pessimistic.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report10Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security PostureSecurity Posture by IT DomainOn a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your organizations overall security posture
(ability to defend against cyberthreats) for each of the following IT components:Figure 7: Perceived security posture by IT domain.The IT security component rated most challenging to secure this 
year is mobile devices (see Figure 7\). Thats up from fourth last 
year. The reason for the jump? Two words: COVID and BYOD.Last year, CyberEdge published a multi\-sponsor survey report 
titled, The Impact of COVID\-19 on Enterprise IT Security Teams 
(see page 55\). Upon surveying 600 IT security professionals 
regarding how the pandemic has affected their practices and 
security investments, we learned that the number of organi\-
zations with bring\-your\-own\-device (BYOD) policies jumped 
nearly 60% due to the massive, almost\-overnight increase in 
remote workers. These mobile devices were largely, if not almost 
entirely, unmanaged with few or no security protections.Next in line are Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which in the 
context of business equate to copiers, VoIP phones, building 
automation systems, closed\-circuit TV (CCTV) systems, climate 
control systems, alarm systems, and more. Each of these 
IP\-enabled components has an operating system, an application, 
and the potential for exploitable vulnerabilities.The third type of IT component that causes the most security 
concerns includes industrial control systems (ICS) and SCADA 
devices. These devices are commonly used by manufacturers, 
electric power generators, nuclear power plants, chemical 
manufacturers, oil refineries, and water and wastewater2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report11Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security Posturetreatment facilities. Just like IoT devices, each has an operating 
system and an application with potentially exploitable 
vulnerabilities.On a positive note, servers, websites and web applications, 
and datastores are of lesser concern, most likely because these 
are static assets that can be more easily monitored. Cloud 
applications used to be a significant headache for IT security 
teams. But with modern\-day cloud access security broker (CASB) 
capabilities often baked into next\-generation firewall (NGFW) 
and secure web gateway (SWG) solutions, the shadow IT 
phenomenon has declined significantly as an issue.So, in the grand scheme of things, how do this years overall 
security posture assessments compare to last years? Well, of the 
13 IT components depicted in this survey question, confidence 
has declined in 12\.The IT security component ratedmost challenging to secure this year ismobile devices. Thats up from fourthlast year. The reason for the jump?Two words: COVID and BYOD.The only IT component that respondents are more bullish about 
defending this year is application containers, which rose to \#9 
on the list from \#13 last year. Kudos to those innovative security 
vendors whove launched new solutions to safeguard Docker, 
Kubernetes, and other application container platforms. Our 
proverbial hats are off to you!In case youre wondering, IT components that reflect the greatest 
drop in safeguarding confidence are:vNetwork perimeter DMZ (public web servers) (\-0\.12\)vMobile devices (smartphones, tablets) (\-0\.11\)vInternet of Things (IoT) (\-0\.08\)2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report12Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security PostureAssessing IT Security FunctionsOn a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate the adequacy of your organizations capabilities
in each of the following functional areas of IT security:Figure 8: Perceived adequacy of functional security capabilities.In this question, we presented a list of 11 IT security functions 
and asked respondents to rate the adequacy of their capabilities 
(see Figure 8\). We added three new IT security functions to the 
list this year:vThird\-party risk management (TPRM)vBrand protectionvGovernance, risk and compliance (GRC)Wed sure like to thank our sponsors that play in the TPRM space 
for encouraging us to add it to the list because, as it turns out, 
TPRM is the IT security function rated most challenging this year! 
And it makes sense, given several high\-profile data breaches that 
have stemmed from victims partners, suppliers, and contractors.Companies that suffered breaches included Target (2013\), Home 
Depot (2014\), Capital One (2019\), Quest Diagnostics (2019\), 
Facebook (2019\), Marriott (2020\), and General Electric (2020\). 
And lets not forget about FireEye, Microsoft, VMware, and dozens 
of other companies affected by last years SolarWinds zero\-day 
vulnerability.Attack surface reduction which includes vulnerability 
management, patch management, security configuration 
management, and penetration testing was rated as the 
second\-biggest challenge this year. In our humble opinions, too 
many organizations underinvest in this critically important area. 
If security teams were more efficient at finding and mitigating 
security risks, we wouldnt need to rely as much on next\-gen2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report13Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security Posturethreat detection technologies because so many cyberthreats 
would be rendered harmless if the vulnerabilities they were 
designed to exploit were already patched.The functional area with the greatest decline in confidence over 
the past year was incident investigation and response, which fell 
three places on our list. There are two reasons why we believe 
this is a direct result of the massive, almost\-overnight increases 
in remote workers and BYOD policy adoptions (see page 55\) 
stemming from the COVID\-19 pandemic. First, we already 
know that the sheer volume of cyberthreats increased last year, 
resulting in a record number of successful attacks. This equates to 
an increased volume of incidents to investigate and remediate. 
Second, its far more challenging to investigate employee\-owned, 
unmanaged devices than company\-owned laptops and 
smartphones.Brand protection is a new entrant to our list this year and is 
also the newest IT security function to get on CISOs radar. In 
the context of cybersecurity, it relates to protecting intellectual 
property (IP) of companies and their associated brands against 
counterfeiting, copyright piracy, trademark squatting, patent 
theft, rogue websites, and social media impersonation. As thisWed sure like to thank our sponsors forencouraging us to add TPRM to the list,because it is the IT security function ratedmost challenging this year!security capability is still emerging, it naturally ranks high on the 
list of most\-challenging IT security functions. Thankfully, several 
security vendors have rolled out brand protection solutions that 
help track down and shut down fraudulent activities on the web.From there, the next set of IT security functions are rated 
pretty close together. The security function that IT security 
organizations are most bullish about despite being among 
the hardest to do well is security engineeringarchitecture and 
design. Kudos to all of the security architects out there who are 
helping to make smart investments to keep their organizations 
safe (or as safe as they can be).2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report14Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security PostureThe IT Security Skills ShortageSelect the rolesareas for which your organization is currently experiencing a shortfall of skilled IT security 
personnel. (Select all that apply.)Unfortunately, nearly nine in 10 organizations(87%) experienced a shortfall in IT securitypersonnel last year, which is a new CDR record.Figure 9: Percent of organizations experiencing a shortfall of skilled IT
security personnel.If there was ever a year when we needed plenty of skilled 
IT security personnel, it was 2020 when the tidal wave of 
remote workers and new BYOD policy adoptions occurred. IT 
security teams had to immediately figure out how to more than 
double remote access capacity and secure unmanaged devices 
practically overnight.Unfortunately, nearly nine in 10 organizations (87%) experienced 
a shortfall in IT security personnel last year (see Figure 9\), which 
is a new CDR record and a 2\.2% increase from the previous year. 
Two percentage points dont seem like a lot, but overworked 
security professionals definitely felt the impact of being thrown 
into the fire to contend with the ripple effect of the pandemic 
(i.e more unmanaged devices, larger attack surface, increased 
cyberthreats, and more incidents to investigate).To add insult to injury, many organizations (especially in 
the travel, leisure, and hospitality industries) were forced to 
reduce workforce spending, including IT security staffing. As a 
result, many IT security teams had to contend with furloughs, 
reductions in hours, and layoffs.If we break down the data by role, we see the greatest shortfalls 
in IT security are IT security administrators (40\.4%), who 
are responsible for installing, configuring, monitoring, and 
maintaining IT security infrastructure components. Next are IT 
security analysts, operators, and incident responders (35\.0%). 
These workers are on the front line of monitoring the organi\-
zation for potential data breaches and other attacks. IT security 
architects and engineers were at the top of last years list of job 
shortages; however, this group has fallen to third position this

DevSecOps practices (see page 49\). The most likely reason for 
this seeming contradiction is that many enterprises are training 
application developers and testers to integrate security into their 
jobs, rather than hiring people with DevSecOps titles.Just like last year, IT security skill shortages are felt the hardest 
by organizations with 10,000 to 24,999 employees (91%). 
Organizations with only 1,000 to 4,999 employees (85\.1%) are
not as impacted but still are definitely feeling the pain like 
everyone else.With regard to major industries, telecom and technology (89\.6%), 
retail (87\.4%), and healthcare (87\.3%) are the most affected by 
the shortage. Education (83\.6%) and government (83\.7%) are the 
least affected.Around the world, we found the greatest shortages in Japan 
(whoa 98\.0%), Singapore (93\.9%), and Canada (89\.8%). IT 
security teams in Brazil (76\.5%), China (80\.0%), and the United

cyberthreats targeting your organization.Figure 11: Relative concern for cyberthreats by type.Of the 12 classes of cyberthreats we track each year, concern for 
malware has been atop the list for six straight years (see Figure 
11\). According to the 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations 
Report (DBIR), 17% of the data breaches researched for that 
report involved malware. So, it makes sense that malware, once 
again, achieved the highest 1\-to\-5 rating with a score of 4\.04\.The next two classes of cyberthreats ransomware (3\.99\) and 
phishingspear\-phishing attacks (3\.99\) have appeared in the 
top three for the last four years. This year, they tied for second 
place, closely followed by account takeovercredential abuse 
attacks (3\.98\) and denial of service (DoSDDoS) attacks (3\.98\), 
which tied for fourth place.IT security professionals aremore concerned about cyberthreatsthan ever before.The biggest gainer in this years CDR is advanced persistent 
threats (APTs)targeted attacks (3\.97\), up 0\.10 from last year. The 
next biggest gainer is web application attacks (3\.94\), up 0\.09 
from last year.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report17Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsAt the bottom of the list for the second straight year is zero\-day 
attacks (3\.86\), as it should be, since less than 1% of registered 
vulnerabilities in MITREs CVE database originate as zero\-day 
vulnerabilities in any given year. Plus, security vendors have made 
incredible strides over the years at detecting never\-before\-seen 
cyberthreats without the use of threat signatures. First, it was 
sandboxing and now its ML and AI algorithms to the rescue.As a reminder, respondents completed our survey in November 
2020, about a month before the world learned of the infamous 
SolarWinds zero\-day attacks that wreaked havoc on hundreds of 
commercial and government agencies around the globe. Next 
years CDR survey will be conducted in November 2021\. It will be 
interesting to see whether concern for zero\-day attacks lingers 11 
months after the SolarWinds catastrophe.One class of cyberthreat that we want to keep our eyes on in the 
years ahead is brand reputation attacks (3\.87\). We added this to 
the list last year and it remains in second\-to\-last position. But we 
believe that this low level of concern may be an ignorance is 
bliss phenomenon, as monitoring social media and the web for 
hijacked andor impersonated social media accounts, counterfeit 
goods websites, and fraudulent websites will become more of a 
concern in the cybersecurity community as:vIncidents become more frequent and seriousvMarketing discovers these concerns and asks IT for helpvDigital risk protection (DRP) and brand protection solutionsbecome more prevalentFigure 12: Threat Concern Index, depicting overall concern for
cyberthreats.Finally, with all of the chaos that IT security professionals 
experienced last year stemming from the COVID\-19 pandemic 
(see page 55\), how has overall concern for all classes of cyber\-
threats changed from a year ago? CyberEdges Threat Concern 
Index averages the 1\-to\-5 ratings across all 12 cyberthreat 
classes to produce a single composite rating (see Figure 12\). In 
our 2020 CDR, the Threat Concern Index rating was 3\.89, a new 
record at the time. This year, that record has been broken with a 
rating of 3\.94\. Put another way, IT security professionals are more 
concerned about cyberthreats than ever before.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report18Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsConcern for Web and Mobile AttacksWhich of the following attacks on your web and mobile applications are most concerning?
(Select up to three.)Figure 13: Most\-concerning web and mobile application attacks.Because attacks on web and mobile applications continue to rise, 
we added a new question to this years CDR survey. From the five 
most common types of web and mobile application attacks, we 
asked respondents to select up to three that concern them the 
most. The results are insightful (see Figure 13\).Atop the list, as no surprise to many, is account takeover attacks 
(43\.7%), which commonly use a technique called credential 
stuffing. This is an automated attack that uses breached 
usernamepassword pairs to fraudulently gain access to 
consumer or business user accounts.Our data also confirmed that web an 
 mobile attacks are pervasive. More than nineout of 10 organizations surveyed reported 
being affected by cyberattacks targeting weband mobile applications.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report19Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsHeres how it works:1\.The attacker acquires usernames and passwords from thedark web following a website data breach.2\.The attacker uses automated bots to test the stolencredentials against retail e\-commerce, financial services, and 
social media websites, or alternately against the websites of 
targeted enterprises.3\.Successful logins (usually around 0\.1% to 0\.2% of totallogin attempts) allow the attacker to take over the account 
matching the stolen credentials.4\.The attacker exfiltrates credit card numbers and otherpersonally identifiable information (PII) from a consumers 
account, or leverages a business users credentials to obtain 
privileged access, move laterally through the enterprises 
data center and cloud applications, and steal intellectual 
property, personal information, financial account numbers, 
and other goodies.Next on the list is PII harvesting (39\.7%), which involves 
exploiting security vulnerabilities in JavaScript or other 
third\-party code components. Security flaws in client\-side 
code provide attackers the means of injecting malicious code 
designed to gain access to the user data at the point of entry, 
including PII such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, 
credit card numbers, and more.In third place is malicious browser extensions (37\.6%). These 
are malicious programs posing as third\-party web browser 
extensions linked to popular social media and online shopping 
sites such as Facebook, Rakuten, and Honey. These extensions, 
commonly written in JavaScript, are designed to exfiltrate
information about the user or to download and execute 
malicious code.Rounding out the list are the bottom three:vCardingpayment fraud attacks (35\.3%), where attackers use 
bots to test lists of recently stolen creditdebit card details on 
merchant websitesvDigital skimmingMagecart attacks (29\.6%), where attackers 
inject malicious code into third\-party JavaScript to steal 
credit card datavUnauthorized ad injections (23\.0%), where attackers (oftenthrough malicious browser extensions) inject banner ads that 
replace or overlay original, legitimate ads and redirect users 
to malicious websitesOur data also confirmed that web and mobile attacks are 
pervasive. More than nine out of 10 organizations surveyed
(91%) reported being affected by cyberattacks targeting web

Section 2: Perceptions and ConcernsResponding to RansomwareIf victimized by ransomware in the past 12 months, did your organization pay a ransom 
(using Bitcoins or other anonymous currency) to recover data?Ransomware is unrelenting! The past 12 months saw a record\-
setting number of successful ransomware attacks. According to 
this years CDR research, 68\.5% of organizations were affected by 
one or more successful ransom attacks (see Figure 14\). Thats an 
all\-time high, up from 62\.4% last year.Why the continuing surge in attacks? Here at CyberEdge, we 
think it may be the result of a three interacting trends, illustrated 
in Figure 15\.The first trend is that the percentage of organizations that 
successfully recovered their data following a ransom payment is 
at an all\-time high of 71\.6%, up from 66\.8% a year ago. But this 
is a double\-edged sword. The more confident organizations are 
that they will recover their data upon paying ransoms, the moreFigure 14: Percentage of organizations affected by ransomware.Ransom Payers that

ransomware attacks.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report21Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and Concernslikely theyll be to actually pay the ransoms. That percentage has 
risen over the past two years to the 57% range. Finally, the trend 
of more organizations paying ransoms motivates cybercriminals 
to increase their volume of ransomware attacks, which means 
another surge in the number of ransomware victims. This is a 
vicious cycle that, unfortunately, doesnt seem likely to be broken 
anytime soon.Another trend toward exponentially higher ransom payments 
is elevating ransomware to the status of a bona fide catastrophe 
for many victims. According to research by Coveware, a 
ransomware incident response vendor, average ransomware 
payments increased 1,732% between the first quarter of 2019 
and the third quarter of 2020, from $12,762 to $233,817 (see 
Figure 16\). The average fell unexpectedly in the fourth quarter of 
2020, to $154,108\. Perhaps organizations are saying no more, or 
perhaps they are negotiating more effectively with the cyber\-
criminals. Regardless, while a $12,000 payment two years ago 
was a nuisance, a $154,000 ransom today can be a serious blow 
to small businesses, hospitals, school districts, local government 
agencies, and other small and medium\-sized organizations that 
have recently become the target of choice for ransomware.Other notable findings from this years CDR regarding successful 
ransomware attacks include:vAustralia (79\.6%), the United States (78\.5%), and SaudiArabia (77\.6%) were the countries most affected, while Japan 
(56\.0%), Singapore (57\.1%), and the United Kingdom (57\.9%) 
were least affected (see Figure 17\).vThe most severely affected major industries were telecom 
and technology (75\.4%) and education (72\.7%), while the 
least affected were government (50\.0%) and healthcare 
(59\.4%) (see Figure 18\).vWhen the data is broken down by organization size, those 
with more than 25,000 employees fared the best (56\.9%). 
Organizations with employee numbers ranging from 500 to 
9,999 were about equally affected (range of 68\.6% to 70\.6%).Figure 16: Average ransom payments, by quarter (data source: Coveware 
Quarterly Ransomware Reports).In September of last year, for a brief period, we thought we 
had seen the worlds first death by cyberattack. A woman in 
Dsseldorf, Germany, with a life\-threatening condition had to be 
transported to a hospital in Wuppertal 30 kilometers (19 miles) 
away because the local hospital in Dsseldorf was victimized by a 
ransomware attack. The attack compromised 30 of the hospitals 
servers, which prevented it from processing new patients. 
Unfortunately, that woman died.At first, the media touted the occurrence as the first fatality 
caused by a cyberattack. But two months later, German 
authorities concluded that the delay in transport was not a 
contributing factor in the patients death.Given steady increases in successful attacks in the multi\-billion\-
dollar ransomware industry, many of which affect hospitals, will 
2021 be the first year we witness death by cyberattack?2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report22Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsFigure 17: Percentage of organizations affected by ransomware in the last 12 months, by country.Figure 18: Percentage of organizations affected by ransomware in the last 12 months, by industry.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report23Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsBarriers to Establishing Effective DefensesOn a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being most serious, rate how each of the following inhibit your organization from 
adequately defending itself against cyberthreats.Figure 19: Inhibitors to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses.Each year, we ask respondents to tell us whats inhibiting them 
from adequately defending their organizations against cyber\-
threats. Whats standing in the way of their success? Is it lack of 
budget? Inadequate security defenses?Our two perennial leaders, low security awareness among 
employees and lack of skilled personnel, remain atop the list this 
year (see Figure 19\). They highlight two longstanding problems 
that have plagued security teams for years.First, too many organizations only train employees once when 
they join the company or government agency on how to avoid 
falling victim to cyberattacks. Smart security teams do things 
differently. They provide all employees with ongoing securitySmart security teams are investingin IT security training and certification as botha recruiting and a retention tool.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report24Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge Groupsolutions that work in isolation. The best security solutions share 
intelligence and perform functions with other security solutions, 
even if they are provided by different vendors.On the opposite end of the spectrum is lack of budget. It is once 
again at the bottom of the list despite the fact that, as well later 
learn, security is now consuming a slightly smaller percentage of 
the overall IT budget (see page 29\) and IT security budgets this 
year are not rising as much as in previous years (see page 31\).If you average out all of the 1\-to\-5 ratings from research partici\- 
pants for all 10 of the inhibitors represented in our survey, you 
get a single number. That number is represented in our Security 
Concern Index (see Figure 20\). This is a way for us to gauge how 
stressed IT security professionals are from one year to the next. 
Are things getting worse or are they getting better?Well, this years Security Concern Index is 3\.65, which is an 
all\-time high, up from 3\.53 a year ago. And for the second 
consecutive year, all 10 inhibitor ratings increased year\-over\-year. 
Of course, given all of the personal and professional challenges 
stemming from the COVID\-19 pandemic over the last year, its no 
wonder stress levels are through the roof. Many security team 
members have been asked to do more with fewer resources 
 while at home with screaming kids in the background. Once 
again, our proverbial hats are off to IT security professionals 
everywhere.Section 2: Perceptions and ConcernsFigure 20: Security Concern Index, depicting the average rating of
security inhibitors.awareness training. Also, they employ simulated phishing 
platforms. These send harmless phishing emails to employees 
every month to expose carelessness and educate potential 
victims on the importance of constant vigilance. Both initiatives 
dramatically increase security awareness and reduce risks of 
ransomware and successful data breachesSecond, we previously learned that 87% of organizations 
experienced an IT security skills shortfall last year (see page 15\). 
Smart security teams are investing in IT security training and 
certification as both a recruiting and a retention tool. Also, we 
know that 81% of IT security professionals would like to work 
from home part or all of the time. By relaxing requirements to 
report to the office every day, a sensible work\-from\-home policy 
can improve job satisfaction and make it a little easier to recruit 
the security personnel youre looking for.Third on this years list of inhibitors is poor integrationinterop\-
erability between security solutions, up from the number six 
position last year. This factor is also responsible for this years 
highest rating change (0\.17 increase). Nobody wants security2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report25Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsBenefits of Unified App and Data Security DefensesWhich of the following have been the biggest benefits of leveraging a unified platform for application 
and data security defenses (e.g WAF, DDoS protection, RASP, API security, data risk analytics, database 
security)? (Select up to three.)Figure 21: Benefits achieved by unifying application and data security defenses.If you ran an ice cream parlor, it would be unrealistic (and 
colossally stupid) to source your chocolate ice cream from one 
supplier, your vanilla ice cream from another, and your strawberry 
ice cream from a third. There are enormous efficiencies to be 
gained from sourcing all your ice cream flavors from one supplier.We believe this same concept holds true for application and data 
security defenses. Sure, there are pure play API security vendors, 
and pure play risk analytics vendors, and pure play database 
security vendors. But wouldnt it be great if you could source 
all of your application and data security defenses from a single 
vendor? Our respondents think so.We asked our respondents to select up to three benefits of 
unifying their application and data security defenses within a 
single platform. The results are insightful (see Figure 21\).At the top of the list is simplified security monitoring (50\.0%). 
Security analysts have one pane of glass to stare at instead of 
many. Next is an improved customer support experience (41\.6%), 
which makes perfect sense as security administrators have 
one number to call when they need technical assistance. Third 
is simplified administration and reporting (39\.2%). A unified 
platform means one management interface and one set of 
reports for all application and data security concerns.The three remaining benefits are reduced cost (36\.6%), simplified 
third\-party integration with key security tools like SIEMs (35\.5%), 
and a simpler acquisition process (30\.1%). Its interesting to note 
that no single benefit achieved less than 30%. Our data reinforces 
the notion that smart security teams are selecting one reputable 
vendor that can satisfy all of their application and data security 
needs rather than sourcing solutions from two, three, or more 
niche vendors. The economies of scale are just too compelling.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report26Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsBoosting Careers with Cybersecurity CertificationsBased on your organizations current climate, which of the following types of cybersecurity certifications do 
you believe would be most beneficial to your career path? (Select up to three.)Figure 22: Types of specialty cybersecurity professional certifications deemed most beneficial to IT security career paths.CyberEdge has always been a huge proponent of IT security 
training and certification. Our founder and CEO, Steve Piper, 
has maintained his CISSP certification from (ISC)2 for more than 
a decade. And many of CyberEdges research and marketing 
consultants have earned cybersecurity certifications from (ISC)2 
and other prominent providers. Last year, CyberEdge surveyed 
600 IT security professionals to assess how the pandemic has 
affected their respective security teams (see page 55\). One of the 
valuable lessons we learned is that 78% of those respondentsIt makes perfect sense that cloud securityis the specialty security certification mostsought after today by IT professionals (51\.2%).2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report27Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and Concernsfelt their IT security professional certifications better equipped 
them to meet the cybersecurity challenges they faced during the 
pandemic.So, being proponents of IT security training and certification, 
we asked the 1,200 respondents to this years CDR to select 
up to three of nine cybersecurity certification types that they 
believe would be beneficial to their career paths. Nearly all of our 
respondents (99%) acknowledged that achieving at least one 
cybersecurity certification would help their career (see Figure 22\).It makes perfect sense that cloud security is the specialty security 
certification most sought after today by IT professionals (51\.2%). 
One of the most notable paradigm shifts in the IT security 
industry in recent years is the move from on\-premises appli\-
cations and security packages to cloud\-hosted applications and 
cloud\-native security solutions. In last years COVID\-19 impact 
study, a whopping 75% of respondents said the pandemicaffected their preferences for cloud\-based security solutions. 
Later in this report, well see that the percentage of security 
applications and services delivered via the cloud increased 
substantially from a year ago (see page 47\).The second most sought\-after specialty cybersecurity certifi\-
cation is software security (50\.0%), which relates to another 
paradigm shift in cybersecurity thinking. Eliminating vulnera\-
bilties during coding is an extremely cost\-effective way to reduce 
your attack surface.In third place is security administration (38\.3%), which is partic\-
ularly timely since the IT security role in greatest demand this 
year is IT security administrator (see page 16\). Beyond that, the 
six remaining specialty certifications, while relevant to specific 
job roles and industries, rate between 12\.8% (health care) and 
23\.1% (management).2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report28Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsIT Security Budget AllocationWhat percentage of your employers IT budget is allocated to information security
(e.g products, services, personnel)?Each year we ask our CDR respondents to specify the percentage 
of their employers overall IT budget that is allocated to infor\-
mation security. For the first time since we asked this question, 
four years ago, the percentage of IT budget allocated to security 
has gone down rather than up (see Figure 23\). Globally speaking, 
that percentage is 12\.7%, down from 12\.8% a year ago. Now, 
were only talking about one\-tenth of one percent. But the fact 
that this is our first\-ever decline is noteworthy.We think the explanation for this change lies in the non\-security 
operational costs of supporting so many new remote workers 
created by COVID\-19\. Yes, organizations have increased their 
budgets for IT security (see page 31\), but they are also spending 
more on laptops, network connections, help desk support, andFigure 23: Percentage of IT budget allocated to information security,
by year.Figure 24: Percentage of IT budget allocated to security, by country.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report29Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future Investmentsother costs related to remote work. We dont think the flattening 
of this trend represents less commitment to security, but rather 
a host of unavoidable expenses related to provisioning and 
supporting WFH and BYOD.Of course, the portion of IT budgets consumed by security varies 
by country, by industry, and by organization size. Lets review 
statistics from each of these perspectives.Geographically speaking, organizations from Brazil (15\.0%), 
Colombia (14\.7%), and Saudi Arabia (14\.0%) dedicate the largest 
portions of their respective IT budgets to security, while organi\-
zations from Italy (10\.1%), Singapore (10\.5%), and Germany 
(10\.8%) assign the smallest. The United States, at 13\.7%, is a full 
percentage point higher than the global mean of 12\.7% (see 
Figure 24\).From an industry perspective, education (13\.7%), telecom and 
technology (13\.2%), and finance (12\.8%) are above the global 
mean. Health care (11\.7%), government (11\.8%), manufacturing 
(11\.8%), and retail (12\.6%) are below it (see Figure 25\).Finally, from a size perspective, smaller organizations with 
500\-999 employees (13\.4%) dedicate the largest portion of IT 
budget to security, while mid\-size enterprises with 5,000\-9,999 
employees (12\.2%) and 10,000\-24,999 employees (12\.1%) 
dedicate the smallest (see Figure 26\).For the first time since we askedthis question, the percentage ofIT budget allocated to security hasgone down rather than up.Figure 26: Percentage of IT budget allocated to security, by

South Africa (\+5\.0%), and Mexico (\+4\.8%) arent as adversely 
affected. However, IT security budgets in Spain (\+2\.8%), Canada 
(\+2\.9%), and Germany (\+3\.0%) have been harder hit. In the 
United States, average IT security budgets are rising by 3\.8% this 
year, just under the \+4\.0% global mean (see Figure 29\).Looking at our seven major industries, healthcare (\+4\.8%), 
telecom and technology (\+4\.5%), and government (\+4\.2%) are 
all above the global mean. Retail (\+4\.0%) and finance (\+4\.0\) align 
with the global mean. Education (\+3\.2%) and manufacturing 
(\+3\.9%) are both below the global mean (see Figure 30\).Organization size does not appear to be a major influencer with 
regard to 2021 IT security budget changes. Mid\-size enterprises 
with 5,000\-9,999 employees seem to have the most IT security 
budget growth (\+4\.5%), while the very largest enterprises with 
25,000 or more employees (\+3\.5%) are experiencing the smallest 
IT security budget growth (see Figure 31\).In short, although the growth of IT security budgets has slowed, 
the IT security profession is a great place to be from a job security 
perspective.Figure 28: Mean annual increase in IT security budgets.Figure 27: Percentage of organizations with rising security budgets.Every year for eight consecutive years, CyberEdge has asked IT 
security professionals whether their operating budgets were 
increasing or decreasing in the coming year, and by how much. 
For the first time in our CDR history, weve seen a decline in the 
percentage of organizations whose security budgets are rising 
(see Figure 27\).Furthermore, this is a first\-ever decline in the amount of IT 
security budget increases (see Figure 28\). Over the preceding 
three years, IT security budgets have gone up by 4\.7%, 4\.9%, and 
5\.0%, respectively. This year, the average IT security budget is 
only going up by 4\.0%.Now, before we all hit the panic button, lets put this into 
perspective. First, were still in the midst of a global pandemic. 
Despite the progress that nations have made in distributing 
COVID\-19 vaccines, its not over yet. And some industries (e.g 
hospitality and retail) have been harder hit by the pandemic than 
others (e.g government and utilities). Second, were not saying 
that the average IT security budget has shrunk this year. Quite the 
contrary. In fact, more than three\-quarters (77\.8%) of IT security 
budgets have increased this year. Its just that these budgets, on 
average, arent growing as fast as they have in the past.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report31Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsFigure 29: Mean security budget increase, by country.For the first time in our CDR history,weve seen a decline in the percentageof organizations whose securitybudgets are rising.Figure 30: Mean security budget increase, by industry.Figure 31: Mean security budget increase, by employee count.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report32Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsCOVID\-19 Effects on IT Security Purchase PrioritiesHow has the COVID\-19 pandemic affected your organizations priorities for acquiring new IT security

re\-prioritization was required were more common in finance 
(54\.5%) and manufacturing, while organizations in the 
government (32\.0%) and healthcare (34\.8%) sectors were not
as impacted (see Figure 33\).priorities last year to accommodate a massive increase in remote 
workers, to secure a plethora of unmanaged personal devices, 
and to deal with a massive increase in cyberthreats and other 
security risks. Lets all be grateful that the end of this pandemic is 
near so life can return to at least some semblance of normalcy.From a geographical perspective, organizations in Turkey (68\.0%), 
Mexico (66\.7%), Colombia (60\.6%), and the United States (60\.2%) 
experienced the highest incidence of major changes in spending 
priorities. Organizations in Canada (30\.6%), the United Kingdom 
(31\.6%), and Germany (35\.1%) were not as affected as much.No matter which way you slice it,the vast majority (86\.3%) of IT securityorganizations had to alter theirIT security spending priorities last year.No matter which way you slice it, the vast majority (86\.3%) of

But it can be difficult to decide which of the many choices to 
prioritize. Certainly it would be helpful to know what your peers 
think. What cybersecurity products and services are must\-haves? 
Which are the up\-and\-comers needed to fill gaps and address 
emerging threats? Are some technologies more hype than 
reality?In this section and the four that follow, we enable you to compare 
your organizations current and planned usage of common 
security technologies against those of 1,200 of your peers around 
the globe starting with network security technologies.The first 
column depicts the percentage of responding organizations that 
are currently using each technology in production. The middlecolumn portrays organizations that are planning to acquire the 
technology this year. The last column reflects organizations that 
havent firmed up their plans yet.To make the results easier to absorb, we color\-coded the cells. 
Dark blue highlights technologies that are widely used now or 
are most likely to be deployed soon. Lighter shades indicate 
lower adoption levels and fewer planned acquisitions. The cells 
with the no plans percentages are gray.Lets start by examining which network security technology 
is most widely used these days. In Table 1 we see only one 
dark blue cell, corresponding to advanced malware analysis 
sandboxing (58\.9%), in the top spot for the second consecutive2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report35Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future Investmentsyear. We can remember when sandboxing first emerged 
as an enterprise\-class product, initially within on\-premises, 
purpose\-built appliances. But rapidly, sandboxing became a 
commoditized feature. It was often provided as an inexpensive 
cloud\-based add\-on to next\-generation firewalls (NGFWs), 
secure web gateways (SWGs), and secure email gateways (SEGs). 
Then, of course, the bad guys found ways to evade sandboxing 
analysis by suppressing malicious routines in files until a human 
later triggered them.Thats about the same time when security products featuring ML 
and AI algorithms designed to detect advanced and zero\-day 
threats arrived on the scene. Nowadays, organizations cant 
afford to rely on network security technologies that feature 
signature\-based detection alone. Thats why advanced malware 
analysis boasts the highest combined adoption percentage 
(91\.7%) of organizations that are planning to acquire this 
technology or are already using it in production. This certainly 
augers well, as malware is the number\-one class of cyberthreat 
on the minds of security professionals this year (see page 17\).Shifting gears, lets examine which network security technology 
is at the top of most shopping lists this year. Once again, weve 
got one dark blue cell. This time, its NGFW. Although NGFWs 
have been around for more than a decade, not all organizations 
have realized the benefits of integrating firewall, intrusion 
prevention system (IPS), and application control technologies 
into one unified, single\-pass architecture. One potential political 
concern is firewall admins from network teams feeling they 
might lose administrative control to their security counterparts. 
But that really shouldnt be an issue, especially since modern 
NGFWs provide role\-based access control so network and 
security personnel can maintain control over the NGFW settings 
and data that are most relevant to their respective roles.In second place this year is DoSDDoS prevention technology 
(38\.6%), which also represents the biggest year\-over\-year gainer 
with regard to acquisition plans. It wouldnt surprise us at all if 
demand for DDoS prevention solutions spiked after Amazon 
Web Services was hit by a gigantic DDoS attack in February 2020\.Plus, have you heard about extortion DDoS attacks yet? Its like 
ransomware meets DDoS. Thousands of organizations received 
emails last year from cybercrime syndicates demanding that 
Bitcoin ransoms be paid or else full\-scale DDoS attacks would 
follow. Some demonstrated their capabilities by committing 
pre\-emptive DoS attacks. While most organizations that rejected 
the ransom payment were unaffected, some were victimized by 
multivector DDoS floods, which peaked at around 200 Gbps.It wouldnt surprise us at allif demand for DDoS prevention solutionsspiked after Amazon Web Services was hit by agigantic DDoS attack in February 2020\.In third place is deception technologydistributed honeypots 
(37\.2%). If you havent looked at this technology yet, do yourself a 
favor and check it out. Its a smart and fairly easy way to uncover 
infiltration attempts by detecting would\-be invaders as they 
move laterally across your network or a simulated replica of your 
network. You gain not only valuable intelligence on your cyber\-
adversaries, but also the ability to sever their connections to your 
network mid\-attack.That wraps up this years network security buying intentions. 
Next up is endpoint security (see page 37\).2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report36Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsEndpoint Security Deployment StatusWhich of the following endpoint security technologies are currently in use or planned for acquisition

network security technologies to gain insight into deployment 
status and acquisition plans for endpoint security technologies 
(see Table 2\). As with Table 1, percentages in dark blue 
correspond to a higher frequency of adoption and acquisition 
plans, while those in light blue correspond to a lower frequency.Once again, lets start out by focusing our attention on the 
first column in the table and identify which endpoint security 
technology is most widely used. Likely not a surprise to anyone, 
basic signature\-based anti\-virusanti\-malware (70\.5%) is at 
the top of the list and probably wont budge from that spot 
for many years to come. Although we all know that relying on 
signature\-based defenses alone is an exercise in futility, theydo play a critical role by filtering out all of the easy (i.e known) 
stuff so security solutions with more\-sophisticated capabilities 
arent overwhelmed as they detect more\-advanced threats that 
signature\-based defenses missed.Lets now discuss the endpoint security technology that is most 
sought\-after in 2021: deception technologyhoneypot (41\.3%). 
As we mentioned in the network security section (see page 36\), 
deception technology provides a smart and fairly easy way to 
uncover infiltration attempts by detecting would\-be invaders as 
they move laterally across your network or a replica. Again, you 
not only gain valuable intelligence on your cyberadversaries, 
but also the ability to sever their connections to your network 
mid\-attack.

depicted in this study.increase the quantity of potential traps that cyberattackers may 
fall into, improving the odds of detecting threats early.Close behind deception technologyhoneypot is browser or 
Internet isolationmicro\-virtualization technology (38\.3%). 
Browser isolation technology, in particular, has grown in 
popularity in recent years no doubt sparked by the use of 
so many unmanaged devices during the pandemic. Instead 
of viewing content accessed via the Internet using local appli\-
cations, users open content within applications in the cloud. 
This change is seamless to users, who view the applications 
as if they were running locally. This approach prevents client 
operating systems and applications from being accessed andcompromised by malware. Because browser isolation services are 
cloud\-based, they are a good fit for organizations that want to 
move more security solutions to the cloud. Demand for browser 
isolation technology has increased so much that it boasts the 
biggest change in use gain among all other endpoint security 
technologies depicted in this study.In third place this year is advanced anti\-virusanti\-malware 
technology (36\.1%) equipped with ML, behavior monitoring, 
andor sandboxing mechanisms. This technology complements 
traditional, signature\-based endpoint defenses by detecting 
advanced and zero\-day threats that those defenses miss. 
Sometimes this technology operates as a standalone endpoint 
detection and response (EDR) solution, while at other times it is 
integrated with a full\-fledged endpoint protection platform (EPP) 
offering.Now that weve covered endpoint security technologies most 
in demand this year, lets explore application\- and data\-centric 
security technologies (see page 39\).2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report38Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsApplication and Data Security Deployment StatusWhich of the following application\- and data\-centric security technologies are currently in use or planned

is application and data security (see Table 3\). As usual, 
percentages in dark blue correspond to a higher frequency 
of adoption or acquisition plans, while those in light blue 
correspond to a lower frequency.Our first observation is that API gatewayprotection adoption 
has skyrocketed! It has gone from last place to first placein just four years. In 2018, adoption was at 45\.1%. Today, its 
at 63\.8%. For lack of a more eloquent expression, holy cow! 
Organizations have come to realize the compelling security and 
administrative benefits of this must\-have security technology.Of course, web application firewalls (58\.5%), database firewalls 
(58\.1%), and database encryptiontokenization (56\.6%) 
technologies also fall into the must\-have category when it2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report39Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future Investmentscomes to application and data security. As DevSecOps adoption 
continues to soar (see page 49\), several other technologies on 
this list will gain traction, such as SASTDASTIAST (48\.6%) and 
RASP (48\.2%) testing tools.vDynamic application security testing (DAST), also known as 
black box testing, is designed to discover security vulnera\-
bilities within a running web application after the software 
development life cycle is complete.With regard to whats hot on this years application and data 
security shopping list, a new CDR entrant, bot management, 
takes the top spot (40\.4%). This rising star technology protects 
your websites, mobile applications, and APIs from automated 
attacks, helping to mitigate the risk of data breaches while 
improving operational efficiency. It can help prevent a variety 
of modern cyberthreats, including account takeover attacks, 
carding attacks, and business logic attacks such as inventory 
hoarding and content scraping (see page 19\).Second on this years list is file integrityactivity monitoring (FIM
FAM), an oldie but goodie in the application and data security 
industry. FIM provides an essential layer of defense that helps 
detect illicit activity across critical file systems so security teams 
can shut down attacks before they have a chance to cause 
damage. FAM discovers and monitors sensitive data (e.g credit 
card numbers, Social Security numbers) on servers and can 
provide an early warning upon detecting a potential data breach.In third place this year are the aforementioned SASTDAST
IAST application security testing tools (38\.2%) staples among 
DevSecOps professionals. Although ranked a little lower on this 
years application security wish list, demand for RASP (35\.9%) is 
also growing. If you are unfamiliar with these acronyms, read on:v Static application security testing (SAST), also known aswhite box testing, allows developers to uncover security 
vulnerabilities in application source code early in the software 
development life cycle.vInteractive application security testing (IAST) combineselements of both SAST and DAST approaches by placing an 
agent within the application that performs all of its analysis 
inside the app in real time at any point during the software 
development life cycle.vThe term runtime application self\-protection (RASP) was 
coined by Gartner in 2012\. Its a security technology built 
into the application runtime environment that is capable 
of controlling application execution while detecting and 
preventing attacks in real time.Now that weve delved into whats hot in the application and 
data security space, lets now dive into the world of security 
management and operations technologies (see page 41\).On this years application and data securityshopping list, a new CDR entrant, bot 
management, takes the top spot (40\.4%).2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report40Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsSecurity Management and Operations Deployment StatusWhich of the following security management and operations technologies are currently in use or planned

These 
technologies serve several important purposes, such as reducing 
an organizations attack surface, detecting advanced threats, 
and automating key security operational functions. As usual, 
percentages in dark blue correspond to a higher frequency 
of adoption or acquisition plans, while those in light blue 
correspond to a lower frequency.At the last Gartner Security and Risk Management Conference 
that CyberEdge participated in before COVID\-19 struck, one of 
the speakers presented three strategies for dramatically reducing 
cybersecurity risks patch, patch, and patch. So, its no wonder 
why patch management (56\.7%) has appeared at the top of the 
currently in use column for three years running.Advanced security analytics (56\.1%) equipped with ML andor 
AI threat detection engines jumped from last place in 2019 to 
second place in 2020\. This year, it remains in second place as one 
of the top cyberthreat hunting solutions in the industry, while 
security configuration management (55\.2%) remains a top\-three 
contender for the third consecutive year.Lets now explore the hottest security management and 
operations technologies planned for acquisition this year. At the 
tippy top of the list (sorry had to) for the second consecutive 
year is the threat intelligence platform, or TIP (43\.5%). TIPs 
help automate, streamline, and simplify the entire process of 
researching, aggregating, and organizing threat intelligence 
data. There are multiple use cases for this compelling technology.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report41Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsIn our 2019 CDR, we asked our respondents to identify key 
motivations for deploying TIPs. They were:vTo improve our ability to detect cyberthreats (53\.7%)vTo improve our ability to validate security alerts (52\.9%)vTo improve our ability to prioritize responses to securityalerts (43\.3%)In second position this year is penetration testing (39\.9%), 
which accounts for the highest percentage increase in planned 
adoption this year. Penetration testing, sometimes called pen 
testing or ethical hacking, refers to the process of using hacking 
techniques to probe computer systems for vulnerabilities and 
security misconfigurations that hackers could exploit.Third on the list of hottest security management and operations 
technologies, for the second consecutive year, is full\-packet 
capture and analysis (38\.8%). In our view, this is the microwave 
oven of security tools. Before the microwave oven came along, 
our parents didnt realize how life\-changing this appliance wouldAt the tippy top of the list (sorry had to)for the second consecutive year is the threatintelligence platform, or TIP (43\.5%).be. Similarly, once you start using a full\-packet capture and 
analysis tool, youll soon forget what life was like before it arrived. 
Thats because its such a powerful tool for detecting advanced 
threats, validating security incidents, and assessing the impact of 
a successful cyberattack.That covers the highlights of security management and 
operations technologies. One more category to go identity

we turn to the innovative world of identity and access 
management, or IAM, a staple of every IT security organization. 
As mentioned on more than one occasion (five, actually), 
percentages in dark blue correspond to a higher frequency 
of adoption or acquisition plans, while those in light blue 
correspond to a lower frequency.Leaping to the top of the currently\-in\-use list, from eighth 
place last year to first place this year, is adaptiverisk\-based 
authentication (56\.3%), also known as step\-up authentication. 
Unlike multi\-factor authentication (still widely popular), whichasks users for specific credentials whenever they log in or access 
corporate resources, adaptiverisk\-based authentication asks 
for different credentials depending on the situation. A low\-risk 
requestfrom the users usual device might require a single, 
simple form of authentication, while a high\-risk transaction 
requested from an unusual device in a location new to the user 
might entail additional security questions, a code sent to a 
smartphone or email address, or a biometric signature. Adaptive
risk\-based authentication reduces the friction for users trying to 
get their work done while providing additional security where 
appropriate.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report43Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsNext on the currently\-in\-use list is password management
automated reset (54\.6%), an important component of most 
IAM strategies for saving valuable IT administration cycles 
and improving user experiences. In third position is privileged 
accountaccess management (51\.4%), or PAM, which helps 
organizations prevent insider attacks and unauthorized privilege 
escalation while enforcing principles of least privilege. This is 
particularly important, because outside attackers and malicious 
insiders can wreak havoc if they secure the accounts of privileged 
users like executives and system administrators.Leaping to the top of the currently\-in\-use list, from eighth place last year tofirst place this year, is adaptiverisk\-basedauthentication (56\.3%), also known asstep\-up authentication.Regaining the number\-one spot on IAM shopping lists from two 
years ago is biometrics (40\.1%). Biometric technologiessuch 
as fingerprint readers, facial recognition, iris recognition, hand 
geometry, and voice recognitionprovide highly accurate, 
convenient, and hacker\-proof ways to authenticate user access to 
systems, applications, data, and physical locations.In second place on IAM shopping lists this year is federated 
identity management (37\.4%), which got bumped from 
first place last year. This technology helps enterprises and 
applications share identities so subscribers can use the same 
credentials to access various applications. Its what enables you 
to log into so many websites with your Google or Facebook 
account.In third place this year is single sign\-on (36\.6%), or SSO. SSO has 
been around for years, making it so much easier for workers 
to access disparate systems and applications using one set 
of credentials. SSO is tightly coupled with two\-multi\-factor 
authentication (2FAMFA) technology, providing an additional 
layer of IAM security.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report44Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge Group

For 
the second year, we asked our respondents to gauge their overall 
preference for purchasing security products that feature ML and
or AI technology. And for the second straight year, the sum of 
those who indicated a strong preference (40\.5%) and a moderate 
preference (44\.8%) came to 85\.3%, exactly. Even the industries 
with the most interest (telecom and technology at 90\.2%) and 
least interest (government at 76\.0%) in security products that 
feature ML andor AI were the same as last year (see Figure 35\).

Period. But while ML and AI are often used interchangeably, they 
refer to different things. Lets break it down.vAI is the ability of a system to complete tasks that are usually 
done by humans because they require human intelligence 
and discernment.v ML is a subset of AI and, in the context of cybersecurity, is 
arguably the most common method for achieving AI. ML 
gives systems the ability to learn from experience without 
any explicit programming or expertise. ML relies on special 
algorithms, such as decision trees, neural networks, and 
regression.We benefit from ML in our everyday lives and may not realize it.

solutions. Not only solutions for monitoring security in the cloud 
(i.e IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), but also solutions leveraging the cloud to 
host security tools that monitor for risk everywhere, from cloud 
to core.Before we delve into the results of the survey question referenced 
above, lets recap a few key statistics from last years The ImpactFigure 37: Percentage of

highest adoption rate for cloud\-based security solutions, with 
Brazil (44\.4%), Saudi Arabia (42\.6%), and Australia (42\.4%) not far 
behind. Cloud\-based security solutions just arent as prevalent 
(yet) in Italy (27\.4%), Canada (33\.6%), and Japan (35\.6%) (see 
Figure 38\).From an industry perspective, IT security professionals in 
the healthcare (42\.5%), manufacturing (41\.8%), and finance 
(41\.6%) industries certainly have their heads in the cloud. Their 
counterparts in the education (36\.7%) and government (37\.1%) 
industries, not as much (see Figure 39\).Organization size doesnt seem to be a significant factor, with the 
range varying from 500\-999 employees (45\.9%) to 10,000\-24,999 
employees (37\.4%).Most agree that life may never return to exactly the way it was 
before the COVID\-19 pandemic began. Once the pandemic is 
over and were living in the new normal, many believe that 
organizations will begin to relax restrictions that previously 
prevented employees from working from home, now that 
theyve seen first\-hand that remote workers can still be

more in cloud\-based security solutions a new normal for the 
security industry.Figure 39: Percentage of security applications and services delivered via

completed our survey last August indicated a significant or 
moderately increased preference for cloud\-based security 
solutions versus traditional on\-premises options.vThe top three IT security technologies that were specifically 
selected to address COVID\-19 pandemic challenges were 
cloud\-based SWG, cloud\-based NGFW, and cloud\-based SEG.Noticing a trend here? These days, smart IT security teams are 
turning to cloud\-based security solutions like never before. In our 
2020 CDR, respondents indicated that 35\.7% of their collective 
security applications and services were delivered via the cloud. 
This year, that figure has risen to 40\.6%, which equates to nearly a 
14% increase in just 12 months (see Figure 37\).2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report48Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and StrategiesBenefits of Embracing DevSecOps PracticesWhich of the following have been the biggest benefits of DevSecOps practices for your organization?
(Select up to three.)Figure 40: Most significant benefits of DevSecOps practices.For those who arent familiar with DevSecOps, or simply havent 
jumped on the bandwagon yet, DevSecOps is a profound 
culture shift in the software industry that aims to bake security 
into the rapid\-release cycles. These are typical of modern (agile) 
application development and deployment, also known as 
DevOps. Instead of securing applications after coding is finished, 
organizations shift left by baking security into the application 
development process from the very beginning of the software 
development life cycle (SDLC).We asked our 1,200 respondents about the most notable benefits 
of DevSecOps practices that theyve seen in their respective 
organizations (see Figure 40\). Before we delve into the findings,its worth noting that the benefit at the bottom of the list 
achieved a 38\.3% rating. So, all five of these key benefits are 
compelling.The top two items on the list of DevSecOps benefits are 
tightly coupled around the same topicspeed. Specifically, our 
respondents cited increased speed of deploying application 
updates (47\.2%) and increased speed of deploying new 
applications (45\.8%). Instead of tossing new applications and 
updates to existing applications over the wall to the security 
team to assess and approve, security is built and tested in during 
the development process, saving considerable time and, in many 
instances, accelerating business advantages.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report49Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and StrategiesIf youd like to know more about the tools that DevSecOps 
professionals use to embed security within modern applications, 
turn to page 40 to learn about SAST, DAST, IAST, and RASP.Third on the list of DevSecOps benefits is improving relations 
between DevOps and SecOps personnel (42\.9%). (We can 
visualize many of you shaking your heads as you read this.) 
Historically, tension has existed between DevOps teams and 
SecOps teams because they have widely divergent goals. One 
is focused on application features and functionality, while the 
other is focused on mitigating application cyber risks. This lack 
of cohesion between these two teams is detrimental to their IT 
organizations and the companies they serve.To be clear, DevSecOps is a culture shift. Peter Drucker, widely 
regarded as the founder of modern management, once said, 
Culture eats strategy for breakfast.What he meant is that a 
companys strategy, while by no means unimportant, takes
a back seat to its culture. The same concept holds true
within IT security teams. DevSecOps mandates continuous
communication, transparency, and shared outcomes between 
DevOps and SecOps personnel. Suddenly, security is
everyones responsibility!The top two items on the list ofDevSecOps benefits are tightly coupledaround the same topicspeed.This culture shift drives the next two beneficial outcomes on the 
listreduced costs (38\.5%) and fewer application security risks 
(38\.3%). Theres no question that implementing DevSecOps has a 
positive impact on a companys bottom line. Thus, DevSecOps is 
one of the fastest\-growing segments of the IT security industry. 
So much that were happy to report 93\.0% of our responding 
organizations have already begun to implement DevSecOps 
practices. Of the small group that hasnt, 71\.4% plan to get
started soon.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report50Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and StrategiesSSLTLS Traffic Decryption ChallengesWhich of the following challenges does your organization face with regard to decrypting SSLTLS traffic and 
inspecting it for threats? (Select all that apply.)mean response was 34\.5%. That was shocking to us. With 85% 
or more (industry reports tend to vary between 85%\-95%) of 
web traffic encrypted, only decrypting a third of that traffic 
for inspection creates an enormous blind spot for security 
professionals.So, this year we wanted to understand why more organizations 
arent decrypting web traffic for inspection. Specifically, we asked 
our respondents to select from four key SSLTLS decryption 
challenges. But before we assess the rankings of those 
challenges, wed like to point out a scary statistic from this years 
CDR. Exactly 88% of this years respondents indicated that their 
organizations are, indeed, experiencing challenges decrypting 
SSLTLS web traffic (see Figure 41\). Whats frustrating is that we 
know it doesnt have to be this way. (More on that later.)The number\-one challenge our respondents face with regard 
to decrypting SSLTLS web traffic is the significant decrease in 
performance within network security tools (44\.1%) (see Figure 
42\). We can remember when IPS, NGFW, and SWG vendors 
started to build SSLTLS decryption into their respective products 
about 15 years ago. In some instances, performance decreased 
by 90%. These days, the performance hit on typical network 
security appliances is still significant.Exactly 88% of this years respondentsindicated that their organizations areexperiencing challenges decrypting SSLTLSweb traffic. Whats frustrating is that we know 
it doesnt have to be this way.Figure 41: Percentage of organizations facing SSLTLS traffic 
inspection challenges.WARNING: Please stand back as CyberEdge steps onto the 
proverbial soap box and preaches for a bit.We all have pet peeves. Last year, SurveyMonkey surveyed 544 
ordinary people and asked them to rank their most significant 
pet peeves. The top three were leaving common spaces messy 
(63%), neglecting to take out the trash (45%), and talking loudly 
on the phone (30%). Well, we at CyberEdge have our own pet 
peeves about the security industry, and organizations failing 
to decrypt SSLTLS traffic for inspection by security tools is one 
of them. Its second on our list, if you must know, right behind 
security vendors saying on premise when they really mean on 
premises. But well save that for another day.Last years 2020 CDR provided an eye\-opening statistic on this 
topic. We asked our respondents to estimate the percentage of 
their organizations SSLTLS\-encrypted web traffic that is actually 
being decrypted for inspection by network security tools. The2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report51Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and StrategiesFigure 42: Challenges faced with decrypting SSLTLS traffic for inspection.The second\-biggest challenge pertaining to decrypting SSL
TLS traffic is the potential for violating regulatory requirements, 
such as PCI DSS and HIPAA (42\.9%). If all network traffic is 
decrypted, outside attackers and unauthorized employees have 
more opportunities to read credit card numbers, medical data, 
and other information protected by regulations. To prevent this, 
solutions need application intelligence so they can decrypt 
selectively.The third\-biggest challenge relates to the complexity of network 
architectures (41\.5%), followed by the fact that not all network 
security tools are even capable of SSLTLS decryption (29\.0%).Okay, so why is this subject such a pet peeve for CyberEdge? Its 
because purpose\-built, dedicated SSLTLS inspection appliances 
have been on the market for years and too few organizations are 
taking advantage of them. These appliances decrypt ingress and 
egress SSLTLS traffic and direct it to a closed loop of network 
security tools (e.g firewall, IPS, NGFW, SWG, DLP). After the traffichas been inspected and malicious traffic has been blocked, 
the traffic is re\-encrypted before being forwarded to its final 
destination. Also, decryption can be selectively disabled for traffic 
that contains data protected by regulations.These SSL inspection 
appliances are so powerful that neither throughput nor latency 
of your Internet traffic is adversely impacted.So, what does this mean for IT organizations? It means you 
can have your cake and eat it, too. By using dedicated SSLTLS 
inspection appliances, you avoid performance impacts to your 
existing network security tools, you maintain compliance with 
regulatory standards, you maintain your network architecture, 
and you dont have to worry about security tools that are 
incapable of decrypting web traffic. Given that the majority of 
modern malware uses encryption to conceal command and 
control (C\&C) communications, payload delivery, and data 
exfiltration, how can organizations afford to ignore this problem 
any longer?2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report52Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and StrategiesEmerging IT Security TechnologiesDescribe your organizations deployment plans for each of the following emerging IT security
technologies architectures. Currently in production Implementation in progress Implementation to begin soon No plansFigure 43: Plans for implementing emerging IT security technologies architectures.To wrap up this years CDR findings, lets assess the extent to 
which IT organizations are embracing three emerging security 
technologies: SD\-WAN, ZTNA, and SASE. For each technology, we 
asked our respondents whether it was already in production, if 
implementation was already in progress, if implementation was 
to begin soon, or if they had no plans at all for deployment.Before we assess adoption rates, heres a quick primer on each of 
these three emerging security technologies:vSoftware\-defined networking (SD\-WAN) is the nextgeneration of WANs and an important step in the evolution 
of networking. Instead of using dozens or hundreds of 
individually configured routers over expensive MPLSIf your organization hasnt alreadyembraced any of these technologies,we hope this years CDR will provide theevidence you need to influence change,so your organization doesnt end up at acompetitive disadvantage.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report53Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and Strategiescircuits, SD\-WAN simplifies network policy configuration 
and management while operating over broadband Internet 
connections, resulting in dramatically lower network costs.vZero trust network access (ZTNA) is a security framework that 
reduces network security risks by removing implicit trust and 
enforcing strict user and device authentication throughout 
the network. Unlike VPNs, which grant complete access to a 
LAN following user authentication, ZTNA denies access to all 
corporate resources with the exception of applications and 
systems to which the user has been explicitly granted access.vSecure access service edge (SASE) is a cloud architecture that 
combines SD\-WAN with key network security functions, such 
as firewall as a service (FWaaS), secure web gateways (SWG), 
cloud access security brokers (CASB), isolation, and DLP.A common misconception is that organizations must choose 
between ZTNA and SASE approaches. This couldnt be further 
from the truth. Each solution solves different challenges. And 
most importantly, ZTNA is an important ingredient of a compre\-
hensive SASE architecture.So, with our primer complete, lets explore the results of the 
aforementioned survey question. And well do so in two ways. 
First, Figure 43 illustrates current adoption, with percentages 
that depict organizations that have already deployed each 
technology or are in the process of deploying it now. Here we 
see that 82\.3% of organizations have already embraced SD\-WAN, 
which makes sense since its been around a few years longer. To 
a slightly lesser extent, 74\.5% of responding organizations have 
implemented ZTNA and 74\.1% have adopted SASE.At the end of the day, all three of these emerging technologies 
play important roles in modern security architectures. If your 
organization hasnt already embraced any of these technologies, 
we hope this years CDR will provide the evidence you need 
to influence change, so your organization doesnt end up at a 
competitive disadvantage.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report54Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupCOVID\-19 Pandemic ImpactsThe Impact of COVID\-19 on the IT
Security IndustryThe COVID\-19 pandemic and its shock to world economies 
have profoundly altered work environments and cybersecurity 
priorities. COVID\-19 has prompted a massive work\-from\-home 
(WFH) movement, leading to the skyrocketing use of videocon\-
ferencing, collaboration tools, and cloud\-based applications. 
Networks and remote access infrastructure have come under 
pressure. New threats targeting these technologies and pandemic\- 
related anxieties have emerged. Meanwhile, many IT security 
teams are forced to do more with the same or fewer resources.How has the COVID\-19 pandemic specifically affected IT security 
organizations? How are they rethinking their priorities and 
investments? Well, thanks to research conducted by CyberEdge 
last year (and the generous support of our sponsors), we now 
have the answers.In August 2020, CyberEdge surveyed 600 enterprise IT security 
professionals from seven countries and 19 industries. Our 20 
survey questions were related to the following four topics:vIT security budgets and personnelvWork\-from\-home movementvvIT security challengesTechnology investmentsThis culminating report is titled, The Impact of COVID\-19 on 
Enterprise IT Security Teams. It contains dozens of helpful 
insights. Here are our top five takeaways:1\.The 2020 budget shocker. Just when everyone thought 
that 2020 could finally be the year that IT security budgets 
stalled, we came along and are now dispelling that rumor. 
Our research indicates that the average enterprise IT 
security budget has received a 5% mid\-year boost during 
the pandemic to fund additional remote access capacity, 
to secure personally owned devices accessing company 
applications and data, and to pretty much buy anything and 
everything that begins with the word cloud.2\.Remote workforce tidal wave. Prior to the COVID\-19pandemic, about 24% of an enterprises global workforce was 
working from home on a part\-time or full\-time basis. That 
number has risen to 50%, which equates to a 114% increase 
almost overnight. The implications of this so\-called WFH 
movement are profound and, we believe, will influence the 
new normal for enterprises moving forward.3\.Spike in BYOD adoption. Before the pandemic, about 42% 
of enterprises employed bring\-your\-own\-device (BYOD) 
policies that enable employees to use their home computers, 
smartphones, and tablets to access company applications 
and data. That number has spiked to 66%, equating to a 59% 
increase in a matter of months.4\.Not enough aspirin for these headaches. Every IT security 
team in every enterprise is feeling the effects of this global 
pandemic, including dealing with an increased volume 
of cyberthreats (37%), insufficient remote access and 
VPN capacity (35%), and increased risks stemming from 
unmanaged devices (35%). 73% of our respondents are also 
experiencing increases in third\-party risks.5\.A cloudy forecast. Three out of four (75%) IT securityprofessionals now prefer cloud\-based security solutions to 
traditional on\-premises security solutionsand with good 
reason. This makes perfect sense as the top\-three IT security 
technology investments made specifically to address new 
challenges stemming from the COVID\-19 pandemic begin 
with the c\-word.To download the full report to review all of the research findings,

and Security PrioritiesIn most of our Cyberthreat Defense Reports, The Road Ahead 
section highlights the most critical emerging threats for the 
coming yearadvanced malware, APTs, phishing, DDoS attacks, 
ransomware, etc.and the latest security technologies being 
developed to meet them.In 2021, however, we are obliged to take a different approach 
and focus on how the COVID\-19 pandemic has created new 
security challenges by profoundly altering workplaces. The 
percentage of the global workforce working from home on a 
part\-time or full\-time basis has more than doubled, to roughly 
half of all workers. One direct effect has been a 59% surge in the 
number of enterprises implementing BYOD policies. Work from 
home and BYOD are likely to remain the new normal for most 
organizations.This transformation of the workplace has had a profound effect 
on the goals of security teams. Many of them now must protect 
far more remote and mobile workers than in the past, as well as 
their devices and the data on them. For once, emerging threats 
have been overshadowed by the imperative to upgrade the 
security of remote and mobile workers (while maintaining appli\-
cation performance and controlling network and support costs).Lets look first at how this new imperative is likely to play out for 
security organizations and security vendors in 2021\.Improving security and ease of use for remote workers:
zero trust network accessBalancing security and ease of use for remote workers has always 
been a challenge for IT security organizations. But pre\-COVID, 
the limited number of remote and mobile workers meant that 
getting the balance right was just not a top priority. Today, with 
half of employees working remotely at least part\-time and BYOD 
part of the new normal, security organizations must focus on 
strengthening security for remote workers while making their 
lives easier (or at least not harder).Thats why this year we are looking for a big push toward 
implementing zero trust network access. Zero trust technologies 
aim at enforcing user and device authentication consistently 
across remote and headquarters\-based workers, while tightly 
controlling access to applications and systems in data centers 
and cloud platforms on a need to know basis. Our survey data 
on page 53 shows very strong intent to implement and improve 
zero trust network access, and we expect this to continue to be 
a top priority for security organizations throughout 2021 and 
beyond.Combining security and network management: SASE, 
SD\-WANs, NPBs, and moreThe surge in remote work also has profound implications 
for the interaction between security and networking. In the 
past, enterprises could afford to backhaul all network traffic 
to corporate data centers for inspection and cleaning by 
on\-premises security tools. But with many more remote workers, 
far higher volumes of unpredictable network traffic, and more 
applications hosted in the cloud, that architecture becomes very 
problematic. When applications reside on cloud platforms:vBackhauling large volumes of traffic via VPNs and MPLScircuits is expensive.vRouting traffic through corporate data centers instead ofdirectly to the cloud degrades application performance.vIt is much more difficult to take advantage of the new 
security tools designed to work on cloud platforms.These factors are causing enterprises to examine how managing 
security and networks together can reduce costs, improve 
performance, and strengthen protection for remote workers. 
For example, SASE architectures, along with technologies such 
as SD\-WANs, network packet brokers (NPBs), and secure web 
gateways (SWGs) facilitate secure, direct\-to\-web connections 
for remote workers and branch offices, thereby reducing 
backhauling over VPNs and MPLS connections. They support 
capabilities like routing high\-priority applications over the2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report56Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupThe Road Aheadbest\-performing network links and providing automatic failover 
when a link goes down. They also allow to traffic to be sent 
directly to cloud\-based security solutions that are integrated with 
cloud\-hosted applications.These architectures and technologies were being implemented 
before COVID, but we believe the pandemic has greatly accel\-
erated their adoption.Security applications delivered via the cloudAs we related on page 47, over the past year the percentage of 
information security applications and services delivered via the 
cloud leapt almost 5%, from 35\.7% to 40\.6%. This transition has 
been going on for years but was accelerated by the pandemic. 
The higher the percentage of remote workers in an organization, 
the greater the incentive to connect them directly to cloud\-based 
security solutions rather than backhauling network traffic to data 
centers for inspection by on\-premises security products. We think 
that security organizations, and IT security vendors, will maintain 
a rapid march toward cloud\-based security in 2021 and beyond.New Threats and New (and Improved) 
TechnologiesAlthough the transformation of the workplace wrought by 
COVID\-19 has had the biggest impact on IT security directions, 
we should still note the influence of emerging threats and the 
new and improved technologies being developed to meet them.Unified monitoring across platforms featuring
machine learningWe have discussed for many years the disappearance of the 
hard perimeter for keeping threats out of the enterprise. Over 
time, the emphasis of security teams has evolved toward 
monitoring networks and systems to quickly detect and stop 
malicious activity. Now that task has become more challenging 
because your computing environment may now be spread 
across on\-premises data centers, SaaS applications, and cloud 
platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure,and Google Cloud Platform. Detecting malicious activity requires 
monitoring and correlating tens of thousands of security events 
on all those platforms.How are security vendors responding? First, by creating new 
monitoring tools or extending existing ones to capture security 
events and data across on\-premises, SaaS, and cloud platforms. 
Second, by embedding into their solutions improved ML tools 
that can sift through vast quantities of data to detect patterns 
correlated with attacks and emerging threats. The survey data 
on page 45 confirms the overwhelming preference of organi\-
zations for security products that feature ML or AI. We think this 
preference will continue to feed an ever\-stronger trend toward 
greater use of ML and AI across more\-comprehensive security 
data sets.It is your problem: third\-party risk management and brand 
protectionTraditionally, groups dedicated to third\-party risk management 
(if they existed at all) operated separately from IT security, often 
in purchasing or in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) 
departments. In a similar way, brand protection programs, 
assigned to scan social media and ecommerce sites for scams 
and negative references that could damage an enterprises brand, 
often belonged solely to marketing.But enterprises are worried that these siloed approaches increase 
risk. On page 13 you can see that of 11 security functions, 
respondents are least confident about the adequacy of their 
organizations third\-party risk management (TPRM) capabilities. 
Brand protection is close behind as a major concern.We believe forward\-thinking executives will increasingly realize 
that IT security organizations should share responsibility for 
third\-party risk management and brand protection. Security 
organizations at larger enterprises need to help their suppliers 
and other third parties find vulnerabilities and improve security 
processes. Likewise, the experience and skills of security groups 
are needed to help marketing groups detect brand\-related 
scams, fraud, counterfeit goods, and misleading information on 
websites and social media platforms.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report57Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupThe Road AheadThis trend will offer new job options for IT security team 
members, and will also create new opportunities for GRC, 
threat intelligence, and brand protection vendors to tailor their 
solutions for a more diverse customer base.More innovative technologiesHere are some of the other innovative concepts and technologies 
we see becoming more prominent in 2021 and beyond:v Security automation, orchestration, and response (SOAR) 
solutions will play an increasingly important role in managing 
and integrating security products on highly automated cloud 
platforms.v DevSecOps concepts and products will help ensure that new 
applications are systematically tested for vulnerabilities and 
security policy violations.v Browser isolation technology continues to improve andgain acceptance in large enterprise environments, and we see 
growing adoption ahead.v Continuous security validation technology will helporganizations confront evolving threats and changing attack 
surfaces. Instead of waiting for an attack to test security 
controls, this technology launches simulated attacks across 
an organizations networks and systems, validating that 
controls are performing as expected in production, and 
facilitating incident response exercises and purple teaming 
(a technique where red and blue teams work together to 
challenge and remediate defenses).v Threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) and servicesenable organizations to identify and prioritize indicators of 
compromise (IoCs) and other clues about ongoing attacks 
faster and more accurately. We are seeing improvements in 
these solutions that will widen their applicability, such as the 
ability to correlate open\-source threat data with events on an 
enterprises network and to initiate automatic scans based on 
new threat data. Page 41 shows that 43\.5% of organizations 
plan to implement a threat intelligence platform or service in 
2021, the highest planned for acquisition rate of any single 
technology in our survey.2021 Cyberthreat Defense Report58Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupAppendix 1: Survey DemographicsThis years report is based on
