Cybercriminals are 
targeting and attacking all sectors of critical infrastructure, including healthcare and public health, information 
technology (IT), financial services, and energy sectors. Ransomware attacks are increasingly successful, crippling 
governments and businesses, and the profits from these attacks are soaring.The cybercrime supply chain, often created by criminal syndicates, continues to mature allowing anyone to buy 
the services needed to conduct malicious activity for financial gain or other nefarious purpose. Sophisticated 
cybercriminals are also still working for governments conducting espionage and training in the new battlefield.It is not hopeless, and there are two positive trendswe have seen recently. First, more governmentsand companies are coming forward when they arevictims. This transparency helps in several ways. Ithas made clear to governments around the worldthat cybercrime is a threat to security. Victim storieshumanize and make clear the consequences of theseattacks, drawing attention to the problem and allowingincreased engagement from incident responders andlaw enforcement. Second, now that governmentsaround the world recognize that cybercrime is a threatto national security, they have made combatting it apriority. Governments around the world are passingnew laws regarding reporting, creating cross\-government task forces, allocating resources, andseeking out private sector assistance.The cybercrime 
economy and 
servicesThrough our investigations of online organized crimenetworks, frontline investigations of customer attacks,security and attack research, nation state threattracking, and security tool development, we continueto see the cybercrime supply chain consolidate andmature. It used to be that cybercriminals had todevelop all the technology for their attacks. Today,they rely on a mature supply chain, where specialistscreate cybercrime kits and services that other actorsbuy and incorporate into their campaigns. With theincreased demand for these services, an economy ofspecialized services has surfaced, and threat actorsare increasing automation to drive down their costsand increase scale. For example, we are seeing anincreasing offer of backconnect proxies (proxies thatrotate between mobile, residential, and datacentersystems) in addition to Remote Desktop Protocol(RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), virtual private network(VPN), virtual private server (VPS), web shells, cPanels(webhosting management dashboard), and otheranonymization systems.Other examples include selling compromisedcredentials that may have been obtained fromphishing, scraping botnet logs or other credentialharvesting techniques, imposter domain names,phishing\-as\-a\-service, customized lead generation(for example, victims by country, industry, or roles),WITH NOTECHNICAL

In thisdouble extortion model, a victim is first extorted for ransom and for the possible publishing of their stolendata. Conti is also a ransomware as a service (RaaS), which is a subscription\-based service allowing affiliatesof the service ready access to ransomware\-building tools and builds. Affiliates of the service agree to ransompercentage payouts between the ransomware developer and threat actor who performed the exploitation. Contiusually gains access to the victim network via other threats like Trickbot, IcedID, or Zloader. Once inside thevictim network, Conti has a configurable reconnaissance module where it can scan internal networks lookingfor network shares and other high\-value targets. Once deployed, Conti begins to encrypt user\-modifiable dataand databases based on targeted file extension lists. Upon completion of the encryption, a ransom note is left inevery file directory with instructions for the user on how to contact the ransomware actors:Ransom noteImportant details to be aware of when making thedecision whether to pay ransoms:Paying a ransom fuels the ransomware

Governmentsacross the globe are instituting ransomwarepayment reporting requirements, may havepenalties for payments that are made tosanctioned parties, and are considering lawsthat could make ransom payments illegal.Paying a ransom gives the criminals more

The most important of these steps is the use of multifactor authentication (MFA),which is important to raising friction for entry but will take time to complete as part of a larger security journey.Other steps, such as keeping up to date on patching and correct configuration, can be taken to identify andclose off vulnerable entry points.8 Ransomware Playbook \- Cyber Readiness Institute19Microsoft Digital Defense Report\|October 2021TOCINTRODUCTIONTHE STATE OF CYBERCRIMENATION STATE THREATSSUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITYHYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITYDISINFORMATIONACTIONABLE INSIGHTSTEAMSIntroduction The cybercrime economy and services Ransomware and extortion Phishing and other malicious email Malware Malicious domains Adversarial machine learningPhishing and

While a lot of focus is givento credential phishing, malicious emails are used inmultiple types of cyber incidents. Microsoft securityresearchers observe the following three mostcommon types of malicious emails:PHISHINGPhishing is the most common type of maliciousemail observed in our threat signals. These emailsare designed to trick an individual into sharingsensitive information, such as usernames andpasswords, with an attacker. To do this, attackerswill craft emails using a variety of themes, suchas productivity tools, password resets, or othernotifications with a sense of urgency to lure a userto click on a link.The phishing webpages used in these attacks mayutilize malicious domains, such as those purchasedand operated by the attacker, or compromiseddomains, where the attacker abuses a vulnerabilityin a legitimate website to host malicious content.The phishing sites frequently copy well\-known,legitimate login pages, such as Office 365 or Google,to trick users into inputting their credentials. Oncethe user inputs their credentials, they will oftenbe redirected to a legitimate final sitesuch asthe real Office 365 login pageleaving the userunaware that actors have obtained their credentials.Meanwhile, the entered credentials are stored orsent to the attacker for later abuse or sale.Attackers also use consent phishing to send userslinks that, if clicked, will grant the attacker accessand permissions to applications, such as via OAuth2\.0 authorization protocol. In these instances, usersmay unwittingly grant the attackers permissions toapplications that enable them to access a wealth ofsensitive information.The number of phishing emails observed inMicrosoft Exchange global mail flow increasedduring the period from June 2020 through June2021\.

learningMachine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI)technique that can be used in numerous applications,including cybersecurity. In responsible ML innovation,data scientists and developers build, train, anddeploy ML models to understand, protect, andcontrol data and processes to build trusted solutions.However, adversaries can attack these ML\-drivensystems. The methods underpinning the productionML systems are systematically vulnerable to a newclass of vulnerabilities across the ML supply chaincollectively known as adversarial ML. Adversariescan exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate AIsystems and alter their behavior to serve a maliciousend goal.The adversarial ML threat 
matrixMicrosoft worked with MITRE to create theAdversarial ML Threat Matrix because we believe thefirst step in empowering security teams to defendagainst attacks on ML systems is to have a frameworkthat systematically organizes the techniquesemployed by malicious adversaries in subvertingML systems. We hope that the security communitycan use the tabulated tactics and techniques tobolster their monitoring strategies around theirorganizations mission\-critical ML systems.1\.Primary audience is security analysts:We think that securing ML systems is aninfosec problem. The goal of the AdversarialML Threat Matrix is to position attacks onML systems in a framework where securityanalysts can orient themselves in these newand upcoming threats. The matrix is structuredlike the ATT\&CK framework, owing to itswide adoption among the security analystcommunity. This way, security analysts have afamiliar framework to learn about threats toML systems, which are inherently different fromtraditional attacks on corporate networks.2\.Grounded in real attacks on ML systems:We seeded this framework with a curated setof vulnerabilities and adversary behaviorsthat Microsoft and MITRE vetted to beeffective against production ML systems,enabling security analysts to focus on realisticthreats. We also incorporated learnings fromMicrosofts vast experience in this space intothe framework. For instance, we found thatmodel stealing is not the end goal of theattacker but in fact leads to more insidiousmodel evasion. We also found that whenattacking an ML system, attackers use acombination of traditional techniques likephishing and lateral movement alongsideadversarial ML techniques.Intentional failure modes in MLMicrosoft has incorporated AI\- and ML\-specificsecurity practices into its Security DevelopmentLifecycle (SDL) to protect Microsoft products andservices against these attacks. In addition to threatdetection and mitigation development work andautomation, we have published guidance on stepscustomers can take to build defense in depth intotheir own AI and ML systems.The centerpiece of the materials weve published iscalled Failure Modes in Machine Learning,26 whichlays out the terminology we developed jointly withthe Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society atHarvard University. It includes vocabulary that canbe used to describe intentional failures caused byan adversary attempting to alter results or steal analgorithm, as well as vocabulary for unintentionalfailures such as a system that produces results thatmight be unsafe.26 https:docs.microsoft.comen\-ussecurityengineeringfailure\-modes\-in\-machine\-learning42Microsoft Digital Defense Report\|October 2021TOCINTRODUCTIONTHE STATE OF CYBERCRIMENATION STATE THREATSSUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITYHYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY DISINFORMATION ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS TEAMSIntroduction The cybercrime economy and services Ransomware and extortion Phishing and other malicious email Malware Malicious domains Adversarial machine learningAttacks on ML modelsAttackDescriptionExampleEvasion attackAttacker modifies the

In this way, a self\-driving car could be made to

By submitting antivirus software as malware, 
an adversary can force its misclassification as 
malicious thereby eliminating the use of the 
antivirus software on client systems. This could 
leave critical infrastructure systems open to 
attack.Healthcare information
An adversary could look at a model trained on a 
body of data consisting of people with a specific 
surgical procedure. By knowing that a particular 
individuals data was in the training set, an 
adversary would then know the individual had the 
surgical procedure. This privacy violation could 
then be leveraged publicly.Finance algorithms

Froma systems security perspective, it is instructive toconsider black\-box evasion attacks, in which anattacker may have no specific knowledge of theinner workings of the ML model but instead effectschange by submitting inputs and observing thecorresponding system output. This threat modelis common to many AI systems hosted as a cloudservice or on a consumer device, for example, and isa concern for models in finance, healthcare, defense,fraud, and security.As weve seen with security research into pastvulnerabilities,27 a pronounced uptick in researchpublications is soon followed by active exploitation.In anticipation of such a shift to focus on datapoisoning attacks, Microsoft continues to focuson designing threat detections and mitigationsto protect ML models and their datasets againstthese threats. Mitigations in this space can also bebeneficial to detecting non\-malicious training datadrift, giving data scientists greater insight into thequality of their data over time and highlightinganomalies for investigation.ML modeldata poisoningWe are seeing a trend shift in adversarial MLsecurity research. While in past years there was afocus on highly visible model evasion attacks wherethe fragility of some ML models could be easilydemonstrated, the focus of security researchersis broadening to include less noticeable attacks.For example, in data poisoning attacks, the targetis the training data that the ML models are builtfrom. As new data is aggregated and incorporatedinto a dataset for training, it becomes increasinglyimportant to validate that new training data has notbeen compromised. We have evidence of customerML model compromise resulting from adversarialcontamination of training data which, when leftundetected, becomes an equally trusted part ofexisting training datasets. Without automationmeasuring for statistical drift in growing datasets,these types of attacks largely go undetected until anML model has a critical failure.The risk of adversaries evading an 
ML model exists in every domain.Sophisticated black\-box evasion attacks againstML models have been demonstrated repeatedlyby white\-hat researchers by using algorithms thatiteratively determine what input will cause anintegrity violation. Today, however, threat actors inthe wild may also attempt evasion of ML systemsin some domains, but usually do so throughmanual rather than algorithmic means and do notnecessarily focus exclusively on ML as the evasiontarget. For example, content moderation filters arebypassed by mischievous or economically motivatedusers by obscuring payload content in creativeways. Security products that include antimalware orantiphishing models are evaded by adversaries usingseveral obfuscation techniques. That these targetsystems rely on ML is not necessarily a considerationin these practical manual evasion attacks.Whether or not an adversary is present in yourbusiness domain, the risk of adversaries evadingan ML model exists in every domain. An ML modelis an imperfect summary of a dataset, and assuch, models have intrinsic failure modes evenwhen trained on an ideal dataset. It is generallyunderstood that the feasibility of evasion is aproperty of all ML models, rather than a failuremode to which only a few are susceptible to. Theseintegrity violations may rarely be encounteredduring nominal use of the ML model but can bereadily discovered by an adversary who is explicitlyoptimizing for the worst\-case conditions necessaryto cause them.27 Such as MD5, SHA1, SSLv23, and TLS 1\.044Microsoft Digital Defense Report\|October 2021TOCINTRODUCTIONTHE STATE OF CYBERCRIMENATION STATE THREATSSUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITYHYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITYDISINFORMATIONACTIONABLE INSIGHTSTEAMSIntroduction The cybercrime economy and services Ransomware and extortion Phishing and other malicious email Malware Malicious domains Adversarial machine learningBased on learnings from internal and externalAI risk managementWhat were doing to stay ahead

Somegroups, like North Korean THALLIUM, had a low success rate, becausethey used strategies like large\-scale spear\-phishing campaigns thatrely more on using a wide net than a surgical strike. Password spraysare another example of a tactic with a low success rate, but where theattackers understand the success rate will be low.

The outsized proportion of attacks coming from North Korea isa result of the strategy taken by threat actors THALLIUM and CERIUM.These groups rely on large quantities of attacks.

offensive actorsA growing industry of companies called privatesector offensive actors (PSOAs) create and sellmalicious cyber technologies that enable theircustomers to break into peoples computers, phones,and internet\-connected devices. These privatecompanies may not be nation state actors, but theirbusiness model presents a dangerous and rapidlygrowing challenge for organizations, companies,and individual consumers. These tools also threatenmany global human rights efforts, as they have beenobserved targeting and surveilling dissidents, humanrights defenders, journalists, civil society advocates,and other private citizens.In December 2020, Microsofts efforts to protectour customers from the threats presented by thistechnology led us to file an amicus brief in supportof WhatsApps case against Israel\-based NSOGroup Technologies (NSO Group) along with Cisco,GitHub, Google, LinkedIn, VMware, and InternetAssociation.59The brief encouraged the court toreject NSO Groups position that it is not responsiblefor the use of its surveillance and espionageproducts by governments.

protections 
requiredNation state actors have demonstrated that theywill go to great lengths to accomplish a missionto collect information or intelligence. The skill andpersistence of malicious nation state actors increasethe difficulty of detecting and protecting againstadvanced threats. Their impact can be wide rangingand highly damaging. These adversaries are well\-funded, employ techniques of tremendous breadthand sophistication, and are motivated by objectivesof national significancewhich may lead to theircompromising networks for unexpected purposes.More than other adversaries, nation state attackerstarget individuals specifically for access to theirconnections, communications, and information. Atthe conclusion of an operation, they will assess whatwent well and what did not and refine tactics andtechniques for more successful future missions.Therefore, defense\-in\-depth strategies againstnation state adversaries should include educatingemployees on how to avoid being targetedthemselves. Applying Zero Trust principlesacrosscorporate resources helps more effectively adapt tothe complexity of the modern environment, embracethe mobile workforce, and protect people, devices,applications, and data no matter where they arelocated or the scale of threats they face.While nation state attacks are often sophisticatedor can deploy 0\-day vulnerabilities to gain access tonetworks, defense\-in\-depth strategies and proactivemonitoring can greatly reduce the actors dwelltime on a network, potentially enabling disruptionof their activities before they reach their goals.Above and beyond enabling foundational basicslike MFA, IT departments should prioritize steps tomitigate lateral movement by attackers; specifically,credential hygiene and network segmentation. Tolimit the damage of data exfiltration, informationrights management can be applied to files. Buildingprotective controls across your managed identities,devices, applications, data, infrastructure, andnetworks will raise the threshold for attackers,improving your organizations ability to detectanomalous activity in the environment.59 Amicus Brief 12\.20\.2020 (microsoft.com) 60 Hooking Candiru: Another Mercenary Spyware Vendor Comes into Focus \- The Citizen Lab 61 CVE\-2021\-31979 \- Security Update Guide \- Microsoft \- Windows Kernel Elevation of PrivilegeVulnerability 62 CVE\-2021\-33771 \- Security Update Guide \- Microsoft \- Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability 63 Fighting cyberweapons built by private businesses \- Microsoft On the Issues69Microsoft Digital Defense Report\|October 2021TOCINTRODUCTIONTHE STATE OF CYBERCRIMENATION STATE THREATSSUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITYHYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITYDISINFORMATIONACTIONABLE INSIGHTSTEAMSCHAPTER 4Supply chain, IoT, and OT securityIntroductionChallenges in managing risk associated with the supplier ecosystemHow Microsoft thinks about supply chainIoT and OT threat landscapeThe 7 properties of highly secured devicesApplying a Zero Trust approach to IoT solutionsIoT at the intersection of cybersecurity and sustainabilityIoT security policy considerationsTOCINTRODUCTIONTHE STATE OF CYBERCRIMENATION STATE THREATSSUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITYHYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITYDISINFORMATIONACTIONABLE INSIGHTSTEAMSIntroduction Managing supplier ecosystem risk How Microsoft thinks about supply chain IoT and OT threat landscape7 properties of secured devices Applying Zero Trust to IoTIoT and sustainabilityIoT policyINTRODUCTION: Innovation\-driven opportunity in an

OT vulnerabilitiesThe Microsoft Defender for IoT team conductsresearch on various types of equipment rangingfrom legacy industrial control system controllersto cutting\-edge IoT sensors. Upon discovery of avulnerability, the findings are shared with relevantvendors through a responsible disclosure processled by the Microsoft Security Response Center andthe US Department of Homeland Security (DHS),enabling these vendors to investigate and patchthe vulnerability.In April 2021, we uncovered a series of criticalmemory allocation vulnerabilities in IoT and OTdevices that adversaries could exploit to bypasssecurity controls to execute malicious code or causea system crash. The group of vulnerabilities wasdubbed BadAlloc. These remote code executionvulnerabilities affected a wide range of industriesand verticals, from consumer and medical IoT, toindustrial IoT, OT, and industrial control systems.They covered more than 25 common vulnerabilitiesand exposures (CVEs). In the context of ITenvironments, an exploitation of such a vulnerabilitycan result in a loss of confidentiality. In the contextof OT environments, it can be used to trigger adisruption of operations.The vulnerabilities stem from using vulnerablememory functions, such as malloc, calloc, realloc,memalign, valloc, pvalloc, and others. Our researchThe following is an example of BadAlloc:showed that memory allocation implementationswritten throughout the years as part of IoT devicesand embedded software have not incorporatedproper input validations. Without these inputvalidations, an attacker could exploit the memoryallocation function to perform a heap overflow,resulting in execution of malicious code on atarget device.The memory allocation vulnerabilities can beinvoked by calling the memory allocation function,such as malloc(VALUE), with the VALUE parameterderived dynamically from external input and beinglarge enough to trigger an integer overflow orwraparound. The concept is as follows: Whensending this value, the returned outcome is afreshly allocated memory buffer. While the sizeof the allocated memory remains small due tothe wraparound, the payload associated with thememory allocation exceeds the actual allocatedbuffer, resulting in a heap overflow. This heapoverflow enables an attacker to execute maliciouscode on the target device.BadAlloc is a case that illustrates the extensiveimpact these vulnerabilities can have because therisk exists in IoT and OT devices across all majorindustries. This example highlights one of thebiggest challenges in mitigating IT, IoT, and OT risks:they share attack surfaces, and attackers look at theentire ecosystem.The protection of IoT and OT devices fromto ensure that modern digital environments areexposure to IT risks becomes more important asnot held back by threats from legacy technologythey converge.

We looked atover 280,000 attacks and analyzed the password data we collected. Perhaps unsurprisingly we saw that 96% ofattacks used a password with fewer than 10 characters, 92% had fewer than 8, and slightly more shockingly, 72%of all attacks required only trying a password of 6 characters or less. Within these password attempts, only 2%included a special character and 72% didnt even contain a number.The attacks we are seeing in the wild line up with the GCA data and other reports.

Efforts to fabricate falsehoods for the purposes of manipulating the masses have a long history. However, new 
forms of disinformation have come to the fore over the last decade, enabled by advances in computing methods 
and infrastructure that have transformed the power, scope, and efficiency of disinformation campaigns.Widely used consumer platforms and services, such as social media, creator platforms, search engines, and messaging 
services, now provide state and non\-state actors with powerful channels for distributing disinformation. Beyond

Deepfakes use two algorithms: the first algorithm creates a video, and the second one tries to determine if the video is real or not. If thesecond algorithm can tell that the video is fake, the first algorithm tries again, until the resulting image looks sufficiently believable.111Microsoft Digital Defense Report\|October 2021TOCINTRODUCTIONTHE STATE OF CYBERCRIMENATION STATE THREATSSUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITYHYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITYDISINFORMATIONACTIONABLE INSIGHTSTEAMSIntroduction Disinformation as an emerging threat Mitigation through media literary Disinformation as an enterprise disruptor Campaign security and election integrityIn the attention economy, websites and platformsearn revenue from the time users spend onthem.

Thedifference between a disinformation attack anda cyberattack is the target; disinformation is alsoan attack and compromise of our cognitive being.While cyberattacks are exploits of computerinfrastructure to create disruption, disinformationexploits human infrastructure (our inherentcognitive biases, logical fallacies, and psychologicalvulnerabilities), and the attack compromises logical,analytical, and critical thinking.We can therefore think of the threat posed bydisinformation and computational propagandaas cognitive hacking. A cognitive hack attemptsto change the target audiences thoughts andactions using disinformation to manipulate the waythey perceive reality. Nefarious actors accomplishcognitive hacks utilizing various techniques,including manipulating, mis\-contextualizing, ormisappropriating information. Ultimately, thesehacks can create social discord, exacerbatepolarization, influence election outcomes, disruptdemocratic principles, enable financial fraud, andthreaten life and property.Both disinformation and cyberattacks are used by anadversary to achieve disruption. A well\-coordinateddisinformation campaign can fill the broadcastand social channels with false information andnoise, creating narratives that play with emotionsand drown out the true narrative. This maneuveris similar to a distributed denial of service (DDoS)attack that floods the target services and networkswith superfluous requests to connect and overloadthe system to prevent legitimate requests frombeing fulfilled. Disinformation can also be usedfor social engineering threats on a mass scale. Likephishing attacks to compromise IT systems fordata extraction, disinformation campaigns play onemotions, giving cybercriminals another feasiblemethod for scams. Deepfake videos and audiocan trick employees into releasing or sharing logincredentials, which can then be used to gain accessto an enterprises network.DeepfakesDeepfakes are photos, videos, or audio filesmanipulated by AI in hard\-to\-detect ways. Theweaponization of deepfakes can have a massiveimpact on an economy and national security.By eroding public trust in the media, deepfakesundermine the credibility of journalism. As thiscredibility is eroded, deepfakes also give rise to theLiars Dividend phenomenon. In an environmentwhere it is unclear what is real and what is fake, itbecomes easier to discount any inconvenient orunpopular truth as fake. As an example, deepfakescould enable a public figure to claim that their realactions are just a fake.The proliferation of deepfake technology can directlyharm individuals.

The cybersecurity bellcurve shows the activities that will have the biggestimpact on reducing threats. Some of those actions,the impact they have, and recommendations forimplementing them are described here.Enable multifactor authenticationThis continues to be the top recommendation as itwas last year.

The introduction of passwordlesstechnology and architectures makes this easier foremployees and customers to use and also providesmore security than traditional text (SMS) or voiceapproaches.

As we moveinto a world where we increasingly collaborate andshare data, its important to ensure we understandwhat data we have, classify it accurately, and applysensitivity labels as appropriate. This practice willenable us to use information protection and dataloss prevention technologies to protect data withmore confidence.In the event of a breach, these practices can alsohelp security teams to know where the most sensitivedata is and whether it was exposed to attackers.Isolate legacy systemsNot every system is capable of running the tools toenable Zero Trust.
