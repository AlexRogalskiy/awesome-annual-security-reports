Critical bugs in major server clients and in popular printertechnology were also exploited.Our research into the first few months of the year examines dangerous vulnerabilities acrossdifferent types of devices and operating systems, including the threats targeting these flaws.One example of this is our three\-part investigation into the security of low\-powered LongRange Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology that is widely used in internet of things(IoT) configurations around the world. We also analyzed threats aimed at new Mac devices,specifically machines that use ARM64 architecture, as well as vulnerabilities in Windowsoperating systems and Linux machines.Covid\-19 threats continued as well, as pandemic\-themed scams began revolving arounda much\-awaited vaccine and plans about its distribution rather than the disease\-focusedtopics previously seen in 2020\.

Some keep terabytes of stolen data online for over a yearand threaten to leak increasing amounts of data over time, though most keep stolen data publicly availablefor several months. Some of these data leak sites are on Tor\-hidden servers, while others are hosted usingbulletproof hosting. RaaS actors also use commercially available and free file\-sharing platforms, or evenhost files on websites on the clear web.4 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportHow Active Were Ransomware Actors in 
the First Half of 2021?Our data shows that over 7\.3 million ransomware threats were detected in the first six months of 2021,which is almost half the number of detections we found in the same period in 2020\. There are severalfactors that might have contributed to this decrease. First, it signals the shift to the more targeted modernransomware3thatwehavebeenanalyzing,whichinvolvesattackersmovingfromthelesseffective,quantity\-focused model of ransomware to big\-game hunting. We can also attribute this decrease to animprovement in the detection and blocking capabilities of security solutions. Threats were stopped andblockedbeforetheyevenreachedusers,andsodetectionsalsodropped.Itsimportanttonotethatmodern ransomware uses phishing and exploits as the first step in the infection process, so when securitysolutions block this initial intrusion, the deployment of ransomware is prevented. Furthermore, an incidentwith the DarkSide ransomware brought heightened attention to ransomware operators, which might haveprompted some of them to lie low. Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies across the world conductedaseriesofransomwareoperationstakedownsthatmighthaveleftanimpactonwide\-reachingactivegroups.The WannaCry and Locky families made up most of the detection count, continuing the trend we saw inour 2020 Annual Roundup.4 WannaCry is a familiar threat that started plaguing enterprises and users since2017; however, this year, there was a marked decrease in WannaCry detection numbers. The longevity ofthis family shows how long a network worm can persist if devices are not patched properly, even whenthe actors are not maintaining the attack.Meanwhile, DarkSide, Nefilim, and Conti are also among the top 10 families detected in this period andstand out significantly in terms of attack scope, tools, and techniques.In terms of targeted industries, ransomware actors focused on many of the same sectors as last year.Themostaffectedorganizationswereinbanking,government,andmanufacturing.Wesawasurgeinransomware attempts on banking groups, although RaaS is opportunistic with regard to its targeting style.This means that attackers are not likely singling out banking businesses in particular.5 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportEmail (TOTAL)URLFile (TOTAL)1,375,39405,453,2436,284,7872,898,7483,079,6432,856,8222020 1H2021 1H8MFigure 1\.

The top three malware families that affected the top five industriesin the first half of 2020 and the first half of 20217 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportThe Nefilim ransomware continued to target companies with billion\-dollar yearly revenues, a tactic that weanalyzed as the model for modern ransomware.5 In May, the DarkSide6 ransomware shut down ColonialPipeline,acompanyresponsibleforprovidingfueltonearlyhalftheUSEastCoast.Asaresult,theFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had to declare a state of emergency in 18 statestohelpwiththeshortages.Theincidentwassoconsiderablethatitspawnedagroupthatposed7asDarkSide and sent extortionist emails to companies generic email addresses. There was also DarkSideLinux,8 another version of the ransomware that targets files related to virtual machines (VMs) on VMwareESXI servers. It kills VMs, encrypts files on the infected machine, collects system information, and sendsit to a remote server. Meanwhile, Conti9 is known as the successor to the popular Ryuk ransomware family,with its threat actors victimizing targets using the same methods used with Ryuk. In fact, Trickbot, Emotet,and BazarLoader are now used to distribute Conti.Inthesucceedingsections,wediscussthesefamilies,aswellasotherransomwareattacksanddevelopments that were significant in the first half of 2021\. The tactics and tools used to conduct thesemalicious activities show how ransomware has evolved over the years.How Did Modern Ransomware Spread 
in the First Half of 2021?Modern ransomware attackers are now becoming more mature by using APT\-level tools and techniquesto access and move deeper into the victims system, exfiltrate data, and then deliver their payloads. InMay 2021, we saw that the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability called ProxyLogon,10 discovered in2020, was used to deliver three types of malware, including the BlackKingdom ransomware. One otherexampleistheaforementionedransomwareConti,11whichtargetedIrelandsDepartmentofHealthinMay.12 Conti has been seen compromising victims through firewall vulnerabilities CVE\-2018\-13379 andCVE\-2018\-13374, which are more sophisticated entry points than traditional ransomware. After exploitingthe vulnerable firewall, the ransomware tries to move laterally within the system.REvil or Sodinokibi13 was yet another modern ransomware that was active throughout 2021, specificallytargeting tech company Acer in March, Apple in April, and the worlds largest meat processor, JBS, inJune.14 This family also used techniques that indicate a targeted approach. For example, it used the remotecode execution (RCE) CVE\-2019\-2725 vulnerability, and we observed that it was loaded in the memoryof PowerShell through reflective\-load instead of binary execution. The Hello ransomware,15 which uses.hello as its extension, arrives at a target system via Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability CVE\-2019\-0604\.Our analysis revealed that after the exploit is abused for intrusion, the China Chopper web shell (detectedby Trend Micro as Backdoor.ASP.WEBSHELL.SMYAAIAS) is deployed to execute PowerShell commandsto facilitate the succeeding malicious actions and ultimately push the payload.8 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportSophisticated methods of accessing and entering an organization sometimes come from a source outsidethe group that actually creates or distributes the ransomware. This is where affiliate programs come in.These programs, which flourished in the first half of 2021, are basically collaborations that allow actorsto share their tools, such as customizable software, new and readily available technologies for improvedvictim\-targeting, and more. Specifically, we saw many actors with access to compromised assets (suchas avenues into a victims network) collaborate with other actors who hold ransomware. Nevertheless,while this means that certain cybercriminals can take advantage of other groups tools and resources,there are downsides to this option.For example, the high\-profile DarkSide attacks in May had multiple victims apart from Colonial Pipeline,and it was reported that there were different affiliate groups behind the attacks. This is one of the issuesthatarisewithaffiliateprograms:Theransomwaregroupdoesnothaveoversightintothevictimsofits partners. For its part, the DarkSide group apologized16 and said that it will target less controversialorganizations in the future, adding that it will start checking companies that its partners want to targetand encrypt.It should be noted that these ransomware also use traditional means to gain initial access into a victimssystem: malspam emails with spear\-phishing links or attachments, remote desktop protocol (RDP) accessthat uses valid accounts, compromised websites, and others.How Was Data Exfiltrated in 2021?After initial access, lateral movement within a victimsPredictionssystemisakeyphaseinthemodernransomwareprocess.GroupsusethismovementeithertoidentifyvaluabledatawithinthevictimorganizationInoursecuritypredictionslastyear,wespeculated that there would be an increasefor exfiltration, or to drop malicious payloads.

These data leak sites are on public file\-sharing platforms and sometimes on the clearweb. We also noted that the exfiltration tools used by ransomware groups are usually open\-source, freepublic resources.For example, we found that Conti operators use the cloud storage synchronization tool Rclone to uploadfiles to the Mega cloud storage service. Similarly, DarkSide operators use Mega client for exfiltrating filesto cloud storage, 7\-Zip for archiving, and PuTTY application for network file transfers.After data is exfiltrated, the payload is dropped.

This is another feature that makes modern ransomware attacksseem like nation\-state APT attacks.

Ransomware Gangs?Wementionedpreviouslythatransomwaredistributorssometimesuselegitimatetoolstoperformmalicious activities, but the scope of misuse is worth exploring further. On their own, most of the toolsexploited by ransomware are used to help in security research or to improve efficiency. Many of them areopen\-source and can be used and modified by the public freely. Conversely, the features that make themgood tools also make them useful for cybercriminals.18ToolIntended useHow it is used for

For example, Nefilimuses AdFind, Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, Process Hacker, PsExec, and MegaSync. Primarily, ransomwareoperators opt for these tools for evasion. Since these tools are recognized as legitimate, they might beable to conduct malicious activity while remaining undetected by simple security software. Additionally,since they are open\-source, criminals can alter their code to tweak certain parts that trigger antimalwaresoftware.Enterprise and Government Response 
to Ransomware AttacksColonial Pipeline reportedly paid US$4\.4 million in ransom to the DarkSide actors. Fortunately, in June,theUSDepartmentofJusticeannouncedthatitrecovered63\.7bitcoins19ofthepaymentgiven.Lawenforcement agencies were able to track multiple transfers of bitcoin to a specific address. However, thefull ransom amount was not recovered, and the ransomware group walked away with more than half ofthe payment.It seems that Colonial Pipeline was prepared for such an incident, since the company had cyber insurancewith Lloyds of London and Beazley,20 which covered it for at least US$15 million. However, it was unclearif the company used its policy to pay. This is not an unusual scenario: In the past two years, weve seencompaniesinvolvedinransomwareattacksutilizecyberinsurancetodealwiththeransompayments.In2019,NorskHydroreceivedUS$20\.2million21incyberinsurancefromproviderAIG.Inareportoncyber insurance claims made in the first half of 2021, insurance company Coalition details22 that 41% ofreported claims were made as a result of ransomware attacks. Coalition also reports that ransomwareattacks are growing more severe, with the ransom demands affecting policy holders increasing 47% fromthe first to the second quarter of 2020\.11 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportCyber insurance is supposed to protect enterprises from the fallout of cyberattacks; however, critics ofthis system argue that insurance encourages ransomware victims to simply pay the ransom and collectinsurance rather than invest in security to deter hackers.On the administrative side, the US Department of the Treasury added multiple crimeware gangs to itssanctions program.23 This means that US entities and citizens are prohibited from conducting any sort ofbusiness with any of these gangs, including paying them ransom. The Treasury Departments Office ofForeign Assets Control (OFAC) issued advisories24 reiterating sanctions risks associated with ransomwarepayments and highlighted that companies facilitating ransomware payments on behalf of a victim mightviolate OFAC regulations.Legislation is also being proposed to create special funds for government ransomware payments. In NewYork, under proposed bill S7246,25 state and local taxpayer funds would no longer be used to pay ransomsfor ransomware attacks. Instead, a cybersecurity enhancement fund would be created to distribute grantsand upgrade the cybersecurity of areas with populations of a million or less.Although organizations hit with ransomware are tempted to simply pay the ransom to recover their data,securityandgovernmentagenciesaregenerallyopposedtothisideaforacoupleofreasons.Firstly,there is no guarantee that the data will or can be returned by ransomware operators, and the data, evenif returned, might also be corrupted. Secondly, the money will be used by these criminal gangs for furthermaliciousactivities.Therehasalsobeenahistoricalprecedentofransomwaredistributorsattackingpaying victims again. A 2020 security report from Cybereason shows that 80%26 of organizations thatpaid ransom demands experienced a second attack. Indeed, ransomware distributors could be markingtheir paying victims as susceptible targets that they can come back to for more ill\-gained profits.Ransomware Arrests: Egregor, Clop, 
EmotetIn the first few months of 2021, law enforcement agencies across the world successfully dismantled long\-running cybercriminal operations and arrested key players in malicious hacking groups.In early 2021, law enforcement teams from Netherlands, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom,France, Lithuania, Canada, and Ukraine coordinated in international activities by Europol and Eurojustand disrupted one of the most significant and long\-running botnets of the past decade, Emotet,27 dubbedbysomeoutletsastheworldsmostdangerousmalware.28TrendMicrowasactuallythefirstsecurityservice to discover and profile Emotet in 2014\. Emotet evolved from spreading banking trojans to sellingmalware loader services and has victimized over 1\.6 million machines.29 Notably, though Emotet is notransomware, it served as a major enabler of ransomware distribution. For example, in 2019, Emotet wasused in a two\-layered attack30 where it dropped the Trickbot trojan that in turn stole information and then12 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity Reportloaded the Ryuk ransomware. The danger in Emotet is its resilience and evasion capabilities: It is ableto spread threats laterally on victims networks despite only having access to a few devices. Luckily, inJanuary of this year, law enforcement teams conducted Operation Ladybird and took over its command\-and\-control (C\&C) infrastructure and arrested key members of the group.In March, a joint operation between French and Ukrainian police saw the arrest of several members of theEgregor ransomware cartel in Ukraine. The group began operations in September 2020 and operated ona RaaS business model. They also depended on other cybercriminal groups to orchestrate intrusions intovictims networks and deploy ransomware. Victims of this gang were often listed on the Egregor leak siteto shame them into paying the ransom. News reports say that the arrests have made an impact on theEgregor infrastructure, contributing to the shutdown of both C\&C servers and the leak site.In June, members of the Clop ransomware gang were also arrested in Ukraine through the efforts of aninternational group. Like Egregor, Clop operates a leak site where, oddly enough, there has been activityeven after the arrests. Aside from ransomware, the gang was also involved in money\-laundering activities.13 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportAPTs Find Exploitable Cracks

The goals differ for each operation, from stealing financialinformation and loading cryptocurrency miners to taking valuable data. In the first half of 2021, APT groupscontinued to broaden target bases and update their toolkits, focusing on stealthy infiltration techniquesand finding new ways to abuse legitimate tools and systems to conduct malicious actions.They also continued to search for and exploit vulnerabilities in widely used enterprise tools like Kubernetes,AWScloudservers,andpopularemailplatforms.Meanwhile,spearphishingremainsaprevalentandsuccessful way into a victims system, despite the fact that attackers have also been using other accessibleentry points like online e\-commerce order forms. TeamTNTThe cybercrime group TeamTNT has a reputation for being resourceful, with its loaded arsenal of hackingtools and capabilities. In 2020, the group attacked exposed Docker APIs with an XMRig cryptocurrencyminer and created and distributed its own IRC (Internet Relay Chat) called TNTbotinger.In March 2021, we found that the group was targeting AWS credentials.31 Upon looking into the serverthatthegroupusedasarepositoryfortheirstolendata,wealsofoundLinuxcryptocurrency\-miningtoolsthattheypushontocompromisedsystems.LaterinMay,wealsosawTeamTNTcompromisingKubernetes32 clusters in the wild and using them to mine cryptocurrency as well.

The campaign used spam emails withmalicious attachments on e\-commerce shops in Japan, Australia, and European countries. However, ourtelemetry shows that since early 2020, Water Pamola started focusing mainly on Japan. We also notedthat these newer attacks are not launched via spam.

As a result ofconsumersincreasedrelianceononlineshopping amid lockdowns around the world,we thought it likely that cybercriminals wouldopt for activities like sabotaging production,transporting fake goods, and trafficking.Earth WendigoTrend Micro discovered an APT campaign that has been going on since May 2019\. It targets governmentorganizations, research institutions, and universities in Taiwan. Investigations reveal that the group aimsto exfiltrate emails from targeted organizations by injecting JavaScript backdoors onto a webmail systemthat is widely used in Taiwan. The malicious script also appends itself to the victims email signature topropagate to other contacts. Since there is no clear connection to any previous attack group, we dubbedthis threat actor as Earth Wendigo.33Inthisattack,avictimwillreceiveaspear\-phishingemailwithanobfuscatedmaliciousJavaScriptembedded, which will load malicious scripts from Earth Wendigos remote server. To evade security checks,the email uses the webmail systems search suggestion function to trigger the webpage to execute themalicious script instead of directly running it.15 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportThe scripts are designed to perform malicious behaviors, including:Stealing browser cookies and webmail session keys and sending them to the remote server.Appendingtheirmaliciousscripttothevictimsemailsignaturetopropagatetheinfectiontothevictims contacts.Exploiting a webmail systems XSS vulnerability to allow their malicious JavaScript to be injected onthe webmail page permanently.RegisteringamaliciousJavaScriptcodetoServiceWorker,awebbrowserfeaturethatallowsJavaScripttointerceptandmanipulateHTTPSrequestsbetweenclientandserver.TheregisteredService Worker script can also hijack login credentials and modify the webmail page to add maliciousscripts in case the attackers are unable to inject the XSS vulnerability mentioned previously.

Earth Vetala created spear\-phishing emails with embeddedlinks to a legitimate file\-sharing service to distribute archives containing these RATs. After successfullyaccessing the victim, attackers download post\-exploitation tools to dump passwords, tunnel their C\&Ccommunication using open\-source tools, and use additional C\&C infrastructure to establish a persistentpresence within targeted hosts and environments.16 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportIron TigerIron Tiger is an APT threat that has historically targeted gambling and betting companies in SoutheastAsia. A recent incident response investigation involving a Philippine\-based gambling company prompteda closer look at the group, and over 18 months we found that they expanded their operations and weretargeting governments, banks, telecommunication providers, and even the energy sector in the MiddleEast and Southeast Asia.The group has also updated their toolkit with a SysUpdate malware variant that now uses five files in itsinfection routine instead of three.35 The group also uses updated rootkits. One of these rootkits is used tohide files at the kernel level and has not previously been associated with this threat actor.The SysUpdate malware was typically loaded in memory by a known method involving three files. In ourrecent analysis of Iron Tiger tools, we found five tools that the group now uses:dlpumgr32\.exe, a legitimate signed file that belongs to the DESlock\+ productDLPPREM32\.DLL, a malicious DLL that is sideloaded by dlpumgr32\.exe and that loads and decodesDLPPREM32\.binDLPPREM32\.bin, a shellcode that decompresses and loads a launcher in memorydata.res, an encrypted file that is decoded by the launcher and contains two SysUpdate versions: onefor a 32\-bit architecture and another for a 64\-bit architectureconfig.res, an encrypted file that is decoded by the launcher and contains the SysUpdate configuration,including the C\&C addressIn summary, the launcher acts as an installer: It will copy the malware to a fixed place and ensure that itruns during the next boot of the infected host.The Iron Tiger threat actors have updated their tools, changed their tactics, techniques, and procedures,and expanded their target base. Different active campaigns with versions of the same tools being usedconcurrently suggest that there might be either subgroups for this threat actor or multiple groups withaccess to the builders of these tools.PlugXTrend Micros Apex One with Endpoint Sensor (iES) recently discovered an attacker attempting to exfiltratesensitive information from a company with PlugX loader,36 a remote access tool (RAT) used in attackstargeting government organizations and related industries.17 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportInitial analysis of this PlugX variant showed that it has three parts: a normal file, a DLL loader that thenormalfileexpectstobepresent,andanencryptedBinaryLargeObject(BLOB)filecontainingthemalicious code.The normal file loads a seemingly ordinary DLL named after a common Microsoft DLL. However, the hashof the DLL does not match any of the known hashes of a normal DLL. After reversing the file, we foundthat it was actually PlugX. We observed the process and found that PlugX decrypts, loads, and executesa DLL file (one named after another Microsoft DLL file) that is actually an encrypted BLOB.Our investigation shows that the attacker also used other tools during the attack. The simplest way tolaunch these tools is to have the injected code in svchost download, drop, and execute the tools. Wenoted that the attacker had a unique way of launching their malicious tools: They made use of a scheduledtask that runs the batch file which, in turn, executes the tool.Evasion techniques like this, in the larger picture of the security landscape, reify the urgency of relyingon security solutions that can flag anomalous events, correlate them, and associate them with knowntechniques that attackers previously used. With these solutions, companies can look forward to a morecomprehensive view of threats to their systems.18 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportA Look at Upgraded Criminal

In particular, we saw malware campaigns targeting vulnerabilitiesin Mac operating systems and web browsers, as well as spam emails spreading an information stealer.Cryptocurrency accounts were also a popular target, as we saw multiple malicious actors trying to collecttrading account information and cryptocurrency wallet details.XCESSETXCSSETisaMacmalwarethatvictimizesusersbyinfectingXcodeprojects.Althoughitwasinitiallyreported as a malware family, it is now classified as an ongoing campaign in light of our recent findings.In the first half of 2021, XCSSET quickly trailed Apple as the company moved from Intel to processorsthat use the ARM64 architecture. It adapted to both ARM64 and x86\_x64 Macs and also changed itspayload. Previously, XCSSET exploited two macOS vulnerabilities, while a third exploit was found takingadvantage of browsers in the operating system to implant a universal cross\-site scripting (UXSS) injection.However, new samples that can run on Macs with the new M1 chip have been discovered, and theseaffect macOS 11 (Big Sur) as well.The malware works by using the development version of Safari to load malicious Safari frameworks andrelated JavaScript backdoors from its C\&C server. It hosts Safari update packages on the C\&C server,then downloads and installs packages for the targets version of the operating system. To adapt to thenewly released Big Sur, new packages for Safari 14 were added. Fake apps for Big Sur were also created,with modified icons that are convincingly similar to the legitimate app.19 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportXCSSEThasalsobeenupdatedtostealconfidentialdatafromvariouswebsites,twoofwhicharecryptocurrency platforms:163\.comhuobi.combinance.comnncall.netenvato.comlogin.live.comFor cryptocurrency\-trading platform Huobi, the malware is not only capable of stealing account informationbut also of replacing the address in a users cryptocurrency wallet, a new feature that did not exist in theprevious version.PandaStealerIn April, we found a new information stealer called Panda Stealer (a modified fork of Collector Stealer)being delivered mainly to targets in the United States, Australia, Japan, and Germany. Panda Stealer isdeployed using spam emails requesting business quotes; this pushes victims to open the malicious Excelfile attachments. We identified two infection chains in this case: One was an XLSM attachment containingmacros that download a loader, which is responsible for downloading and executing the main stealer. Theother infection chain has an XLS file containing an Excel formula that utilizes a PowerShell command toaccess a Pastebin alternative, paste.ee, which in turn accesses a second encrypted PowerShell command.Panda Stealer also utilizes a fileless approach in its distribution to evade detection.Once installed, Panda Stealer can collect details like private keys and records of past transactions fromits victims various digital currency wallets, including Dash, Bytecoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Not onlydoes it target cryptocurrency wallets, it also steals credentials from other applications such as NordVPN,Telegram,Discord,andSteam.Itisalsocapableoftakingscreenshotsoftheinfectedcomputerandexfiltrating data from browsers like cookies, passwords, and cards.Covid\-19\-Related Scams and 
Fake ProductsWe observed that in the first half of 2021, many users were inundated with scams that revolved aroundthe response to Covid\-19 or the effects of the pandemic. For example, we found that cybercriminals usedtext messages to lure people into sharing their personal information.37 As further proof of cybercriminalsrelentless tendency to exploit any situation, they also lured victims with promises of the vaccine or offersof a stimulus package for unemployed or struggling individuals.20 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportMostofthesecriminalactivitiesconsistedofPredictionsphishingandsocial\-engineeringplotsthattriedtotakeadvantageoftheconstantfluxofinformationongovernmentpandemicresponseandnewsaboutregulationsandlockdowns,asevidencedbythemanythreatsthatledtowebsitesdedicatedtoCovid\-19\-focusedscamsandmisinformation.OnAspartofoursecuritypredictionsfor2021,weforesawthatthreatactorswouldexploitmisinformationtolureusersintoselecting links or downloading attachments.Consideringtheanticipationlastyearthe other hand, some threats led to malicious mobilearound vaccine development, we predictedapplicationsforvaccineregistrationortomedicalthatcybercriminalswouldresorttousingresponsesites.MaliciousappsmasqueradingasCovid\-19testingregistrationsincludeV\-AlertCOVID\-19 (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS\_Cerberus.HRXC)and Covid\-19Test(detectedbyTrendMicroasAndroidOS\_Anubis.GCL).Bothoftheseappswerespottedspreadingthebankingmalware Anubis and Cerberus.theCovid\-19vaccineasaphishinglure.Wealsoanticipatedthattheywouldturntoemails,fakeapps,maliciousdomains,andevensocialmediatopurportedlyofferhealth information, fake vaccines, and spotson inoculation waitlists.TikTok88Free Laptop (Students)37Vaccine Register14CoWIN\-Helps11Airtel7Cricket Match2Sahaita Gov15G Converter1Others30100Figure 5\.

There are many possible factors that could have contributed to this decline,suchasheightenedsecurityfrombothenterprisesandusers,improveddetectionandblockingfromonline applications and software vectors, and even a decline in cybercriminal interest in using Covid\-19as a topic for lures. We also noted that threats using this topic were found mostly in the US and Germany.Ultimately, despite the decline, scams that revolve around the pandemic and the vaccine cold chain callfor sustained vigilance, as they can lead not only to the collection of private information but also to theendangerment of lives as the world continues to grapple with Covid\-19\.1H 20208,840,3361H 20214,409,392010MFigure 6\.

This technology can be scattered across large areas and wirelessly connects to theinternet via radio waves. It can also be used in monitoring sensors (either for weather sensors or trackingsensors), asset management, controlled automation, climate control, and more.New research from Trend Micro brings forward certain exploitable vulnerabilities within these devices andclassifies them as low powered but high risk.40 Our research shows that they are susceptible to denial\-of\-service (DoS) attacks, ACK spoofing, and bit flipping. We also learned that LoRaWaN is subject to manybugs and vulnerabilities, most of which are memory corruptions. In order to highlight the insecurities inthe LoRaWAN communication environment, we created a tool that we call LoRaPWN.41The fact that LoRaWAN devices are often left exposed in remote areas also leaves them vulnerable tohardware attacks like data scraping, accessing external memory, or abusing open interfaces.42 Sensorsacross city blocks and weather nodes in agricultural fields are examples of vulnerable LoRaWAN devicesin remote areas.Lastly, compromised LoRaWAN devices can be used in attacks that could result in stalled operations,leaked data, or falsified information. Since these devices are used in infrastructure and smart city projects,an attack on these could cause physical consequences; for example, compromising a highway\-monitoringsensor could affect motorists by causing an accident or a traffic jam.5G Campus NetworksInournewresearchintocampusnetworks,43welookedintorisksinvolvedinthedevelopmentofa4G5GcampusnetworkforITandoperationaltechnology(OT)expertswhoaretaskedwithrunningandmaintainingfactories,criticalinfrastructures,andothersuchenvironments.Wealsotestedattackscenarios that were rooted from a compromised campus network and the core network within it.For attacks conducted at the IP network, threat actors would first need to gain control over a core networkspotentialentrypoints.Inourresearch,weidentifiedtheseentrypointsastheserverhostingnetworkservices,theVMorthecontainers,thenetworkinfrastructure,andthebasestations.Wehighlightedseveralattacksthatshowhowacompromisedcorenetworkcanalsobeanopeningforthreatsthatalready affect industrial control systems (ICSs), such as DNS hijacking, MQTT hijacking, ModbusTCPhijacking, downloading or resetting unprotected programmable logic controllers (PLCs), remote desktop,and SIM swapping.24 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportOur research also led us to find cellular network\-specific attacks. These attacks emphasize how relyingon Access Point Name (APN), which is used for identifying the gateway between the network of a mobiledevice and another network, is not tantamount to having encryption. For better security when on a publicnetwork, a company should rely on its own VPN in an industrial router, rather than depend solely on itstelecom provider.

Indeed, IoTbotnets are to some degree nearly uncleanable, and a botnet like this might be taken over by anotherthreat actor for them to use.25 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportWe were able to inject an IP address that points back to the sinkhole owned by Shadowserver in order tocheck on the infected devices that are still actively looking for the download server used in the secondstage of the malware operation, and more importantly, to prevent the still\-infected networks from movingto the VPNFilters next stage in the future. Unfortunately, for threats that affect routers, security solutionsand remedies are not that easy. Firmware updates are encouraged, but verifying updates and applyingthem are not as simple as compared with doing so in PC ecosystems. It should also be noted that someusers dont have access to their routers to perform upgrades because their vendor or internet serviceprovider (ISP) provider might be responsible for setting up and updating the machine.26 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportWidely Used and Vulnerable

At first, Microsoft addressed one vulnerability, CVE\-2021\-1675, with a security patch released in June. Afterward, in July, the company released a separate,out\-of\-band security update for PrintNightmare, this time for CVE\-2021\-34527, a critical bug that allowedarbitrary code execution with system privileges. However, a proof\-of\-concept exploit had already beenreleased accidentally online. A successful attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data,as well as create new accounts with full user rights.

For example, we saw instances where the process is named NGINX, which is a valid web server.In reality, however, it is a piece of malware that runs under this name. The second category, which usuallyconsistsofcryptominers,doesnteventrytohideitsmaliciouspurpose;instead,theactorsusewell\-known names of cryptocurrency miners that can be spotted easily. Lastly, in the third category, the entrypoint is just a script for dropping or downloading the malicious file. This is the technique that is currentlymost prevalent because several container image repositories now check against malicious content. Tocircumvent this, the attackers leave a script that is harmless at first look but actually downloads or dropsthe malicious content only on runtime.32 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportTeamTNTAs we mentioned in our section on APTs, TeamTNT is a group with sophisticated tools and techniques.

The script createsa file and then uploads it to a remote web server that is set to receive the stolen files. The web serverwhere the malware uploads its data was actually configured (or misconfigured) to be set as open directory,which allowed us access to all the uploaded files. Alongside stolen data, the server was also a repositoryforLinuxcryptocurrency\-miningtoolsthatthegroupdeploysoninfectedsystems.Wedetectedover4,000 infected instances in total.Furthermore, although the script is meant to run on AWS instances, we found that it ran on any kind ofLinux machine, container, and cloud instance. Based on the timestamps in the file names, we can assumethat the campaign started on February 10, 2021\.In May 2021, we found that TeamTNT was also compromising Kubernetes53 clusters that were at large andusing them to mine cryptocurrency. Kubernetes is an open\-source and widely used system for automatingdeployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. We confirmed that close to 50,000IP addresses were compromised across multiple clusters.In this attack, TeamTNT installs two free, open\-source tools available from GitHub: the network scanningtool Masscan, and the banner\-grabbing, deprecated ZGrab. They also install their IRC bot, and used thefunction kube\_pwn() to run the following commands to:Update the package index of the container.Install the following packages: bash, wget, and curl.Download a shell script called setup\_xmr.sh from TeamTNT C\&C server and save it on the tmp folder.Execute the script to start mining for the Monero cryptocurrency.Several IP addresses were repeatedly exploited during the operation, which occurred between March andMay. The identified ISP list, which had China\- and US\-based providers as the highest list, included somecloud service providers (CSPs). It should be noted that the numbers reflect the likelihood of significantlymore clusters in operation for the US and China than in many other countries.33 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportLinuxApart from the vulnerabilities in the vendors that we listed, we also investigated threats to Linux systems.AlthoughnotaswidelyusedasWindowsormacOS,manylargeorganizations,suchastheNationalAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Department of Defense (DoD), and Google, all useLinux.54 In the following table, we list the top malware families that we found running on Linux servers fromJanuary 1 to June 30, 2021 based on data from Trend Micro Deep Security and Trend Micro CloudOne Workload Security.In compiling this list, we identified and flagged nearly 15 million events fromour sensors.CoinminersWeb shellsRansomwareTrojansOthers

APT groups are working everyangle,fromcomplexexploitstosimplespammail.Ourdataonthreatstooperatingsystems,VPNs,IoTdevices,andothertechnologyshowsthatthethreatlandscapeisvaried,evolving,andpersistent.Considering the different types of malicious threats and the number of active cybercriminal groups, it isvital that organizations establish a robust and multilayered security system. Now more than ever, siloedtools and single layers of protection that only cover parts of the overall infrastructure are not a sufficientdefense against the advanced cybercriminal campaigns being launched.Instead, organizations have to deploy solutions that can assess, protect, detect, respond to, and recoveracross multiple platforms, including emails, endpoints, servers, networks, and cloud workloads. TheseoptimalsecuritysolutionsshouldalsoprovideindicatorsandanalyticsthatgiveITsecurityteamsacomprehensive view of risks to their organizations system without inundating them with mountains ofalerts and unnecessary data.Asalways,ordinaryusers,especiallyemployees,arecriticalpartsofthesecurityposture,astheyareoften used to gain deeper access into organizations. As such, they should be educated on current socialengineering tactics, as staying informed and alert on the latest threats will help close that entry point forattackers.37 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportAs a non\-negotiable practice, patching should be prioritized by organizations, especially since many arestill working remotely and using personal machines, and vulnerabilities in these endpoints could lead tomore serious breaches into corporate systems. Organizations should also prioritize critical system updatesand, if possible, find a way to deliver these updates to users remotely. Virtual patching is a convenientoption to help businesses protect their systems and end\-user machines, as well as to minimize downtimewhile waiting for vendors to roll out official patches.In the first half of 2021, threats closed in from all angles for enterprises and everyday users, emphasizingtheinsatiablenatureofcybercrime.Withmaliciousactorsrelyingonevolvedtechniques,exploitinglegitimate tools, and going as far as targeting the vaccination process against Covid\-19, the need for amultilayered defense strategy that can meet threats from all angles must be reified. In line with the globalattempt to recover from the ongoing health crisis, enterprises must consider all facets of their securityposture, not just to survive in the new work setup brought on by the pandemic but also to thrive beyond it.38 \| Attacks From All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportThe Threat Landscape in ReviewInthefirsthalfof2021,theTrendMicroSmartProtectionNetwork(SPN)infrastructureprotectedusers from more than 40 billion threats consisting of email threats, malicious files, and malicious URLs.40,956,909,973Blocked threats from January 2021 to June 202116,089,334,070535,451,1112,343,479,304Email threats blockedMalicious URLs blockedMalicious les blocked17,226,781,018764,523,0513,997,341,41920B0800M04BQ1Q220,910,330,826848,818,567,862442,384,974,451Email reputation queriesURL reputation queriesFile reputation queries22,075,108,541796,857,859,588517,455,645,61125B01T0600B00Figure 13\.
