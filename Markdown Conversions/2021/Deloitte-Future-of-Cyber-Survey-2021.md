The state of play 
In order to remain competitive, todays enterprises run 
an array of technologies that combine on\-premises 
infrastructure with hybrid information technology (IT) 
and an assortment of third\-party cloud providers. These 
sophisticated integrated environments require new 
forms of management distinct from traditional in\-house 
IT architectures. A clear plurality of the CIOs and CISOs 
we surveyed (41%) acknowledge that transformation 
and gaining visibility across increasingly complex 
hybrid ecosystems is the greatest challenge they face.
In addition to the pressures of the marketplace, the 
pandemic heralds the arrival of remote work as a 
permanent feature of employment. Organizations, large 
and small, have rapidly transformed work environments 
and in doing so dramatically increased their attack 
surfaces, often with little to no time to consider security 
implications. Not surprisingly, theres been an uptick in 
attacks, with 69% of respondents reporting an increase 
or significant increase in threats to their business 
between early 2020 and May 2021this was consistent 
across industries and geographies. 32% of our global 
C\-suite respondents indicated operational disruption 
was the greatest impact, followed by intellectual 
property (IP) theft (22%) and drops in share price (19%).
Today, we find ourselves living the 
reality of a cyber everywhere world where 
digital transformation initiatives continue 
to accelerate amid the emergence of 
a pervasive remote workforce. It often 
appears as if technological innovation and 
the culture it produces are surging ahead 
of our ability to understand, measure and 
respond to exponentially increasing risk. 
Despite the elevated risk environment, digital transformation and 
migration to the cloud continue to be priorities for our clients. More 
than simply improving efficiency, as data flows across organizations 
it drives new ways of value creation, connecting lines of business 
and using customer data to enrich experiences. Our survey data 
underscores this migration94% of CFO respondents indicated 
they are considering moving their financial systems or enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) to the cloud.

When asked, What are the greatest barriers to 
managing cybersecurity across their organizations? 
Respondents ranked data management traversing 
complex perimeters the highest (44%), followed by 
a need for better prioritization of cyber risk across 
the enterprise (31%). Fortunately, its now feasible 
to deploy Zero Trust architecture, which replaces 
simple verification of entities with real\-time access 
decisions based on continuous risk assessment. 
When implemented it is an effective response to 
the dissolution of perimeters in todays ecosystems, 
recognizing that every component in an architecture 
is vulnerable and every layer needs protection. 
Made possible by recent advances in computational 
power, Zero Trusts emergence and adoption point 
to wider cultural shifts in organizations that reveal 
how the role of cyber is changing and its importance 
elevating. More than a technological fix, Zero Trusts 
set of interwoven solutions provide visibility into 
adversarial activity, associated business risk, and insight 
into changes needed to reduce the risk. This insight 
demands coordination between IT and business lines 
as well as enterprise\-wide education and training.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Were in a period of transition 
and rapid evolution. Two 
of the biggest challenges 
businesses face are hybrid IT and 
transformation. Thats creating a 
much more diverse environment 
and driving up complexity. 
Greater visibility, particularly 
into cloud deployments, is the 
number one thing organizations 
are looking for.

EMILY MOSSBURG, DELOITTE 
GLOBAL CYBER LEADERRealigning your defenses
As hackers grow more sophisticated and understand the market 
value of assetswhether its pharmaceutical IP, engineering and 
product patents, customer or other critical dataorganizations 
continue to step up their cyber defense budgets. Almost 75% of 
respondents who had more than $30B in revenue said they will 
spend more than $100M on cybersecurity this year.
The challenge is to ensure this expenditure results in greater visibility into the amplified risk of todays 
increasingly complex ecosystems. Beyond acquiring technology and expertise, it requires organizational 
change to facilitate programmatic governance that extends beyond the enterprise to include partners 
and third\-party providers. 
As technology changes, so does the role of the CISO. Once cyber permeates an enterprise, its imperative to 
reposition where the CISO sits in the organization chart. Beyond simplifying reporting, closer relationships 
to the CEO enhance the CISOs ability to understand business priorities and to have visibility into innovations 
as they occur. This new operational role of the CISO with greater engagement across the organization 
enables the cyber team to ensure necessary requirements, technical solutions and controls can be built 
into innovation initiatives from the ground up. This not only minimizes risk at the outset but risk of overall 
product and service development. 
This deeper cultural impact of cyber is why in this years edition weve expanded the current survey beyond 
leaders with direct oversight for cyber to include those who should be cybers greatest champions: CEOs, 
CFOs, CMOs, CIOs and CISOs. Their sentiments are similar to one another, with variations seen across 
geographies and industries. 
The view to the future 
There is no simple solution, organizational or technological, to gaining visibility into the growing 
complexity of integrated ecosystems that underpin modern business. However, there are a number of 
measures, organizational, cultural and operational, when taken together, that can enable organizations 
to embed cyber in the core of their business initiatives, in their culture and into their continuously 
evolving technology ecosystems.
In this report, we explore some of those measures and underscore the importance of organizations 
ability to gain visibility into the risk which complexity creates now, and into the future as the next wave 
of technological evolution continues to increase our interconnectivity.

The main objective for C\-suite 
and Board members must be 
gaining a full understanding 
of the actual risk that digital 
transformation is exposing their 
companies to, as well as having 
the levers to manage that risk on 
a level playing field with all other 
types of risk.

MATTHEW HOLT, GLOBAL CYBER 
STRATEGY \& TRANSFORMATION 
LEADER, DELOITTE CYBER
Cyber and the challenge 
of transformation
Understanding cyber risk
Because todays cyber threats impact entire businesses, potentially 
crippling operations and rapidly destroying hard\-won reputations, it is vital 
that boards assess cyber risk in terms they can understand. They need to 
be able to compare cyber threats to risks they are experienced at handling. 
Analyzing cyber risk profiles should be as familiar as grasping the health of 
their balance sheet. 
Once they can comprehend the nature and scale of the cyber risks they 
are exposed to, they will know where to invest to best mitigate dangers. 
According to our survey, 41% of respondents indicated cyber maturity 
assessments are used to guide cyber investment decisions, 35% said they 
employ risk quantification tools, and 23% say they rely on the experience of 
the companys cyber leadership. When asked how often they conduct risk 
analysesthreat modeling for new andor existing applications, 37% of CIOs 
and CISOs indicated they do so quarterly, and 29% do so monthly. While 
the responsibility for these assessments typically falls to CIOs and CISOs, 
it is critical the broader set of stakeholders understand the relevance and 
importance of such efforts.
Across every industry, remaining competitive requires new services 
and products be rapidly developed and brought to market.
Much more than simply digitizing existing processes, 
innovative business models are enveloping supply chains 
and creating novel realms of customer experience. 
This transformation also exposes enterprises to new
forms of cyber risk, requiring new cyber strategies 
to protect evolving business models. To manage these 
risks, C\-suite and Board members need to embrace 
the change, create effective governance across lines of 
business, and evolve risk management processes to 
achieve end\-to\-end visibility of all newly connected areas 
of business, including those run by third parties. Success 
depends upon the commitment of senior management, 
their ability to understand cyber risk followed by effective 
investment in security. 
When asked to rank their digital transformation 
initiatives in the next 12 months, survey respondents 
rated data analytics number one (16%), followed by 
cloud (15%) and new or upgraded ERP programs 
(15%) as their top priorities. The addition of the 
operational technologyindustrial control systems 
(OTICS) response option and resulting response 
selection (14% designated this as a top priority) to 
this years survey is indicative of the efforts we are 
seeing across industry to digitize and modernize 
factories and operating technology environments.
The speed and scale of change is truly revolutionary. 
When the world rushed online at the advent of COVID\-19 
this became immediately apparent. Entire business sectors 
were transformed almost instantly as huge sections of the 
workforce suddenly began operating remotely. Fortunately, 
much of the required digital ecosystemfrom cloud and 
shadow IT to ICSwas already in place and ready to scale 
up rapidly. But less obvious are the myriad cyber risks 
underlying this transformation, and few businesses currently 
possess the means to understand and mitigate them to an 
acceptable level.

Building the right cyber team
Its not realistic to expect board 
members or the C\-suite to become 
cybersecurity experts. But its up to the 
board to build a cyber team that gives 
them the visibility they need and to 
provide pertinent information in terms 
they can understand. The key hiring 
decision needs to occur at the board or 
senior management level.

Full speed ahead? 
The pressure to compete at scale very often 
means business leaders digital transformation 
efforts focus on outcomes without fully 
contemplating cyber risks. Beating the 
competition to market creates tunnel vision 
with significant blind spots. 
With cyber permeating everywhere from 
customer touchpoints to intelligent factories 
and the remote devices of employees, the days 
of a siloed IT department managing antivirus 
software and passwords are over. Its no longer 
enough to just keep the network running, 
broader and deeper thinking is required.
Todays CISO now needs the authority to 
influence all the lines of business, gather 
information from across the enterprise and 
be able to communicate directly with the 
board and senior management. Not to mention 
the investment of resources and talent to 
adequately safeguard the organizations most 
strategic priorities and assets. 
This is often a hard sell to the CFO, as what you 
hope to show from a large cyber investment 
is usuallynothing. Meaning, zero cyber 
incidents is money well spent. So how are 
CISOs planning their cyber budgets? In 2019, 
CISOs and CIOs told us that their cyber budget 
was evenly spread across various cyber 
programs. In 2021, this hasnt changedCISO 
and CIO respondents again reported budgets 
are similarly divided. C\-suite leaders should 
understand that to manage cyber risk there is 
not a one and done solution. 
Therefore, cyber budgets are increasing with 
greater attention given to threat intelligence, 
detection and monitoring, cyber transformation 
plus data security. Across the globe, CISOs 
and CIOs are consistently investing in scaled 
cyber solutions infor the cloud; cybertechnical 
resilience; and artificial intelligence (AI)\-driven 
threat assessment and identification, to build 
their organizations cyber defense.

Individualized or intrusive? 
Using personal data ethically
People expect personalized, targeted experiences. We want everything 
from food delivery to travel and healthcare to be frictionless, based on our 
past interactions. What we dont want is the sense were being followed 
everywhere by marketers feeding us an endless diet of coupons for things 
were not interested in. 
How companies manage customer data, connect online and in\-person experiences while protecting privacy can be the 
difference between profit or loss and even long\-term survival. 
Are you able to measure and demonstrate 
compliance with global data privacy regulations?
Privacy by design 
For every customer\-facing project, its important to take 
privacy and security into account at the beginning. Ask yourself, 
how important for our business model is having this degree 
of intimacy with our customers? Carefully think through the type 
of information you need to provide the right level of service. Then 
understand who needs to access it and how it will be stored and 
protected. When we asked Chief Marketing Officers if they were 
able to measure and demonstrate compliance with global data 
privacy regulations, the majority (85%) responded that they could. 
Avoid data bloat
Simply harvesting reams of data in the hope that its useful in 
the future is a drag on resources and likely a recipe for failure. 
Customers resent giving up personal information when they 
dont clearly see a benefit. Collecting and effectively using data 
to create authentic, personalized and human experiences is a 
catalyst for growth. The flip side is the more data you have, the 
more risk you encounter. Its all about balance. When asked, 
the CMOs we polled were evenly split between answering it 
was more important to collect data to personalize customer 
experience versus more important not to collect personal 
data in order to protect against a breach.

In your opinion, how well do you feel your marketing organization 
balances data collection with engendering consumer trust?
Value and trust
Today, people realize their personal data has 
intrinsic value. They see handing it over as an 
investment and want to know what is the return: 
providing personal information should make life 
easier. Like anything of worth, it must also be safe 
and secure. Also, people are demanding agency, 
seeking to choose how and when then their data 
is used. When companies reliably deliver on their 
promises, customer relationships deepen. 
The extent customers trust your company is reflected 
in their behavior. High trust scores correlate closely 
with repeat businesstheir chance of buying again 
rises 540% when they believe companies are reliable. 
Perhaps just as significantly, they will support 
you strongly on social media. As a result, trusted 
businesses greatly outperform the restfor example, 
trusted companies were 2x more resilient during 
the past year
According to our survey, 91% of CMOs stated they 
feel their organizations balance data collection with 
engendering trust either very well or somewhat well. 
Such a high confidence level begs the question, is this 
view shared by other C\-suite members? It certainly 
points to the need for a collaborative approach to 
ensure blind spots arent overlooked. 
Ethics over regulation 
Increasingly, consumers are deploying their 
purchasing power to support companies with 
sustainable environmental policies and are proactive 
on social issues. Their concern also applies to how 
companies use personal data. 
Traditionally, companies have sought guidance from 
regulators about what they should and shouldnt do. 
While compliance with the various laws around the 
globe is vital, its no longer sufficient to just assume 
people are willing to share personal data at all if you 
cannot explain the purpose. Plus, the explanation 
needs to be in plain language and easily understood. 
Regardless of location, companies who bring 
trust into their DNA and clearly communicate 
their willingness to adhere to the privacy rights of 
customers are benefitting from greater faithfulness. 
Making it easy for customers to access, delete or 
move their data should be part of your simple and 
straightforward user agreement. When customers 
see that a company thinks through its data policies 
and can chart its own course, they are more willing 
to put their data onboard.

Into the breach 
Despite taking the greatest precautions, data breaches happen. Its 
wise to consider them an eventuality and be prepared. Getting caught 
flatfooted will make a bad situation worse. How you respond sends clear 
signals about your brand. Not only should you rehearse an incident 
response plan alongside your cyber team testing scenarios around 
a data breach but also collaborate on the recovery plan and related 
communications strategy. 
According to our survey, CMOs indicated that work is being done to fully 
align with the cyber organization with 46% saying they participate in such 
planning and testing once a quarter. Global responses vary with CMOs in 
Argentina, Germany and Australia revealing a higher level of integration 
with cyber teams over other countries.
When a breach does occur, regard it as your obligation to fully inform 
customers about what has occurred. Clearly outline the services you are 
providing in response and think about which channels of communication 
best convey your message: Does it warrant a personal letter from the 
CEO? A gift? Or other compensation? 
Despite the gravity of the circumstances, deftly communicating with your 
customers can also be an opportunity to deepen your relationship with 
them. Handling a difficult situation well by putting the interests of your 
customers first can help your reputation to quickly rebound and inspire 
even greater trust.
Dissolve the silos 
CMOs and experience officers tend to make decisions based on brand and marketing 
requirements and only at the very end check with the CISO if data has been gathered correctly 
(and usually, the answer is, No!). Everyone is on a different team. One team sees their job as 
gathering as much data as they can, the other wants to only gather whats necessary and protect 
it. A better approach is to examine together what is the right balance between capturing the 
information required to deliver a seamless experience and the need to mitigate risk for both 
the company and its customers. Before using data to connect the dots of customer experience, 
organizations need people who can make connections outside of their silos. Its a two\-way street. 
When designing privacy policies and communications, bring in marketing. This is increasingly 
central to brand intentions and messaging, so they can help.

ANDREW RAFLA, US ZERO TRUST 
LEADER, DELOITTE CYBER
In legacy environments, IT resources were contained within clearly defined 
boundaries. Whatever resided externally was untrusted and all internal 
traffic was inherently trusted. And now? We live in a hyper\-connected 
world, where everything is increasingly interconnected. The perimeter 
has essentially dissolved for most modern enterprises. 
72% of survey respondents indicated their organizations experienced between one and 10 cyber incidents and breaches 
in the last year alone. When securing the enterprise, we can no longer inherently trust anything. The challenge today 
becomes, how can you remove inherent trust altogether? Its a revolutionary change to the way we build modern security 
architectures. Fortunately, Zero Trust has the capabilities to meet the task.

be verified against a set of contextual factors to derive a risk\-based 
access decision: 
 
Is the source connection from an authenticated

Is it coming from a known and secure device? 
 
Does this person usually connect from this 
geographic location? 
 
Is the time of connection consistent with the users history?

Enter Zero Trust
Zero Trust is not a technology or a single solution. It is a set of architectural policies that are based on the fundamental 
principle of never trust, always verify. The concept commits to shifting from the traditional perimeter\-based or castle and 
moat approach of managing security, to one where trust is established between individual resources and consumers, as 
and when required. With Zero Trust, trusted connections are established based on internal and external factors, which are 
constantly revalidated.

Step by step
Most companiesknowingly or unknowingly have embarked on a Zero 
Trust trajectory. Their approaches differ by the degree they are tactical, 
architectural or strategically led. While Zero Trust is relevant across all 
industries and sectors, there is no one\-size\-fits\-all solution. Zero Trust is 
a multiyear initiativea transformational change, that breaks down the 
silos between business, IT and the various cyber domains. Any Zero Trust 
journey will face pitfalls and obstacles requiring strong leadership support, 
investment and buy\-in from across your organization to ensure success.
Consideration needs to be given to the business drivers, existing capabilities, 
and use cases relevant to your organization. Its important to keep cyber 
fundamentals in mind: What are you trying to protect? Where do those 
assets reside? Who (identities) and what (devices) should be able to access 
those assets, and under what conditions? To answer these questions, 
organizations need to prioritize IT asset management and data governance 
capabilities to understand the classification and criticality of their assets and 
dataand leverage this context when creating access control policies. Then 
defining your goals and embedding them in your end\-to\-end strategy is the 
surest way to achieve your desired business outcomes. This, however, isnt 
easy. When asked about their biggest challenge in managing cybersecurity 
across their organization, increase of data managementperimeter and 
complexities was the number one hurdle cited by respondents. 
Much more than a technology solution, Zero Trust is a cultural change. The 
change to the overall organization cannot be underestimated. Softer factors 
such as communications, role\-specific training, awareness, and operational 
process adjustments are key elements for success. Overall, such programs 
require a strategy aligned to the business, supported by strong leadership, 
dedicated architecture, technical workstreams and compelling pilots, that 
coalesce the commitment across all stakeholders.
The road ahead
Tech giants are leading the Zero Trust maturity journey and apply these 
principles to develop, run and deliver secure services. Other leading 
organizations are adopting Zero\-Trust strategies to support business 
priorities, digital transformation, and corporate risk strategies. When 
modernizing your own architectures, understanding how the leaders 
innovated and achieved tremendous scale can help drive your digital 
transformation, too. There is no doubt the change is happening. The 
sooner you take charge of your transition to Zero Trust, the safer the 
journey will be. Its far better to be in the drivers seat, determining your 
destinationthe time for Zero Trust is now.
The current situation
Our 2021 survey outlines the challenges of managing cyber risk across the enterprise faced by 
CIOs and CISOs. Their greatest challenges are transformation and Hybrid IT, with cyber hygiene, 
talent limitations and shadow IT not far behind. Those challenges will only get more complex 
through accelerated digital transformations. We must start over and build security architectures 
that can sustain the increasing speed of digital transformation. The time to act is now!

Out of sight. But in touch. 
For small all\-digital organizations, a single view of cyber risk is still
possible. In the short term, for larger entities with complex 
interconnected ecosystems thats no longer a reality. The solution 
is letting each party assume security responsibility and accountability 
for the processes under its purview. When everybody is effectively 
covering their part of the ecosystem making that more secure, overall 
risk reduces, even if there is no holistic view of it. 
The speed with which entities can do that differs based on the type and 
complexity of technologies, but the idea is to effectively cover the basics 
of security and safely share information. Right now, the fix is simple. Over 
the long run, organizations should keep in mind there is a lot to gain in 
efficiency and effectiveness if processes are aligned between areas. The 
sooner that alignment happens, the faster higher security maturity can be 
reached. Both centralized and decentralized models can be effective but 
they should ultimately combine into an integrated single cyber risk view. 
The heart of business 
From a governance standpoint, emerging technology stacks can be very 
complex, but someone needs to own the security agenda. Having board 
recognition and support helps facilitate not only acquiring and managing 
technology but creating the right strategic partnerships. Whats making 
this easier is that unlike traditional IT, emerging technology is closely 
connected to the core business. 
For example, if a manufacturing business experienced a cyberattack on 
its OT, its easy to see how this would quickly become a problem beyond 
the CISO. With production grinding to a halt, the head of operations 
would be immediately concerned, revenue loss would pull in the CFO, 
and CEO, negative publicity would afflict the CMO, and so on. 
Security as an asset 
The mirror image of the above scenario is that emerging technology 
makes the positive impact of cybersecurity more apparent to business 
leaders. If a CEO wants to sell more products building security into them 
makes them more appealing in our increasingly connected world. The 
focus shifts from security as a cost to seeing it in terms of value creation. 
This enables conversations about how reducing downtime leads to 
improved processes. Security, of course, is necessary, and although it 
underpins the discourse, it becomes the secondary argument. 
Growing connectivity 
Traditionally isolated from the Internet, the Operational Technology 
(OT) space has recently experienced waves of ransomware attacks. 
The immediate impact on production has drawn attention to the 
vulnerabilities of connectedness, a situation exacerbated by COVID\-19 as 
more companies have opted to remotely manage plants and equipment. 
Its important to understand that all connected ecosystems, whether 
for medical devices, vehicles, or even entire cities, share similar risk 
characteristics. Medical devices may have been built for old on\-premises 
platforms in hospitals but are now used at home via the Internet. Electric 
carsexpected to rapidly replace fossil fuel\-powered fleets across the 
globeoften require connectivity for enablement. These connected 
vehicles need parts from a slew of geographically dispersed suppliers 
who may not have built security into their components. As cities connect 
more of their services and critical infrastructure, they are partnering with 
numerous third parties from cloud providers to platform owners. In every 
situation the attack surface grows, risks multiply and responsibility blurs.
To simplify a field that can 
encompass an endless array 
of technology, Deloitte Cyber 
focuses on these specific areas: 
Together they cover the vast 
majority of scenarios we 
encounter in our practice.

Whats critical for leadership 
is to bring cyber in at the 
beginning, when youre 
designing change. What data, 
what assets are part of the 
change? What technologies do 
you need to protect them?

Not one size fits all
Cyber consistently ranks in the top three enterprise risks 
across industriesa view shared by those on the Board and 
Executive Committee as well as those tasked with managing 
cyber risk. There is an increased understanding in all industries 
of how IP is vulnerable and customer trust is fragile. 
However, industries lie across a spectrum of digital transformation with varying degrees of 
regulatory maturity around cyber as well as a host of geographical and other considerations. While 
many common themes have emerged during the pandemic, such as supply chain security and 
remote work accelerating the need for Zero Trust, there isnt a single approach to solving the cyber 
challenge applicable to all industries. 
Whatever direction you take, its vital to be aware of some increasingly important areas of interest. 
Many governments are ramping up regulatory efforts to counter widespread cyber threats, making 
cutting\-edge security initiatives imperative. Where regulations arent driving change, the growing 
connectivity and personalization of technology is also forcing ecosystems to be rearchitected on 
secure footings. Finally, the realization that all industries are vulnerable has led to broader efforts 
to share knowledgebeing adaptable and learning what works in other industries will become 
increasingly relevant.
A regulatory explosion
In some industries, cyberattacks have resulted in an outsized regulatory response. In May 2021, the 
ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, the largest supplier of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel on the 
US east coast, precipitated a new executive order and directives for energy companies to improve 
their cybersecurity. 
Across Energy Resources and Industrials (ER\&I) the urgent pressure to upgrade cyber defenses 
exist alongside other longer\-term directives such as the move to decarbonization. With 
compressed timelines2035 the recently revised goal in the USthe transformation of the 
energy landscape will require tremendous digitization to achieve its goals. This includes shifting 
to 5G and deploying an array of connected technologies, which bring their own increased 
demands for cybersecurity. 
Lessons learned from 
the Colonial Pipeline 
ransomware attack
Proactively plan for a crisis. Prepare for technology 
disruption scenarios including cyber incidents:
 
Identify assets critical to your operations which
could appeal as targets
 
Segment your critical systems and OT network
 
Accelerate your adoption of Zero Trust
 
Increase resiliency of your business: Place as much
importance on response efforts as prevention and detection
Go on the offense. Modern security principles such as proactive 
threat hunting, machine learning, and self\-healing systems can 
help you take an offensive approach.

The real headache, whether youre a life sciences 
organization, a large bank, or an energy company, 
is choosing where to focus. Absolute security is an 
unrealistic nirvana. Leadership must make intelligent 
risk\-based decisions on what to protect, and what assets 
are less important. And make these decisions swiftly. 
Then continually re\-assess them as the environments 
inside and outside organizations, 
arent standing still.

Balancing opportunity and risk
In life sciences and health care a new model of direct interaction with patients is 
driving the need for increased cybersecurity. As health care providers seek to monitor 
recipients progress, and life sciences companies focus on patient\-centered services to 
improve health outcomes, using remote devices and apps raises concerns about data 
protection and privacy. 
This monitoring and use of apps allow for the rapid accumulation of aggregate data 
enabling companies to create cloud\-based data lakes to gather insights that can lead 
to improvements in research and development (R\&D), treatments and support, patient 
adherence, and product launches. All these technological advances have cybersecurity 
consequences. Ecosystems need to be designed and built so they protect, encrypt and 
anonymize data plus prevent leakage. 
In general, global Life Sciences companies are more fearful about being hacked than 
they are preoccupied grappling with regulations, which are often inconsistent across 
territories. Establishing then maintaining trust is vital when connecting with their 
customers, and protecting IP is paramount for business. 
Knowledge sharing
The ubiquity of cyber threats and the vulnerabilities that have been exposed during 
the pandemic has had an effect on the way knowledge is shared inside industries. 
While reputational damage remains a side\-effect of attack, sharing information about 
incidents is regarded as valuable and helpful, often perceived as a redemptive step 
helping to repair brand reputations. Enterprises have realized that being secretive 
about cybersecurity doesnt confer competitive advantage but can, in fact, compromise 
their entire sector. 
Governments have acknowledged the importance of collective defense, helping to 
establish publicprivate partnerships for information sharing such as the Information 
Sharing and Analytics Centers (ISACs) in the US. Less formally, CISOs are eager to learn 
from each other. Although its more common for them to connect with peers inside 
their industry, cross\-pollination from more mature industries like financial services and 
oil \& gas to less mature ones such as life sciences and manufacturing is starting to 
occur. Also, CISOs themselves often migrate from one industry to another bringing their 
experience with them. We hope to see more connections and sharing across industry 
and internationally in the near future.

Complexity is here to stay. Hybrid work 
environments are becoming a fixture, 
the cloud is growing in importance to 
almost every type of enterprise and as 
devices and applications evolve they 
are evermore connected.
There is no choice but to gain greater visibility across ecosystems lacking 
clearly defined perimeters. The stakesbe they operational disruption, 
reputational loss or deflated equity valuationsare too high. Just as 
complexity is the problem, the solutions are also far from simple. 
Shift responsibility upwards
The clear takeaway is, organizations that do not incorporate 
cybersecurity into every aspect of their business risk leaving much 
of digital transformations value on the table as well as increase their 
vulnerability to attack. 
Our most important recommendation in this regard is to fully empower 
the CISO. This means directly reporting to the CEO. Just as significantly, 
this move must give the CISO visibility across all lines of business. Its a 
two\-way street. The CISO must provide risk assessments in a manner that 
is comprehensible to the board. But not only does the CISO report up, 
he or she needs to be involved in new business developments from the 
start to ensure proper cyber governance down the line.
Reach across silos 
As technology allows information to flow freely throughout organizations, 
humans must follow suit. Its critical to break down institutional silos and 
get lines of business to collaborate on cyber. Facilitate strategy, product 
development, compliance, IT and marketing sitting down together 
to understand the data assets needed and the security and privacy 
requirements around them at the very beginning of new initiatives. 
Designing with security and privacy in mind is the best way to avoid 
headaches later. 
A clean line of sight
As digital transformation permeates every aspect of 
business, it is increasingly clear that it is both an incredible 
enablerallowing people and processes to achieve new 
possibilitiesas well as a means to amplify and spread 
risk. Conducting our survey at this time, when businesses 
have been forced to respond to an unprecedented global 
challenge, has proven uniquely instructive.

CONCLUSION
CONCLUSION
Implement Zero Trust
Complexity is a reality. Relying on the methods of the past to authenticate users and 
other entities is courting disaster, a situation easily exploited by hackers, often with dire 
impacts. Fortunately, the ability to continuously evaluate risk and apply real\-time review 
to access controls is now something that can be incorporated in complex architectures. 
Zero Trust is as much a cultural innovation as a technological one. Getting people to 
change their behavior requires communication and training. Zero Trust enables secure 
execution of innovation and business strategy; its crucial that everyone realizes the 
ongoing benefits of its deployment in supporting evolving digital transformation. 
Security is an asset
Data is the lifeblood of digital transformation. While its vital to recognize the 
functionality of datahow it drives business outcomes and customer experience
its just as important to appreciate how it creates value over the long run. Companies 
that are associated with exemplary data governance, thoughtful privacy policy and 
robust security earn the trust of customers and business partners alike. Although 
its tempting to think about cybersecurity only as an expense, considering its 
impact on brand and sustaining shareholder value is central in the new world 
of hyperconnectivity. Implementing security is not a project, but a promise to 
carefully handle data, communication and business interaction end\-to\-end.
Sharing knowledge
While there isnt a single simple solution to managing cybersecurity, many of the threats 
facing organizations on the road of digital transformation are shared. With cyberattacks 
becoming more prevalent, no industry or geography is immune from them, but we 
can learn from each other how to effectively handle an incident when one does occur. 
To this end, sharing experiences and knowledge with peers is an essential element of 
improving the security environment all round. 
Risk and reward
Whatever your cyber budget, adopting these approaches will help ensure that your 
resources are used more effectively. 
Its tempting to focus on the complexity and plethora of risks that transformation 
heralds, but its equally important to recognize the upside. When you gain the visibility 
you need, and you experience the agility that hybrid IT brings to your organization, when 
youve earned the trust of your customers and you feel confident with complexity, you 
experience rewards at an entirely new scale.
