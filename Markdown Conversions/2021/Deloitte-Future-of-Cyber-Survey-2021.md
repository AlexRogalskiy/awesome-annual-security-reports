and rapid evolution. Two 
of the biggest challenges 
businesses face are hybrid IT and 
transformation. Thats creating a 
much more diverse environment 
and driving up complexity. 
Greater visibility, particularly 
into cloud deployments, is the 
number one thing organizations 
are looking for. EMILY MOSSBURG, DELOITTEGLOBAL CYBER LEADERRealigning your defensesAs hackers grow more sophisticated and understand the market 
value of assetswhether its pharmaceutical IP, engineering and 
product patents, customer or other critical dataorganizations 
continue to step up their cyber defense budgets. Almost 75% of 
respondents who had more than $30B in revenue said they will 
spend more than $100M on cybersecurity this year.The challenge is to ensure this expenditure results in greater visibility into the amplified risk of todaysincreasingly complex ecosystems. Beyond acquiring technology and expertise, it requires organizationalchange to facilitate programmatic governance that extends beyond the enterprise to include partnersand third\-party providers.As technology changes, so does the role of the CISO. Once cyber permeates an enterprise, its imperative toreposition where the CISO sits in the organization chart. Beyond simplifying reporting, closer relationshipsto the CEO enhance the CISOs ability to understand business priorities and to have visibility into innovationsas they occur. This new operational role of the CISO with greater engagement across the organizationenables the cyber team to ensure necessary requirements, technical solutions and controls can be builtinto innovation initiatives from the ground up. This not only minimizes risk at the outset but risk of overallproduct and service development.This deeper cultural impact of cyber is why in this years edition weve expanded the current survey beyondleaders with direct oversight for cyber to include those who should be cybers greatest champions: CEOs,CFOs, CMOs, CIOs and CISOs. Their sentiments are similar to one another, with variations seen acrossgeographies and industries.The view to the futureThere is no simple solution, organizational or technological, to gaining visibility into the growingcomplexity of integrated ecosystems that underpin modern business. However, there are a number ofmeasures, organizational, cultural and operational, when taken together, that can enable organizationsto embed cyber in the core of their business initiatives, in their culture and into their continuouslyevolving technology ecosystems.In this report, we explore some of those measures and underscore the importance of organizationsability to gain visibility into the risk which complexity creates now, and into the future as the next waveof technological evolution continues to increase our interconnectivity.67DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONDIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONCyber and the challenge

When asked how often they conduct riskanalysesthreat modeling for new andor existing applications, 37% of CIOsand CISOs indicated they do so quarterly, and 29% do so monthly. Whilethe responsibility for these assessments typically falls to CIOs and CISOs,it is critical the broader set of stakeholders understand the relevance andimportance of such efforts.The main objective for C\-suite 
and Board members must be 
gaining a full understanding 
of the actual risk that digital 
transformation is exposing their 
companies to, as well as having 
the levers to manage that risk on 
a level playing field with all other 
types of risk. MATTHEW HOLT, GLOBAL CYBERSTRATEGY \& TRANSFORMATIONLEADER, DELOITTE CYBER9DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONvBuilding the right cyber teamIts not realistic to expect boardmembers or the C\-suite to becomecybersecurity experts. But its up to theboard to build a cyber team that givesthem the visibility they need and toprovide pertinent information in termsthey can understand. The key hiringdecision needs to occur at the board orsenior management level.DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONFull speed ahead?The pressure to compete at scale very oftenmeans business leaders digital transformationefforts focus on outcomes without fullycontemplating cyber risks. Beating thecompetition to market creates tunnel visionwith significant blind spots.With cyber permeating everywhere fromcustomer touchpoints to intelligent factoriesand the remote devices of employees, the daysof a siloed IT department managing antivirussoftware and passwords are over. Its no longerenough to just keep the network running,broader and deeper thinking is required.Todays CISO now needs the authority toinfluence all the lines of business, gatherinformation from across the enterprise andbe able to communicate directly with theboard and senior management. Not to mentionthe investment of resources and talent toadequately safeguard the organizations moststrategic priorities and assets.This is often a hard sell to the CFO, as what youhope to show from a large cyber investmentis usuallynothing. Meaning, zero cyberincidents is money well spent. So how areCISOs planning their cyber budgets? In 2019,CISOs and CIOs told us that their cyber budgetwas evenly spread across various cyberprograms. In 2021, this hasnt changedCISOand CIO respondents again reported budgetsare similarly divided. C\-suite leaders shouldunderstand that to manage cyber risk there isnot a one and done solution.Therefore, cyber budgets are increasing withgreater attention given to threat intelligence,detection and monitoring, cyber transformationplus data security. Across the globe, CISOsand CIOs are consistently investing in scaledcyber solutions infor the cloud; cybertechnicalresilience; and artificial intelligence (AI)\-driventhreat assessment and identification, to buildtheir organizations cyber defense.Organizations cyber budget

It is a set of architectural policies that are based on the fundamentalprinciple of never trust, always verify. The concept commits to shifting from the traditional perimeter\-based or castle andmoat approach of managing security, to one where trust is established between individual resources and consumers, asand when required. With Zero Trust, trusted connections are established based on internal and external factors, which areconstantly revalidated.18Theres a misconception

Any Zero Trustjourney will face pitfalls and obstacles requiring strong leadership support,investment and buy\-in from across your organization to ensure success.Consideration needs to be given to the business drivers, existing capabilities,and use cases relevant to your organization. Its important to keep cyberfundamentals in mind: What are you trying to protect? Where do thoseassets reside? Who (identities) and what (devices) should be able to accessthose assets, and under what conditions? To answer these questions,organizations need to prioritize IT asset management and data governancecapabilities to understand the classification and criticality of their assets anddataand leverage this context when creating access control policies. Thendefining your goals and embedding them in your end\-to\-end strategy is thesurest way to achieve your desired business outcomes. This, however, isnteasy.

CitiesThe heart of businessFrom a governance standpoint, emerging technology stacks can be verycomplex, but someone needs to own the security agenda. Having boardrecognition and support helps facilitate not only acquiring and managingtechnology but creating the right strategic partnerships. Whats makingthis easier is that unlike traditional IT, emerging technology is closelyconnected to the core business.For example, if a manufacturing business experienced a cyberattack onits OT, its easy to see how this would quickly become a problem beyondthe CISO. With production grinding to a halt, the head of operationswould be immediately concerned, revenue loss would pull in the CFO,and CEO, negative publicity would afflict the CMO, and so on.Security as an assetThe mirror image of the above scenario is that emerging technologymakes the positive impact of cybersecurity more apparent to businessleaders. If a CEO wants to sell more products building security into themmakes them more appealing in our increasingly connected world. Thefocus shifts from security as a cost to seeing it in terms of value creation.This enables conversations about how reducing downtime leads toimproved processes. Security, of course, is necessary, and although itunderpins the discourse, it becomes the secondary argument.Despite the general belief

across industriesa view shared by those on the Board and
Executive Committee as well as those tasked with managing
cyber risk. There is an increased understanding in all industries 
of how IP is vulnerable and customer trust is fragile.However, industries lie across a spectrum of digital transformation with varying degrees ofregulatory maturity around cyber as well as a host of geographical and other considerations. Whilemany common themes have emerged during the pandemic, such as supply chain security andremote work accelerating the need for Zero Trust, there isnt a single approach to solving the cyberchallenge applicable to all industries.Whatever direction you take, its vital to be aware of some increasingly important areas of interest.Many governments are ramping up regulatory efforts to counter widespread cyber threats, makingcutting\-edge security initiatives imperative. Where regulations arent driving change, the growingconnectivity and personalization of technology is also forcing ecosystems to be rearchitected onsecure footings. Finally, the realization that all industries are vulnerable has led to broader effortsto share knowledgebeing adaptable and learning what works in other industries will becomeincreasingly relevant.A regulatory explosionIn some industries, cyberattacks have resulted in an outsized regulatory response. In May 2021, theransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, the largest supplier of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel on theUS east coast, precipitated a new executive order and directives for energy companies to improvetheir cybersecurity.Across Energy Resources and Industrials (ER\&I) the urgent pressure to upgrade cyber defensesexist alongside other longer\-term directives such as the move to decarbonization. Withcompressed timelines2035 the recently revised goal in the USthe transformation of theenergy landscape will require tremendous digitization to achieve its goals. This includes shiftingto 5G and deploying an array of connected technologies, which bring their own increaseddemands for cybersecurity.2627INDUSTRY\-CENTRIC CYBERINDUSTRY\-CENTRIC CYBERBalancing opportunity and riskIn life sciences and health care a new model of direct interaction with patients isdriving the need for increased cybersecurity. As health care providers seek to monitorrecipients progress, and life sciences companies focus on patient\-centered services toimprove health outcomes, using remote devices and apps raises concerns about dataprotection and privacy.This monitoring and use of apps allow for the rapid accumulation of aggregate dataenabling companies to create cloud\-based data lakes to gather insights that can leadto improvements in research and development (R\&D), treatments and support, patientadherence, and product launches. All these technological advances have cybersecurityconsequences. Ecosystems need to be designed and built so they protect, encrypt andanonymize data plus prevent leakage.In general, global Life Sciences companies are more fearful about being hacked thanthey are preoccupied grappling with regulations, which are often inconsistent acrossterritories. Establishing then maintaining trust is vital when connecting with theircustomers, and protecting IP is paramount for business.Knowledge sharingThe ubiquity of cyber threats and the vulnerabilities that have been exposed duringthe pandemic has had an effect on the way knowledge is shared inside industries.While reputational damage remains a side\-effect of attack, sharing information aboutincidents is regarded as valuable and helpful, often perceived as a redemptive stephelping to repair brand reputations. Enterprises have realized that being secretiveabout cybersecurity doesnt confer competitive advantage but can, in fact, compromisetheir entire sector.Governments have acknowledged the importance of collective defense, helping toestablish publicprivate partnerships for information sharing such as the InformationSharing and Analytics Centers (ISACs) in the US. Less formally, CISOs are eager to learnfrom each other. Although its more common for them to connect with peers insidetheir industry, cross\-pollination from more mature industries like financial services andoil \& gas to less mature ones such as life sciences and manufacturing is starting tooccur. Also, CISOs themselves often migrate from one industry to another bringing theirexperience with them. We hope to see more connections and sharing across industryand internationally in the near future.The real headache, whether youre a life sciences 
organization, a large bank, or an energy company, 
is choosing where to focus. Absolute security is an 
unrealistic nirvana. Leadership must make intelligent 
risk\-based decisions on what to protect, and what assets 
are less important. And make these decisions swiftly. 
Then continually re\-assess them as the environments 
inside and outside organizations,
arent standing still.28 SIMON OWEN, GLOBAL CLIENTS \& INDUSTRIES LEADER, DELOITTE29CONCLUSIONCONCLUSIONA clean line of sightAs digital transformation permeates every aspect of 
business, it is increasingly clear that it is both an incredible 
enablerallowing people and processes to achieve new 
possibilitiesas well as a means to amplify and spread 
risk. Conducting our survey at this time, when businesses 
have been forced to respond to an unprecedented global 
challenge, has proven uniquely instructive.Complexity is here to stay. Hybrid work 
environments are becoming a fixture,
the cloud is growing in importance to
almost every type of enterprise and as 
devices and applications evolve they
are evermore connected.There is no choice but to gain greater visibility across ecosystems lackingclearly defined perimeters. The stakesbe they operational disruption,reputational loss or deflated equity valuationsare too high. Just ascomplexity is the problem, the solutions are also far from simple.Shift responsibility upwardsThe clear takeaway is, organizations that do not incorporatecybersecurity into every aspect of their business risk leaving muchof digital transformations value on the table as well as increase theirvulnerability to attack.Our most important recommendation in this regard is to fully empowerthe CISO. This means directly reporting to the CEO. Just as significantly,this move must give the CISO visibility across all lines of business. Its atwo\-way street. The CISO must provide risk assessments in a manner thatis comprehensible to the board. But not only does the CISO report up,he or she needs to be involved in new business developments from thestart to ensure proper cyber governance down the line.Reach across silosAs technology allows information to flow freely throughout organizations,humans must follow suit. Its critical to break down institutional silos andget lines of business to collaborate on cyber. Facilitate strategy, productdevelopment, compliance, IT and marketing sitting down togetherto understand the data assets needed and the security and privacyrequirements around them at the very beginning of new initiatives.Designing with security and privacy in mind is the best way to avoidheadaches later.3031wvwCONCLUSIONCONCLUSIONImplement Zero TrustComplexity is a reality. Relying on the methods of the past to authenticate users andother entities is courting disaster, a situation easily exploited by hackers, often with direimpacts. Fortunately, the ability to continuously evaluate risk and apply real\-time reviewto access controls is now something that can be incorporated in complex architectures.Zero Trust is as much a cultural innovation as a technological one. Getting people tochange their behavior requires communication and training. Zero Trust enables secureexecution of innovation and business strategy; its crucial that everyone realizes theongoing benefits of its deployment in supporting evolving digital transformation.Security is an assetData is the lifeblood of digital transformation. While its vital to recognize thefunctionality of datahow it drives business outcomes and customer experienceits just as important to appreciate how it creates value over the long run. Companiesthat are associated with exemplary data governance, thoughtful privacy policy androbust security earn the trust of customers and business partners alike. Althoughits tempting to think about cybersecurity only as an expense, considering itsimpact on brand and sustaining shareholder value is central in the new worldof hyperconnectivity. Implementing security is not a project, but a promise tocarefully handle data, communication and business interaction end\-to\-end.Sharing knowledgeWhile there isnt a single simple solution to managing cybersecurity, many of the threatsfacing organizations on the road of digital transformation are shared. With cyberattacksbecoming more prevalent, no industry or geography is immune from them, but wecan learn from each other how to effectively handle an incident when one does occur.To this end, sharing experiences and knowledge with peers is an essential element ofimproving the security environment all round.Risk and rewardWhatever your cyber budget, adopting these approaches will help ensure that yourresources are used more effectively.Its tempting to focus on the complexity and plethora of risks that transformationheralds, but its equally important to recognize the upside. When you gain the visibilityyou need, and you experience the agility that hybrid IT brings to your organization, whenyouve earned the trust of your customers and you feel confident with complexity, youexperience rewards at an entirely new scale.3233CONTRIBUTORSAuthorsCONTRIBUTORSContactsEmily Mossburg
