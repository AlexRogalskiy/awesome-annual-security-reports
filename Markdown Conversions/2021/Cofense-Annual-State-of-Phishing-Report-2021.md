in 2021319About Cofense323SECTION 1:Executive SummaryIf you think Cofense is a company that promotes 
phishing simulations to build naughty vs. nice lists 
to hand out pink slips for failing a phish test, 
then I recommend abandoning this report now.2020 year in review
In fact, in 2020 Cofense stood alone actively 
discouraging sending COVID\-19 themed 
phishing simulations at the outbreak of the 
pandemic. The peanut gallery of information 
security experts grumbled on Twitter about 
the need for realism. While they were occupied 
retweeting, the Cofense customer community 
produced more REAL coronavirusCOVID\-19 
phishing email indicators than the entirety of the 
global cyber vendor landscape combinedLet that gel for a bit. The inventors 
of phishing simulations blocked 
COVID\-19 themed PhishMe 
templates, yet our customers 
employees reported more real 
COVID\-19 phish than anyone else.A Cofense theme for 2020 was shining a light 
on the phishing tactics that evade secure 
email gateway (SEG) detection. We published 
a stream of SEG bypass samples on our blog 
prompting many organizations to ask for 
help testing their email environments.This report explains how Cofense is in a unique 
position to report on this. In fact, most of this 
report is focused on the REAL phish we see that 
bypassed multiple layers of automation, only to\*as measured by the COVID\-19 Cyber Threat Coalition.be smoked out by real humans who are backed 
by organizations that encourage reporting.What went wrong in 2020
Over 1\.5 million simulated phishing emails leave our 
PhishMe infrastructure every Monday. Unfortunately, 
some non\-Cofense customers did not heed our 
cautionary tale of avoiding certain emotionally 
charged lures. 2020 claimed new CISO victims 
whose awareness programs publicly blew up 
on social media when the promise of a bonus in 
a phishing simulation to an organization cutting 
budget was not well received. 2020 pwned a 
security awareness vendor, too. While they were 
busy creating naughty employee lists for their 
Computer Based Training upsell, it was clear in their 
Incident Response webinar they didnt have a serious 
program in place to triage suspicious email reports.Minimum effective dose
There is a problem in the awareness community 
that Ill write more about in the coming months. It 
boils down to this: Your organization isnt unique, 
and your security awareness program isnt special. 
You need just enough phishing simulations to 
produce enough employee reports to enable your 
operations team to stop a REAL phishing campaign. 
We have published data on how to achieve this 
in previous years that continues to be overlooked 
and replaced with elaborate wastes of time.Unfortunately, when it comes to phishing detection 
and response, Im seeing partial information being4reported to boards that emphasizes the wrong data.
If you are producing reports void of employee reporting 
metrics, you are doing it wrong. Im still seeing 
awareness professionals playing gotcha games with 
individual business units, completely detached from 
how real phishing actually works. Lets not forget 
that organizations are taking these measures based 
on TRAINING data. What other training program 
exists where someone can lose their job for failing?
All is not well in Security Operations Centers either. 
Everyone wants automation to do their job so they 
can be a threat hunter. Much like Homer Simpsons 
self\-driving semi. The good news is, if you stop more 
phishing campaigns in progress, you have fewer 
alerts. This means, you get more time to work on bug 
bounties on the company dimeehhI mean be a 
threat hunter. The fallacy is, if automation worked 
all the time, you wouldnt have an alert queue.of phishing campaigns are credential theft or 
conversational. While malicious attachments 
still play a role in phishing, the frequency of this 
has dramatically declined over the years. In fact, 
most phish attachments these days are not even 
malware, but instead, conduits to open a browser 
to further credential theft. While on the decline, 
we have our finger on the pulse of phishing related 
malware, and we will share that in this report.Thank you for suffering through my ramblings.
Our teams burned the midnight oil organizing this 
data and we appreciate your interest. We have been 
working on this phishing problem for years, and our 
insight is only made possible by servicing a growing 
global population of the largest organizations. 
This report wouldnt be possible without the data, 
and the data wouldnt exist without our amazing 
customers and their employees reporting phishing.Malware is dead. Long live phishing.
We are no longer going to be producing a separate 
malware report like in years past. Instead, malware 
trends will be in this report. The vast majorityAaron Higbee
Co\-Founder \& CTOSetting the stage
While making the shift to a combined report, 
we also decided to take this opportunity to 
shift a few other notable mentions about 
the data. First, the time period covered 
in our research spans the calendar year. 
The next item relates to notifications to 
the user letting them know the security 
technology workedInvoice.docx was 
malicious and removed. While these alerts 
could appear suspicious to the end user, 
technically these messages are informational. 
Lastly, we adjusted how we make industry 
comparisons. Finally, throughout the 
report youll find references to NAICS
North American Industry Classification 
Standard. We settled on this standard to 
align with other major research reports.5SECTION 2:Lets Get Started.
The Phishing Defense Center 
(PDC) TodayAn enterprise customer asked us to manage their 
Cofense Triage application four years ago. This 
one\-off project exploded into the Phishing Defense 
Center (PDC) staffed by a team of expert threat 
analysts, inside five locations across the globe, 
operating 247, processing millions of reported 
emails each year for large enterprises. What started 
out as a way of helping a customer shaped how we 
look at phishing detection and response today.6With Managed Phishing Detection and Response (Managed 
PDR) delivered through the PDC, weve gained even greater 
insight into the phishing threat landscape. In fact, we have a 
larger pool of enterprise phishing threat intelligence data than 
anyone else in the world. Whats even more remarkable is 
getting to see firsthand that well\-conditioned users report real 
phish quickly and that reduces overall risk to an organization.Well say that again:

and procedures (TTPs) 
leveraged by phishing 
attackers range from tried\-
and\-true to innovative. In 
2020, Cofense Intelligence 
tracked several common 
delivery tactics used to 
defeat email gateways and 
other perimeter controls.The threat actor has one goal make it to the inbox. 
From there, the user does the rest.Long\-Standing TTPs
Unfortunately Still Work 
Credential\-stealing campaigns account for over 
50% of phish reported by end users to the PDC. 
These emails have been found in enterprise 
environments with diverse types of phishing 
defense, including SEGs and content filters.Due to their nature, credential phishing campaigns 
are often more successful at evading defense 
technology. Credential phishing pages are 
inexpensive to host, with low upkeep cost, and 
attackers can easily change the infrastructure that 
supports them. Credential phish also leave few 
reliable and consistent indicators of compromise 
(IOCs), making it easier to stay ahead in the cat\-
and\-mouse game of detection. The average lifespan 
of a phishing URL is less than 24 hours, making 
black lists irrelevant and human detection critical.Remember, credentials are high value. They provide 
the keys to the castle for adversaries, sometimes 
allowing for long\-term access to sensitive accountsand information. While threat actors constantly 
develop sophisticated techniques to evade 
SEGs and steal credentials, many still use tried\-
and\-true methods with significant success. 
Data breaches and theft originating from stolen 
credentials are extremely common, giving threat 
actors access to sensitive data, web servers, 
end user accounts, and leave the organizational 
infrastructure vulnerable to other attack types.Over 50%of phish reported by end users to the 
Cofense PDC are credential phish10Layering
The malicious pages threat actors stand up to capture 
credentials live for a very short time, putting Cofense 
in a unique position: we review reported messages 
within 60 minutes of human report. Globally. 247\. 
These messages are quickly investigated and 
processed out to our global network so clients can 
automatically remove them from their mailboxes. One 
tactic we increasingly observed over the past year 
is the use of multi\-stage websites for the user to 
navigate, also known as layering, that leveraged safe 
domains. As email security technology adds to and 
evolves their ability to detect malicious URLs within 
emails, threat actors are exploiting the use of popular 
services. These services are often deemed as safe or 
business critical and are not blocked or restricted.Looking at the example below (Figure 1\), we see 
the progression from the first page as a OneNote 
file hosting a link to the PDF document referenced 
in the email to the recipient or target. Once the 
recipient clicks the link to View Document, they 
are presented with the login page with the option to 
select their email platform. Once they select Sign in 
with Office365, they are prompted with the familiar 
Microsoft login page (of course this is not hosted 
by Microsoft) and once credentials are dropped 
they are handed the expected PDF document. 
However, the recipient is blind to the fact they just 
handed over their credentials to the threat actor.There isnt anything malicious about this page, so any pre\-processing 
of URL protections is not going to flag this as malicious.2413Figure 1 \- Layering11Trusted platform abuse
Phishing threat actors are abusing trusted platforms 
with increasing frequency to deliver malware and 
credential harvesting pages (Figure 2\). Credential 
phishing pages and malicious payloads are often 
hosted on legitimate web hosting or cloud services. 
This means that target recipients receive links that 
appear legitimate and point to trusted sites, often 
relied upon for daily business operations. Malicious 
emails reported directly to the Cofense PDC use 
a variety of such tactics to evade SEGs. Threat 
actors abuse trusted collaboration sites and cloud 
providers like Microsoft (SharePoint, OneDrive, 
O365\), Google (Google Forms), Adobe, and Dropbox 
to deliver credential phish and malware. We also 
see them giving the user options to choose from the 
most commonly used email platforms. The phishing 
emails often contain URLs hosted on legitimate 
domains that maintain a broad consumer base to 
avoid being blocked by content rules and filters.With increased use of 
trusted hosting platforms 
and the threat actors 
ability to leverage these 
well\-known alerts, how 
can organizations better 
protect against phishing? 
Deploy MFA (Multi\-factor 
Authentication) and a 
phishing detection and 
response platform or 
managed service.The most abused 
platforms include:Pick Your Own Webmail 
(multibrand options)Figure 2 \- Example of abusing trusted platforms.12Look\-Back Attacks:
Finding New Ways to Abuse 
Aged\-Out FeaturesIn 2020, CVE\-2017\-11882also known as the 
Equation Editor vulnerabilityand Office macro\-
enabled documents continued to dominate as the 
most popular delivery mechanisms for malware 
in phishing campaigns. CVE\-2017\-11882 is often 
used to download malware like information stealers 
and keyloggers, such as the prevalent Agent Tesla 
Keylogger. Office macros will almost certainly 
continue their prevalence in malware delivery, due 
to their importance in daily business operations.Threat actors also evaded detection by abusing 
overlooked and often forgotten features within 
common software suites. Almost 30 years 
ago, Microsoft released Excel 4\.0\. This version 
was groundbreaking as it introduced macros 
to the Excel platform. While that version was 
depreciated within a year of its release, Microsoft 
has continued to provide backward compatibility 
for 4\.0 macros in all Excel releases since.Attackers have identified this legacy support 
and have capitalized on it as a method to evade 
detection from email security technologies.Another example (Figure 3\) of abusing older 
software features: a string of campaigns beginning 
in early June delivered Java Network Launch 
Protocol (JNLP) files, which allowed Java to load 
and run code files from remote sources. Oracle 
removed support for this feature in late 2018 
with Java 11\.0, but many users still run older 
versions. Despite its simplicity, this delivery 
mechanism evaded multiple SEGs, and was seen 
to deliver TrickBot, Expiro, and Ursnif malware 
targeting users in both English and Italian.Figure 3 \- Example of abusing trusted platforms.13Responses matterOne of the key features 
in Cofense Triage is
getting a response back 
to the user reporting 
the suspicious email.Why is this important? 
Almost 17% of the emails identified as 
malicious were related to a financial 
transaction. Finance teams are under 
extreme pressure to process invoices 
and payments in a timely fashion to 
keep the business running, especially 
during month or quarter end when 
financial reporting is critical. So, if a 
user hasnt heard anything back about 
the email they reported, they will most 
likely interact with that message.Additionally, everyone wants to know 
that what they report matters. If 
there is no response on the status 
(received, analyzed, etc.) users are 
less likely to continue to report and 
the organizational risk increases.A New Delivery Mechanism,
Built to EvadeIn 2020, GuLoader rose as one of the top malware 
delivery mechanisms in phishing, first appearing in 
Q1 and surging during Q2\. GuLoader has been used 
to deliver remote administration tools, keyloggers, 
credential stealers, and other malware phenotypes.While GuLoader is an executable, it is normally 
deployed through weaponized office documents 
that are built to bypass security controls and 
download the malware directly from the victims 
computer system. GuLoaders continued evolution 
of sophisticated delivery and execution techniques 
make it increasingly useful in delivering threats.Advanced Evasion Features 
GuLoader uses advanced techniques at every 
stage of execution to try to evade network, 
email, and host\-based security technology:Email attachment scanning:Obfuscation and encryption hide GuLoaders actual 
functions. Without executing at least a portion of it, 
an antivirus product cannot detect what it does.Dynamic or sandbox analysis:GuLoader contains false code instructions designed 
to thwart analysis tools and a wide array of tricks to 
avoid executing in virtual or sandbox environments.Domain and network controls:Threat actors using GuLoader store their malicious 
payloads on cloud platforms like Google Drive and 
Microsoft OneDrive. Organizations often treat these 
platforms as trusted assets and infrequently subject 
them to comprehensive analysis or blocking.Network\-based scanning:Each malicious payload is encrypted with a key 
unique to its campaign, so neither the cloud services 
nor a network traffic analyzer is able to tell what it is.Endpoint security products:GuLoader can start up legitimate Windows programs 
and inject itself into their memory space, giving the 
malicious payload cover from endpoint analysis.14SECTION 3:The Big Phishing Campaigns 
of 2020Emotet and RyukIf we learned anything from 2020, its that threat actors 
abilities to quickly adjust their methods to world events 
can be lightning fast. From Emotet to Ryuk, and lets 
not forget COVID\-19, Cofense and our Cofense Labs 
and Intelligence teams worked overtime.Last year brought an unprecedented amount of 
disruption, directly leading to an increase in both 
volume and variety of threat activity. Threat actors 
continued to advance their tactics, techniques, and 
procedures to ensure their emails would reach end 
users throughout the year.15Reply\-chain emails solved several 
problems for Emotet in relation 
to their phishing campaigns.Not only did it enable them to increase 
their infection rates dramatically, but 
it also provided them with a large 
repository of emails in many different 
languages from around the world.Figure 4 \- Emotet Reply\-Chain SampleHeres what we saw:EmotetCofense has been tracking the Emotet botnet 
for several years now. This insight has enabled 
us to collect a massive set of data on the 
templates, malicious payloads, tactics, and 
continuous evolution of this pervasive botnet.Emotet has seen multiple iterations over the years 
and has consistently advanced, adapted, and 
been a threat to organizations around the globe. 
The threat actors behind Emotet appear to spend 
a lot of time developing and advancing modules 
and overall functionality for their malware. Most of 
these modules focus on obtaining, stealing, and 
exfiltrating diverse types of data, including local 
and stored credentials, contact lists, and emails. 
Additionally, Emotet has also been known to drop 
multiple types of malware, such as: IcedID, QakBot, 
TrickBot, and Dreambot. In some cases, ransomware 
such as Ryuk and Conti have been deployed.The primary method in which Emotet propagates 
itself is through malicious emails. Once an account 
has been compromised, Emotet scraps the users 
emails and generates contact lists and unique 
phishing templates that are then sent out via the 
same compromised email accounts and systems. 
The tactic of using existing emails and responding 
to them as if it were a continuation of a previous 
conversation is known as a reply\-chain attack.Leveraging this new reply\-chain tactic increased the 
variance and difficulty for detection by email security 
filters and gateways and increased the chance of 
tricking unsuspecting recipients. This provided 
them with a vast amount of capability to expand 
their phishing campaigns with a level of authenticity 
without having to worry about translations or 
common grammatical errors that we often see in 
generic phishing emails. Since the introduction 
of this new tactic, Cofense has also seen them 
begin to extract the attachments of those emails 
as well. This tactic and its use can be confirmed 
by the surge of Emotet phishing campaigns and 
infections that were seen throughout 2020\.Emotet leveraged email attachments and URLs 
within its phishing campaigns. Weaponized 
Office documents were the attachment type 
of choice, and URLs pointed to compromised 
websites or services and often resulted in some 
form of download as well. In the past, these 
Office documents were standardized with little 
variance, and due to that threat defenders were 
able to quickly identify and implement email 
filtering and overall defense measures. However, 
over the past year, Emotet has evolved on this 
front and began employing a technique called 
hash busting, which randomizes the malicious 
payloads just enough so that each has the 
potential of generating a unique hash value. 
Recent attempts to collect and calculate hashes 
on a broad sample set of malicious attachments 
have resulted in tens of thousands of unique 
hashes being seen over short periods of time.As with any botnet, the bots must communicate 
with command\-and\-control infrastructure to 
receive updates and new commandstasks. On any 
given day, there may be over 300 unique command 
and control domains, URLs, or IP addresses that 
are used by the Emotet clients that are installed 
on compromised systems. This list changes 
daily and is geographically dispersed. Most of16these connections function as proxies and 
consist of compromised hosts, websites, and 
domains. As this layer of command and control 
continuously changes with newly compromised 
hosts and accounts, it also acts as a method of 
obfuscation for the actual backend infrastructure.Having users who are 
trained to spot phishing 
attacks, detect reply\-
chain campaigns, and 
report suspicious emails 
can be the difference 
between a secure 
organization and full 
network compromise.A final note on Emotet 
On January 27, 2021, authorities from eightcountries conducted a disruption operation againstEmotet. According to the Europol press release,the actionnamed Operation LadyBirdtargetedhundreds of servers worldwide. Authorities tookover Emotets primary servers, which give updatesto infected computers. They issued an updatethat replaces the list of Emotet command\-and\-control (C2\) servers with a list of C2 serversunder law enforcement control. Ukrainian policealso identified two Emotet operators, fromwhom they seized cash, computers, and otherassociated equipment. Finally, Dutch authoritiesrecovered a trove of data stolen from Emotetvictims, including email addresses, usernames,and passwords. They published a website allowingusers to check whether their email address wasin the compromised data. However, do not countEmotet out yet. Emotet has been so effective thatabandoning it entirely would be highly likely torepresent a lost opportunity for considerable profit.17though other well\-known file hosting platforms have 
been used as well. The Google Docs page will then 
present a convincing image with another embedded 
link. This link is typically to a malicious executable 
hosted on a trusted platform such as Amazon AWS. 
This chain of legitimate services makes it difficult to 
detect and stop these campaigns. Once in place on 
a victims computer, BazarBackdoor uses specialized 
network communications to avoid detection and 
to contact its command and control (C2\) locations. 
Part of these communications involve DNS lookups 
for .bazar domains, which is the reason behind 
its Bazar name. These C2 locations also often 
serve as payload locations. After BazarBackdoor 
contacts its C2 center it will then collect additional 
information which the threat actors can use to deliver 
customized reconnaissance tools, such as Cobalt 
Strike payloads. The threat actors can also choose to 
deliver other payloads such as Ryuk ransomware. The 
deployment of Ryuk ransomware is not automated, 
and therefore will not occur unless the threat actors 
decide the infected environment is a target.Figure 5 \- Ryuk ExampleThe Ryuk Threat: Why 
BazarBackdoor Matters MostOn October 28, 2020, media reports and US 
Government (USG) notifications emerged 
regarding an active credible Ryuk ransomware 
threat targeting the US Healthcare and Public 
Health sector. This was reportedly based on 
chatter observed in an online forum that allegedly 
included members of the group behind Ryuk.Cofense investigated this threat and observed 
increased activity against the healthcare sector. 
Our team assessed with high confidence 
that BazarBackdoor is the primary delivery 
mechanism currently used for Ryuk operations. 
Also, the team identified that similar phishing 
campaigns used to establish a foothold for Ryuk 
infections targeted other sectors as well.What We Learned 
Cofense assessed that Ryuk operators typically 
wait until their preferred delivery mechanism is 
successfully deployed to an intended target prior 
to deploying Ryuk ransomware itself. Up until 
TrickBots disruption, Ryuk was most frequently 
delivered via TrickBot; however, our analysis 
indicated that the group behind Ryuk began 
leveraging BazarBackdoor to establish access 
to target systems in mid\-September 2020\. This 
aligns closely with announcements that US Cyber 
Command had taken action to disrupt TrickBot 
operations. The Cofense team assessed with 
high confidence that BazarBackdoor has been 
Ryuks most predominant loader. BazarBackdoor 
is a stealthy malware downloader that is used 
by the same group as TrickBot. Typically, 
emails designed to appear as internal business 
communications are sent to victims within an 
organization, often with relevant employee names 
or positions. These emails usually contain a link, 
most often to a Google Docs page (See Figure 5\),It became clear that the recent efforts by multiple 
parties to cripple TrickBot seem to have been 
effective in transitioning the Ryuk actors to leveraging 
BazarBackdoor. It is worth noting that there are 
past connections between TrickBot activity and 
Emotet. While there is no direct evidence of current 
Emotet involvement in these campaigns, we cannot 
rule out future delivery of Ryuk via Emotet, given 
historical relationships between TrickBot and Emotet. 
As the TrickBot infrastructure appears to be in the 
process of restructuring, Cofense assesses that 
it may find use again as a delivery mechanism.The Phish
Cofense Intelligence has identified several campaigns, 
targeting multiple sectors, that share strong 
similarities to the phishing emails reportedly used as 
initial attack vectors in Ryuk campaigns, as outlined 
by FireEye. Two subject themes stand out across 
several industry verticals we have confirmed were 
targets of BazarBackdoor. These subjects relate A) 
to employment termination, almost always including 
the word termination, or B) to payroll, almost always 
including the word debit, as shown in Figure 6\. 
While the subjects remain the same, we observed 
two separate download services: via Google Docs 
or Constant Contact. We have included a list that 
highlights the different industries we have confirmed 
were targeted by such campaigns. However, we 
cannot assess whether Ryuk operators intended to 
further infect these targets with Ryuk ransomware. 
This is due to the fact that it appears likely that 
Ryuk operators have cast a wide net for potential 
infection vectors and choose which successful 
footholds to manually interact with and leverage.It is worth noting, these campaigns began 
in mid\-September 2020, which corresponds 
with the timing of coordinated offensive 
operations to disrupt TrickBot.18The sectors Cofense 
has directly observed 
targeted by Ryuk in these 
campaigns include: Consumer Goods Healthcare Mining Energy Insurance Professional Services Financial Services Manufacturing RetailFigure 6 \- Ryuk Example 219SECTION 4:How COVID\-19 Changed 
the Threat LandscapeCOVID\-19 was certainly the source of the most 
disruption in 2020\. During the peak of pandemic\-
themed campaigns, phishing emails predominantly 
delivered credential phishing and Agent Tesla 
keylogger, but threat actors also delivered 
ransomware, keyloggers, remote access Trojans, 
and information stealers.And, while overall phishing volume did not increase, 
numerous phishing campaign themes speak to the 
virus and its impact. Pandemic\-themed campaigns 
picked up steam in February and March, peaking in 
April as much of the world adjusted to the concept 
of a new normal. Following April, as the first 
shudders of the economic impact were felt and 
millions of people shifted to remote work, threat 
actors were quick to pounce.206 Frequent COVID\-related Phishing Themes Pandemic updates and guidance purporting to be from global, federal, or local health organizationsCOVID\-19 office infection datacontact tracingUpdates on remote working changes company news and meeting invites Federal financial relief packages for small or medium business loansTeleconferencing platform invites or required updates related to platforms like Zoom, Teams, WebExFinancial claims related to COVID\-19Cofense has seen sophisticated and novice 
campaigns alike delivered with the above\-mentioned 
themes. Similarly, we observed COVID\-19 themes 
used to deliver different malware families as well 
as credential phish and BECCEO fraud. Though 
campaigns dropped in volume after Aprils peak, 
themes continued to follow the news. In the 
coming months, be on the lookout for contact 
tracing and vaccination\-themed campaigns.Cofense created a Coronavirus 
Info Center so our customers or 
anyone could have one place to 
get the most up\-to\-date information 
about phishing attacks, threat 
actors, and of course, YARA rules.When it came to running PhishMe simulations, 
we quickly pulled our templates with the COVID 
theme once organizations were kicking into 
their business continuity plans to quarantine.See page 22 for key statistics.2119,161unique visitors to

Malware in 2020No matter how much automation drives a phishing 
campaign execution, behind every phishing attack 
is a threat actor. These adversaries understand 
what motivates and moves humans to action. They 
understand the power of social engineering, and how 
to outwit defense technologies and uneducated users.They know that they are in a game of cat\-and\-mouse 
with security researchers, and they find or develop 
new malware and delivery tactics to stay ahead.Threat actors have improved at finding
the sweet spot in social engineering.They are identifying ways to make widespread 
campaigns appear targeted, as highlighted in the 
above overview of Emotet. In May, a credential 
phishing campaign targeted the energy and financial 
sectors using compromised business emails to target 
business contacts. It used analysis obfuscation tactics 
(like random URL text generation or privacy enabled 
domain registration details) to solicit and harvest email 
login credentials. The campaign also used tactics 
to appear legitimate, such as sending emails from 
compromised email addresses, complete with the 
compromised users signature and a theme unique to 
the business.These emails evaded gateways and eased the 
targets sense of caution by containing personal 
information from the compromised business, likely 
coming from a previously trusted contact, and 
by including relevant themes such as COVID\-19 
or important company updates. Initially this 
campaign targeted the oil and gas industry. From 
there it has spread to the financial sector.23Attackers are diversifying the malware used 
in phishing campaigns and finding new 
ways to monetize phishing.In 2020, Cofense Intelligence identified a major 
diversification in malware families prominent in 
phishing. As of August 20, we saw 31 new or 
previously dormant malware families in phishing 
campaigns. Two major newcomers include Mass 
Logger and Avaddon ransomware. Mass Logger is 
routinely updated and modular in capability, while 
Avaddon suggests a return to broadly targeted 
ransomware operations. Increasingly, ransomware 
operators are pairing traditional ransomware with 
malware capable of data theft, then leaking the 
victims data to accelerate ransom payment. Avaddon 
ransomware seems to have joined this trend. Cofense 
Intelligence has seen these campaigns reach the inbox 
in different sectors and in environments protected by 
multiple SEGs.We expect this trend of ransomware 
attackers leaking corporate data 
to force accelerated payment to 
continue, as it increases the pain 
for ransomware victims who may 
otherwise not pay. Organizations 
may be reputationally damaged 
by a data leak and, depending 
on laws and regulations, may be 
subject to fines and penalties. 
Data owners can potentially hold 
the organization liable and pursue 
litigation, exacerbating the cost.24New and Returning

Decreasing Dwell TimeWhen malicious emails reach the inbox, the chance 
of at least one erroneous click remains high. Average 
click rate for credential phishing simulations in PhishMe 
customers in 2020 is 10\.7%meaning that during a 
real attack, almost 11 users out of 100 will likely click 
on the phish, potentially leading to compromise of 
their corporate credentials. The longer a malicious 
email stays in the inbox, the greater the chance of an 
erroneous click.One metric of growing importance is dwell timethe 
elapsed time between an attacker gaining access 
to an environment and when they are detected, and 
the threat mitigated. Dwell time is composed of two 
key metricsmean time to detect (MTTD) and mean 
time to remediate (MTTR). In their 2020 M\-Trends 
report, Mandiant stated that global median dwell 
time is 56 days. Clearly, more work needs to be done. 
For phishing attacks, MTTD can be reduced through 
effective conditioning of end users to identify phishing 
threats and report them.Mean time to remediate (MTTR) 
is currently impacted by:The ability of security teams to effectivelyanalyze todays phishing threats, andThe ability of these same teams to huntfor, and eradicate, all copies of a malicious 
email within their environment26When COVID\-19 appeared 
and more people worked 
from home, We needed to 
respond faster and remove 
emails in fewer steps. 
Patrick Burch 
IT Security Manager, Brasfield \& GorrieRecently, the Cofense Phishing Defense Center 
observed a credential harvesting threat following 
a report by an alert user. The PDC subsequently 
observed the same payload URL in emails reported 
by 11 other organizations over a 7\-day period. In the 
case of one organization impacted by this threat, 
we observed the same payload being reported by 
users 7 days after the threat was first identified. 
Email defenses are either failing to keep up, or 
security teams lack the capability to quickly remove 
threats that are known to exist in user inboxes.Today, commonly used mechanisms such as 
PowerShell are fine for their intended purpose of 
compliance\-based searching, where time is not 
of the essence, but they are woefully inadequate 
for email threat hunting. Search performance 
is constrained by unpredictable environmental 
throttling and by limited options to specify search 
scope. Attackers are quick to exploit these gaps with 
sophisticated threats like polymorphic phishing.These inherent challenges lead to less than optimal 
threat response. For example, here at Cofense we 
are frequently told by our prospects and customers 
that email threat hunting doesnt occur unless a 
significant volume of reports of the same threat are 
received. Why? The age\-old security problem
too much effort and not enough time. When it only 
takes a single compromise to cause major problems, 
email hunting needs to be simplified and fast.27SECTION 7:Stopping Attackers 
with Human Analysis 
and Reporting 
PhishMe in 202028You cant stop human 
attackers without 
human reporting 
and analysis.As with other portions of this report, were making 
a shift in what we cover in this section as it relates 
to phishing simulation training. In previous years, 
we dedicated an entire report focused on training 
metrics. This year, we are sharing the highlights.PhishMe DataSimulationsChart: Type of Simulations by Customers with ReporterCredential29%URL59%Attachment12%10%20%30%40%50%60%2\.73\.42\.8Overall Resiliency RatePDC CustomersTriage Customers 
(excluding PDC)Click to view by Industry NAICS chartBut what about training?
There is a reason we started with the phishing 
threat landscape and left the topic of training 
your users for the end. When it comes to training 
your users on threats leading to a data breach, 
simulating real threats is most effective. Threat 
actors are using real and relevant communications 
that your users regularly engage with are you 
using these for your simulation templates?Weve mentioned the SEG throughout this report 
and it is just as relevant when it comes to training 
your users. Users are busy. In organizations that 
are highly regulated, there is a LOT of pressure 
to check a box for training\-related regulations. 
Business leaders want to know how many 
hours their departments are being kept from 
responding to customers, processing invoices, 
or taking sales appointments while in training; 
or what benefits are being derived from training. 
This is especially true when it comes to phishing 
simulations. While weve highlighted many emails 
that make it to the inbox, there are plenty that 
are stopped by the SEG. Why does this matter?In order to make training relevant 
to your organization and prepare 
your users for the items that are 
most likely to make it to their 
inbox, aligning your phishing 
simulation scenarios to what they 
will most likely experience will 
have a greater impact on your 
organizations overall resiliency 
when it comes to real phishing.292\.7424\.9%The BasicsChart \- 2020 ResiliencyAs we highlighted earlier, Cofense 
customers who subscribe to our 
Managed PDR service delivered 
through our Phishing Defense Center 
have higher resiliency rates. While 
both subscribers to the service 
and customers who manage their 
own solutions show good resiliency 
rates, the Managed PDR customers 
outperform with a resiliency score 
of 3\.4 (compared to 2\.7 for overall 
customers) because Cofense

This is the percentage of users who reported the email without

When it comes to planning a simulation campaign, 
paging through the library of scenario templates 
is a daunting task. To help our Security Awareness 
operators in their planning process, we introduced 
smart suggest, which assists in selecting templates 
that are relevant to their organization. Since 
implementing these suggestions, 30% of organizations 
have adopted the templates to better align with the 
phishing landscape that most realistically aligns with 
what their users would experience.The data related to scenarios is interesting. As you 
can see in the graph on the left, the report rate for the 
three types of scenarios is relatively equal. However, 
the susceptibility rate for scenarios with Attachments 
or Credential requests are significantly higher than 
Click Only scenarios. The report rate is the opposite. 
Click Only scenarios have higher report rates. This 
suggests that the scenarios are effective in training 
users to spot all of the phishing types but especially 
good at spotting the Click Only phish. Accordingly, 
the resiliency against Click Only phish is higher than 
the other two types of scenarios. Moreso, we see 
that 57% of the real reported phish are credential 
phish but only 29% of the simulated scenarios use 
the credential template. What this means is that 
more attention should be given to Attachment 
and Credential phish scenarios going forward. 
Especially considering the impact to an organization 
of a successful Credential phish.How different

customers will often run monthly or multi\-month 
campaigns. Finance is another highly regulated 
industry where we also see many ongoing 
campaigns and the resulting high resiliency rates.AdministrativeAgricultureConstructionEducationEntertainmentFinanceHealthcareInformationManagementManufacturingMiningOther ServicesProfessionalPublicReal EstateRetailTradeTransportationUtilities4\.8%32\.1%6\.659\.2%9\.9%11\.0%9\.0%10\.2%11\.2%10\.3%9\.1%10\.0%9\.7%12\.1%9\.1%7\.5%6\.6%6\.0%6\.6%1\.9719\.5%2\.5723\.7%2\.3225\.6%1\.5115\.4%16\.0%1\.9217\.5%2\.141\.4724\.0%23\.5%2\.0721\.4%4\.5227\.0%2\.5125\.0%1\.7016\.4%3\.0620\.3%2\.0718\.8%2\.6031\.5%3\.9129\.4%4\.1637\.6%5\.8438\.5%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%Susceptibility RateReport RateResiliency RateTraining works.

Model for Learning and Development2 where 70% 
of knowledge comes from job\-related experience, 
20% from interactions with peers or mentors, and 
10% from formal education. The developers of the 
model concluded that hands\-on experience in this 
case phishing simulations is the most beneficialfor employees as it enables them to discover and 
learn and refine their skills. Also, they learn from 
their mistakes and receive immediate feedback 
on their performance. With PhishMe, this holds 
true. Your users want to be able to identify and 
mitigate a potential threat to your organization 
and quickly report. With training, they can.2\. Morgan McCall, Michael M. Lombardo and Robert A. Eichinger, Center for Creative Leadership, a nonprofit educational institution in Greensboro, N.C.31SECTION 8:What We Might
