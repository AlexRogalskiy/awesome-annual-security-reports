Theres no silver bullet solution with cybersecurity, a layered 
defense is the only viable defense. \- James Scott, Senior Fellow 
and co\-founder of ICIT
As security teams continue to search for ways to deter cyberattacks, it becomes more 
obvious that multiple lines of defense are the most sound strategy they can take. As 
business priorities increasingly revolve around engineering output and data privacy, 
multiple testing types integrate more closely with different stages of the Software 
Development Lifecycle and link up to discover vulnerabilities before its too late.
And yet there are issues that routinely slip past teams watchful eyes. As a pentest 
provider, Cobalt witnesses firsthand how vulnerabilities ranging from Low to High severity 
make it to software and systems that handle terabytes of sensitive information. 
We publish our annual State of Pentesting report to shed light on what those 
vulnerabilities are, and identify the trends and hazards that impact the cybersecurity 
community. We collect the data via our proprietary Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) 
platform, which connects security teams with a carefully curated and thoroughly 
vetted community of pentesters to examine their systems and software. 
This year, we looked at data from 1602 pentests performed in 2020 to learn about the assets 
getting tested, the vulnerabilities being discovered, and how that data changes across different 
industries and company sizes. We identified an interesting trend: our customers have been 
struggling with the same top 5 vulnerabilities for 4 years in a row. Despite the fact that they 
are well\-known to the industry, teams struggle to effectively remove and prevent issues 
like Server Security Misconfigurations and Cross\-Site Scripting from their environments. 
To understand why that was, we surveyed 601 companies (not Cobalt customers) to learn 
how they pursue secure development, how they pentest and remediate vulnerabilities, and 
where there is room for process improvements for both internal teams and security vendors. 
What we found was an interesting mixture of pain points, workflow challenges, 
and suggestions on how pentesting can evolve as a layer of defense that can 
help validate the effectiveness of all the other controls that come before it. 
Executive Summary
4
Vulnerabilities
We began the hunt for trends by examining the data from our 
Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform. We looked at the types 
of tests we performed and the types of security issues our 
pentesters found in 2020\. From our sample of 1602 pentests, 
the majority of our customers came to us specifically for Web 
Application testing or Web App and API testingnearly 75% of 
them. The rest of our sample was made up of combinations of 
Mobile, External Network, and Internal Network testing. 
How much risk are
teams managing? 
When we discover vulnerabilities, we rate them according 
to the OWASP methodology, based on their likelihood of 
exploitation and impact if exploited. Likelihood includes the 
level of skill an attacker would need to exploit a vulnerability, 
the availability of documented exploits, and the relative 
ease of exploitation. The Impact includes the effect on the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data or systems, 
as well as potential financial or reputational losses. 
High: Vulnerabilities that introduce the most 
risk of disruption, due to the high impact and 
high likelihood. Cobalt recommends addressing 
vulnerabilities at this level as quickly as possible.
Medium: Vulnerabilities that introduce a 
moderate amount of business risk. These include 
risks with high impact but low likelihood, and 
risks with low impact but high likelihood. Cobalt 
recommends addressing these vulnerabilities to 
improve the overall security posture. 
Low: Vulnerabilities that introduce a 
relatively small amount of risk, but could 
still have some impact or likelihood. Cobalt 
recommends addressing these vulnerabilities 
when there are no higher priority items.

What vulnerability categories are the
most common? 
To get a glimpse of what flaws slip past security teams internal checks, we continue our analysis 
with the top 5 most common vulnerability categories that our pentester community discovered. 
Unsurprisingly, 2020s list reveals vulnerabilities that are also outlined in the OWASP Top 10: 
We have analyzed our data for the 
State of Pentesting report every year 
since 2018, and these vulnerability 
categories have consistently been 
our top 5 for each report. The order 
in which they appear has shifted 
over time, but Server Security 
Misconfigurations have been at the 
top of the list, and by a significant 
margin, every year running. 
This leads us to believe that security teams are struggling to effectively remove and 
prevent issues that are well\-known to the industry. There can be several reasons for this
gaps in secure development, insufficient investment in security awareness and training, 
ineffective remediation, or bugs staying open because of low perceived impact andor 
lack of resources. We explore more anecdotal data on this point under Remediation. 
1\.Server Security Misconfigurations: 28\.1% 
2\.Cross\-Site Scripting: 15\.5% 
3\.Broken Access Control: 14\.7% 
4\.Sensitive Data Exposure: 8\.4% 
5\.Authentication and Sessions: 8% 
Top 5 Most Common Vulnerabilities
High\-risk vulnerabilities were in the minority among our customers, while more than 
half of the Findings we discovered were rated Low. However, we still recommend 
that clients address the Medium\- and Low\-risk vulnerabilities, because an attacker 
could find a way to chain several of those less\-severe findings together to gain 
greater access. We explore this observation in more detail under Remediation. 
Why Three Groups? A lot of pentesting organizations group vulnerabilities differently, 
having a Critical category for the most Likely and most Impactful vulnerabilities, 
and an Informational category for vulnerabilities with a very low risk. Cobalt sticks 
with the High, Medium, and Low categories because labeling one item as Critical 
can make other still\-risky vulnerabilities sound less important, and labeling an 
issue as Informational can make it sound like its not worth fixing.

Looking deeper into our data
This year were diving one level deeper into our analysis by observing the specific 
findings that come up across different methodologies, industries and company sizes. 
Going this granular helps us determine risk more accuratelyfor example, with Cross\-
Site Scripting the risk differs considerably between the Stored and Reflected findings.
But first, a word on taxonomy. Different pentest providersand cybersecurity 
organizations as a wholeuse different terminology and frameworks to describe 
their data. To help readers follow our report, here is an overview of the taxonomy 
we use at Cobalt, which is mostly guided by OWASP best practices:
The building block of our taxonomy are Findings, which are the individual issues our 
testers discover. Findings are then grouped into a vulnerability category. For example:
Finding \#1: An instance of Reflected XSS. 
When an attacker passes script code to the 
server in a user\-editable location within a 
request, the application returns it as part of the 
servers response, which the users browser 
interprets and renders as part of the page.
Finding \#2: An instance of Stored XSS. When 
an attacker passes script code to the server 
in a user\-editable location within a request, 
the application stores it on the server. When 
another user accesses the affected page, 
that users browser interprets and renders 
the stored code as part of the page.
Vulnerability Category: The root cause for both of these findings is that the application is 
vulnerable to Cross\-Site\-Scripting attacks, which happens when the application does not validate 
and encode user\-supplied input properly, so it gets treated as code, rather than as text.
7
With this system in mind, we looked at the top 5 findings from our entire 2020 
database, regardless of vertical or asset type. Heres what we found:
At first glance, the percentages 
might look small, but thats in part 
because of the total number of 
findings we observe in our platform. 
Among 286 possible options that 
are grouped into 23 vulnerability 
categories, these top 5 findings were 
the most commonly discovered and 
represent roughly 30% of our data.
Its interesting to note that 
both of Cross\-Site Scriptings 
variations appeared frequently 
in our pentests. Despite the fact 
that this vulnerability became 
big news over 10 years agoand some parts of the community have gone so far as to 
declare it deadour data and the OWASP Top 10 lists suggest otherwise. And while this 
type of vulnerability is rarely reflected in big breach stories, its impact on both companies 
and their customers is not negligible, risking exposure to highly sensitive information.What are different assets vulnerable to?
While the top 5 overall findings help set the tone for what specific issues security 
teams can focus on, they wont be helpful to every reader. Youll notice that 
many of these findings will relate to web assets, and thats partly because 
the majority of pentests we did in 2020 covered web applications. 
To help readers determine the most prevalent threats to their mobile applications, 
networks, or even combinations of different assets, weve broken the data down 
to the top 3 findings observed from different testing methodologies.

None of these flaws are 0\-day vulnerabilities. All of them have been well\-known to the industry 
for years, which further strengthens our theory that there is an issue with prevention earlier in 
the Software Development Lifecycle. We explore this theme in more detail under Remediation.
What are different industries vulnerable to?
Some industries are under more pressure than others. For example, as the COVID\-19 pandemic 
disrupted the world in 2020, the Healthcare and E\-Learning industries saw an increase in 
cyber attacks. The FBI reported a 30% increase in attacks against E\-Learning targets, and 
many hospitals and vaccine manufacturers became the targets of phishing campaigns.
Based on news stories like these and our pentesting experience, we were interested 
in seeing what the data said on the industries that we pentest most frequently.

\*Study limitation: the majority of this data relates to Web applicationsAPI assets. For a detailed 
breakdown of findings per asset type, please refer to What are different assets vulnerable to? 
While the order varied slightly from industry to industry, it looked like each 
dealt with similar flaws: variations of Cross\-Site Scripting, Insecure Direct 
Object References, and Outdated Software Version. That, however, doesnt 
mean that different industries deal with the same level of risk. 
Consider the following: Many SaaS and Fintech companies completely rely on their 
technology to keep the business running. But larger enterprises in industries like 
Insurance and Healthcare are more likely to have multiple ventures and sources of 
revenue, so the tested technology could only be a small part of the bigger picture. 
Whats more, risk doesnt end with the companys business operations. It 
ultimately translates to impact on end users. For example, weak TLS ciphers in 
a banking app can be critical for both companies and their customers, while the 
same problem in a gardening app can be considerably less exploitative. 
This is also why we want to highlight one concerning trend: industries which are 
more likely to handle financial, health, or other sensitive data such as Healthcare, 
Insurance, and Fintech, are still susceptible to IDOR vulnerabilities. This well\-known 
flaw could allow an attacker to bypass authorization controls and access Personally 
9
Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI). These instances 
are examples of higher risk for both the company and its customers. We recommend 
that companies whose reports list this vulnerability address it as a high priority.
Aside from considering what industries are vulnerable to, its also worth exploring 
metrics that show how vulnerable they are. For example, it would be much 
less alarming if the number of findings per asset was contained to an average 
of 1 or 2, than if companies were observing a number closer to 10\.
In exploring this question, we learned that each industry had room to improve, 
but E\-Learning stood out both with its average number of findings, and 
what proportion of those carried High and Medium levels of risk. 
This could be because many E\-Learning businesses had to respond to surging demand 
for digital solutions during the pandemic. We can easily picture the scenario where 
businesses were pushed to prioritize faster deployments over secure development. 
Security teams likely looked to pentests to compensate for what slipped past 
internal checksone of many examples of how pentests can act as an effective 
layer of defense if teams are able to effectively remediate their findings.

Remediation
Earlier in our report we found that the top 5 most common 
vulnerability categories in our database have stayed the same 
every year since 2018\. When we consult other sources, such as 
the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities report, this problem goes back 
even further. For example, Cross\-Site Scripting and Broken Access 
Control have made the list in each iteration since 2003\. Security 
Misconfigurations have also been a prevalent entry, dropping out 
of the list in 2007 only to reappear in later releases.
This observation raises the inevitable question: why is the industry 
struggling with the same well\-known problems for so long?
To answer this, we wanted to better understand how security practitioners both 
prevent vulnerabilities and remediate what their pentests discover. We wanted to 
know if there were any internal issues that limited teams to higher priority items, but 
also if there were external factors that were coming from their pentest providers. 
In Q1 of this year, we spoke to 601 IT security professionals across the United States, 
Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, all of whom worked for companies with 500 or more 
employees. They were generally familiar with pentesting, and had previously used pentesting 
at their companies. More information on our methodology is included in Appendix B. 
To start, respondents identified and fixed 54 vulnerabilities on average 
in the last calendar year. And yet 6 out of 10 said they saw these same 
issues re\-emerge at a later date. Why? We have a few theories.Theory \#1: Detecting vulnerabilities before code 
goes live is still a work in progress. 
Before we dive into pentesting\-related theories, we want to look at the 
bigger picture and understand why preventable issues slip past initial 
checks and only come up after a third party tests for them.
Results: Nearly all respondents (96%) agreed that they have to follow 
secure development principles to prevent vulnerabilities from re\-emerging. 
We wanted to know how they work towards achieving that:
12
Following secure development principles doesnt always mean that each of these points 
needs to be at 100%. Of the 43% who dont use code reviews, for example, some might not 
be using it as diligently as they need to, while others might not need it in the first place. But 
the fact stands that vulnerabilities slip past these checks, as evidenced by our own data. 
What this graph can tell us is that security teams are using a combination of measures to prevent 
vulnerabilities early on, which is something we strongly support. It takes multiple approaches to 
secure ones environment. Pentesting isnt the panacea of application security, but it can validate 
all the other pieces of a security program and help inform what areas need to be improved.

Theory \#2: Teams struggle to detect everything 
that slips past internal checks because they 
cant pentest their entire application portfolio. 
In addition to this theory, we also wanted to see if there were other 
challenges, for example with procurement and setup.
Results: Even though 78% of study participants agree that pentesting is a high\-priority 
item for their security teams, respondents only conduct pentesting on 63% of their overall 
application portfolio on average. What challenges could be causing this disconnect?

Talent Matching: 86% of respondents agreed that 
it is difficult to find andor hire people with the 
right skill sets for pentesting. 
Expense: 58% of our panelists believe that 
pentesting is too expensive, with 42% going so 
far as to say their company does not have the 
budget to cover it. 
Scoping Difficulties: 61% said that pentesting is 
difficult to scope. 
Timing: Over half of the security professionals we 
interviewed agreed that pentesting is too slow to 
schedule. How slow, exactly? Only 22% said they 
are able to get pentesting scheduled within days; 
most have to wait weeks (55%) and some even 
divulged that it takes their organization months 
(22%) to get a pentest project off the ground. 
Percentage of respondents who agree with the listed statements
14
Aside from limiting how much teams can pentest, these pain points also lead to longer 
periods of time between new code being pushed, and pentests revealing where it is vulnerable. 
That can translate to months of exposure that no one is aware of and can mitigate. 
None of these setbacks are connected to how engineering and security teams 
work together. Instead, they are symptoms of a wider problem: the established 
pentesting procurement process makes this security control less accessible, and 
therefore less reliable. To enable security teams, pentests need to be available with 
appropriate talent on\-demand, with simpler setup and more flexible pricing. 
Theory \#3: Teams might be taking too long to 
address Medium\- or Low\-risk findings.
Results: Nearly all (93%) of respondents reported that 
their business solves critical vulnerabilities quickly. 
The response to Low\- or Medium\-risk vulnerabilities 
was more sluggish, with two\-thirds of our respondents 
agreeing that it took their team longer to respond to 
these issues than it did to address High\-risk attack 
points. Over half (51%) confessed that their companies 
were too slow in responding to these lower\-risk issues, 
and 67% feel that this practice creates significant risk 
to business, considering that these supposedly low\-
urgency vulnerabilities can chain together and escalate 
into very serious problems. To minimize risk and prevent 
chained exploits, 79% of our study participants agreed 
that their organizations need to focus just as much 
on Low or Medium vulnerabilities as they do High. 
However, 25% of respondents reported that their 
company takes up to 60 daysor longerto 
address LowMedium\-risk vulnerabilities, and a 
small but nonetheless surprising segment (1%) of 
companies dont bother to remediate them at all.

Why is this such poor practice? For a case study on the potentially disastrous consequences of 
postponing so\-called low\-urgency remediation, look no further than the 2017 Equifax breach. 
This breach exposed the personal information of 148 million peoplemore than 40% of the 
population of the United States at the timeand resulted in a record\-shattering $700 million 
FTC settlement, their CEO stepping down amid massive public controversy, and $1\.4 billion 
spent cleaning up the mess. So how did this catastrophic breach occur? It happened because 
of a widely\-known software vulnerability for which a patch was made availablea patch that 
Equifax, due to oversight in their internal processes, failed to deploy. Cobalts Chief Strategy 
Officer Caroline Wong breaks it down: This was not a crazy technical problem that lacked a 
solution. The technical solution was available; this was a lack of people and process innovation. 
Theory \#4: Remediation teams could be limited 
to critical findings because of workflow issues.Results: There is definite room for improvement here. Security and engineering teams still 
have work to do to effectively collaborate, on remediation priorities and more generally. The 
outcome is lower\-risk findings staying exposed for longer and coming up again at a later test.What is holding them back? Largely, 
the answers are inefficient workflows 
and lack of automation integrations.
A majority of security respondents 
agreed that they can collaborate 
better with their engineering 
colleaguesmuch better, in some 
cases. Half of our respondents 
reported that the relationship 
between security and engineering 
teams within their company 
was strong, but with room for 
improvement; 18% said the relationship between these teams was neutral, in that 
their teams occasionally worked together, but not as often as they should; and 2% 
of respondents called this relationship poor, reporting that their team rarely worked 
together with engineers at their company. Only 3 in 10 respondents were able to happily 
report that their companys security and engineering teams were intertwined.
So what are the biggest challenges teams need to address in order to improve DevSecOps 
workflows? We posed this question to our respondents and here is what they had to say: 
How would you describe the current relationship 
between the security and engineering teams within 
your organization?
16
Lets focus on manual processes and AppSec tool integrations, particularly 
around remediating pentest findings. Once security teams have pentest findings 
in hand, how are they sending them over to their colleagues in engineering?
Nearly three\-quarters of respondents said that this was handled manually within their 
organizationeither the findings were manually pushed to issue tracking software (39%) or 
worse, the engineering team was manually sent a PDF shared by the pentest provider (34%). 
Perhaps then it is not surprising that when there was misalignment with remediation priorities, 
half our respondents said that their engineering teams blamed workflow inefficiencies. 
Why is this important? 
Most of the time the engineering 
team also makes up the remediation 
teamand asking them to address 
Low\- and Medium\-risk findings with 
the same urgency as highly critical 
ones is a big request when you factor 
in their commitments to roadmap 
execution, business enablement, and 
customer satisfaction. Clearly, security 
teams cannot pile requests onto these 
teams unless they explore ways to free up their time with more efficient and automated 
processes. For example, engineering is not involved in pentesting setup or execution and 
they rarely have a say in how findings are packaged and shared with themthese are all 
handled by the security team. Therefore, the responsibility lies with the latter to improve 
this workflow in order to push toward DevSecOps and remediate more effectively.

Conclusion
Our data strongly suggests that security teams are still struggling with the same well\-known 
vulnerabilities that have plagued the industry for years. Flaws like Cross\-Site Scripting and 
Broken Access Control, which were among the top 5 vulnerabilities in our 2020 data, have 
also been listed as a prevalent security issue in the OWASP Top 10 every year since 2003\. 
As much as teams aim for secure development, we conclude there are still 
gaps in prevention and remediation. As to what might be causing them, 
and where pentesting plays a part, we discovered the following:
1\. The majority of teams pursue some form of secure 
development, but they dont catch everything. Pentesting 
is still a valuable and effective layer of defense. 
1\. To empower security teams to test new code earlier, 
pentesting needs to be faster and easier to set up, and 
more financially accessible.
1\. Ignoring or delaying remediation for Medium\- and Low\-risk 
pentest findings can escalate into a larger issue that is 
more costly to fix. 
1\. What holds remediation teams back with fixing pentest 
findings are too many manual tasks and a lack of tool 
integrations.
18
For the final point, we tested a few innovation ideas with our survey respondents to learn 
what they felt is the best way to improve workflows and get more done with less. The 
most popular was real\-time delivery of findings instead of a PDF report (57%), closely 
followed by choosing a provider that offers software integrations that automatically 
share information and status updates between both teams dashboards (56%). Half 
our respondents wanted to see API integrations that allow for data consolidation 
and visualization, and an honorable mention went to dedicated communication 
channels for security, engineering, and pentesters to collaborate (37%). 
These very innovations and more are what define the movement toward Pentest as a Service 
(PtaaS). Cobalts Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform, coupled with an exclusive community of 
testers, delivers the real\-time insights you need to remediate risk quickly and innovate securely.

Appendix A: How to fix and prevent 
the most common vulnerabilities
The following chart contains information about the 13 vulnerabilities we mentioned across this report. It includes 
a short summary of the Finding, and broad advice for ensuring that your assets are protected against them. 
We draw these recommendations from the expertise of our security researchers and pentesters, and 
from established cybersecurity communities best practices, such as the OWASPs Cheat Sheet Series 
and the SANS CIS Controls. The guidance in this report is also documented in our platform.
Due to the way a website or application handles resources, one 
customers file has an ID in the URL, for example file123, 
which corresponds to that files location in the database.
An attacker who can access file124 changes the resource ID 
number to a different number, such as file123 and can view 
the other customers file, or anything else in the database.
A web form has a field on it that accepts user text input, 
then stores that input somewhere on the servers database. 
For example, a name field on a social media site.
An attacker accesses that web form, and enters a line of 
code, which the server accepts and stores in the database. 
The next time a user pulls up data that includes the attackers 
input (such as accessing the attackers social media profile), 
their browser attempts to run whatever code they entered.
1\.Use per\-user or per\-session indirect object references. 
For example, instead of using the resources database 
key, a drop\-down list of six resources authorized 
for the current user could use the numbers 1 to 
6 to indicate which value the user selected. The 
application has to map the per\-user indirect reference 
back to the actual database key on the server.
2\.Check access, and ensure that each use of a 
direct object reference from an untrusted source 
includes an access control check to ensure the 
user is authorized for the requested object. 
1\.Treat all user input as untrusted data. 
2\.Never insert untrusted data except in allowed locations.
3\.Always input\- or output\-encode any data that 
comes into or out of the application. 
4\.Create a whitelist of allowed characters. 
5\.Use a well\-known and secure encoding API for input 
and output encoding, such as the OWASP ESAPI. 
6\.Never try to write input and output encoders 
unless absolutely necessary. Research 
and use an existing output encoder.

Stored Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS)

A website passes a piece of information in a 
URL or other user\-editable location, which the 
server reflects back when that URL is sent.
An attacker creates a URL that contains a string of 
code in that parameter in the URL. When they reload 
the page on their own system, or send that URL to 
another user, the browser accepts that code string and 
performs whatever actions the string describes.
Note: While Stored and Reflected XSS attacks 
function differently, the methods for remediating 
them follow the same design principles.
A piece of software that runs a website, server, 
network, or individual computers does not have 
the latest security patches installed.
An attacker could search databases of documented 
vulnerabilities to find information about exploiting 
one of these outdated pieces of software.
A login portal or forgotten password interface, or similar 
web feature, prompts users to enter their username or email 
address. When a user enters a valid response, the server 
displays a message saying its valid (such as We are sending 
a password reset email). When they enter an invalid response, 
the server displays a different message (like, user not found). 
An attacker can use different responses to determine 
what items on a list of potential usernames and email 
addresses are valid. This could be a list of identified users 
from past breaches, or guesses based on common first 
and last names in Census data. The attacker can then 
use their list of legitimate usernames to attack users.
1\.Treat all user input as untrusted data. 
2\.Never insert untrusted data except in allowed locations.
3\.Always input\- or output\-encode any data that 
comes into or out of the application. 
4\.Create a whitelist of allowed characters. 
5\.Use a well\-known and secure encoding API for input 
and output encoding, such as the OWASP ESAPI. 
6\.Never try to write input and output encoders 
unless absolutely necessary. Research 
and use an existing output encoder.
Keep all software up\-to\-date, especially if a known vulnerability 
or weakness associated with an older version exists.
It may also be worth considering a vulnerability scanner, 
which can report software that has gone out\-of\-date, 
and any documented vulnerabilities related to it.
Note: For more information about patches and 
updates to specific software and hardware in your 
environment, contact the relevant vendors.
Ensure that the application does not reveal existing 
user names or any data associated with them, whether 
because of a misconfiguration or a design decision.

When a user accesses a website or application, and 
the server then serves them the requested information, 
it sends some information in an HTTP header. A lot of 
these headers instruct the browser how to interact with 
the website without rendering in the users window. 
Some of these headers can prevent other types of attacks, such 
as Clickjacking, XSS, and encryption\-related downgrade attacks
When a web application sends sensitive information 
(passwords, credit card details, Social Security Numbers, 
or other types of PII, for example) it should send this 
information encrypted. Meaning that it uses complex 
ciphers to make that data unreadable to anyone other than 
the intended recipient, and uses secure Transport Layer 
Security (TLS) protocols to send that information securely. 
However, some of these transport protocols have 
become outdated, meaning it is possible for an attacker 
to break into older secure communication channels 
and decrypt the information. Some configurations also 
allow an attacker to downgrade a communication from 
a stronger cipher suite to one that they can crack. 
Ensure that all HTTP servers implement the following 
recommended security headers, at minimum: 
 
HTTP Strict Transport Security
 
X\-Frame\-Options
 
X\-Content\-Type\-Options
 
Content\-Security\-Policy
 
X\-Permitted\-Cross\-Domain\-Policies 
Cross\-Origin\-Resource\-Policy
For more information on these and other headers that your 
servers may need, see the OWASP Secure Headers Project.
Use only the most up\-to\-date TLS protocols. Configure 
your servers to accept only TLS version 1\.2 or higher. Do 
not accept any Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) versions.

Related to the Insecure TLS detailed above, an Insecure 
Cipher Suite refers to the method by which secured data 
is encrypted. Ciphers are the secret codes used to encrypt 
information and make it impossible to read without knowing 
the cipher itself. The goal is to ensure that people other 
than the intended recipient cant decode the message.
However, some suites of ciphers are old enough 
that they have been broken, and can be reliably 
translated back into the original text.
Create a shortlist of cipher suites that your 
servers accept, and use only those. 
Select only cipher suites that offer 128\-bit encryption.

When a mobile device has been jailbroken, someone has 
installed a custom version of the Operating System on the 
device that gives them higher levels of user permissions 
than the out\-of\-the\-box version. This is sometimes called 
rooting when it gives the user root access to their device.
Certificate pinning is the process of associating a backend 
server with a specific X.509 certificate or public key instead 
of accepting any certificate signed by a trusted Certificate 
Authority. After storing, or pinning, the server certificate 
or public key, the mobile app will only connect to the known 
server only. This instructs the application not to trust external 
Certificate Authorities, which reduces the attack surface.
Implement mechanisms to detect whether the application is 
running on a jailbroken or rooted mobile Operating System. 
This blocks some of the tools and techniques reverse 
engineers like to use. Like most other types of defense, 
jailbreak detection is not very effective by itself, but scattering 
checks throughout the apps source code can improve 
the effectiveness of the overall anti\-tampering scheme.
Pin and hard\-code the certificate into the application.

How to fix it:
A vulnerable application stores cleartext sensitive information 
(such as usernames and passwords, PII, credit card data, 
or SSNs, depending on the application) within a resource 
that a user with the correct permissions could access. 
Even if the information is encoded and not human\-readable, 
an attacker could use various techniques to determine which 
encoding is being used, then decode the information.
Configure the application to store any sensitive 
information in an encrypted format and resource.
OWASP also recommends performing threat modelling on your 
application, to determine how it handles the following features: 
 
URL caching (requests and responses)
 
Keyboard input cache
 
CopyPaste buffer cache
 
Backgrounded application 
 
Intermediate data
 
Logging 
 
Stored HTML5 data 
 
Browser cookie objects
 
Third\-party analytics data

For some server use\-cases, a piece of software 
may require input from a remote user to locate 
and perform its intended function. For example, 
user\-supplied terms for a database search. 
If an attacker supplies a line of code that the server 
recognizes as a command, a vulnerable server may 
execute that code and perform an unexpected function. 
By executing the command, the server or application 
could give an attacker a privilege or capability 
that the attacker would not otherwise have.
Command injection can be an issue with wrapper programs.
The most effective method of eliminating Code Injection 
vulnerabilities is to avoid allowing software to evaluate 
code unless absolutely and explicitly necessary. 
However, if there is no way to achieve the same 
result without code evaluation, ensure that any user 
input is validated very strongly, placing as many 
restrictions as possible on that user input.
Server\-Side Injection: Remote Code Execution
What is it:
How to fix it:
When an application, Operating System, networked 
device, or other piece of software is installed, it 
may include pre\-configured login credentials for an 
Administrative panel, or it may create this account 
with a generated password during set\-up. This Admin 
username and password may be written in some published 
documentation, or it may be available on the Internet. 
If this password is predictable, no one changes it on 
the first access, an attacker could look up the password 
and gain unauthorized access to the application. 
1\.Never use default credentials as it is trivial 
for an attacker to gain access by providing 
known or easy to guess credentials.
2\.Always change any kind of default credentials as the 
first step of setting up any kind of environment.
3\.Ensure that all passwords meet or exceed 
proper password strength requirements. Cobalt 
recommends at least 12 characters, with complex 
characters (symbols, capital letters, numbers). 
Longer passwords are more difficult to crack.
4\.If possible, consider disabling external access 
for systems with Administrative features.
Server Security Misconfiguration: Using Default Credentials
While the fixes listed above should improve the security posture of your application and environments, 
Cobalt still recommends pentesting on at least an annual basis. This report is not a substitute for a 
pentest. Our database contains well over 100 vulnerabilities, and we have mentioned just a handful 
in this report. Regular pentesting can catch additional flaws beyond those we mention here, and 
can find new ones that may get added as you make changes to your systems. You can also learn 
about these and other vulnerabilities on the OWASP
, SANS CIS Controls, and CVE websites.

Appendix B: Methodology
Cobalts State of Pentesting report includes two types of data sets: 
Anonymized pentest data collected via Cobalts proprietary Pentest as a Service platform (referred to later 
as Cobalts Pentest Data);
Survey responses on questions related to pentest procurement, setup, delivery and following remediation 
(referred to later as Survey Collection)
Cobalts Pentest Data Methodology
The data used in this report represents all pentests executed via Cobalts Pentest as a Service 
platform from January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020\. Cobalt delivers third\-party pentest services 
via the Cobalt platform with the help of a highly curated and collaborative pentest community.
The reported data includes information on the types of assets that were tested and their discovered 
vulnerabilities, which are broken down to vulnerability categories and associated findings. This accounts for 
a total of 1602 pentests. The data represents large and small companies, a variety of industries ranging from 
SaaS to Insurance and Fintech, and 4 geographic regions: EMEA, APAC, North America and South America.
One limitation of this study is the high concentration of pentests commissioned for Web applications 
and APIs. Combined, these represent roughly 74% of all discovered findings, which is driven entirely 
by customers decisions on what to have pentested. Despite the unequal distribution across asset 
types, categories like Mobile applications and Internal and External networks still had enough 
statistically significant data to allow the authors to identify prevalent vulnerabilities for each.Survey Collection
To explore questions raised in the first half of the report, the authors commissioned an additional survey into 
how security practitioners procure and manage pentests, and how they remediate discovered vulnerabilities. The 
survey collected responses from 601 security professionals who work for companies with 500\+ employees and 
live and work either in the United States, or in the DACH region (Germany, Austria and Switzerland). To qualify, 
respondents had to have a general familiarity with and history of using pentesting throughout their careers.
