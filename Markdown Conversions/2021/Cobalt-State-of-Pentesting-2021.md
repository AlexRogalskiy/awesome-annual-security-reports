Jay Paz and Robert KuglerExecutive SummaryTheres no silver bullet solution with cybersecurity, a layered 
defense is the only viable defense. \- James Scott, Senior Fellow 
and co\-founder of ICITAs security teams continue to search for ways to deter cyberattacks, it becomes moreobvious that multiple lines of defense are the most sound strategy they can take. Asbusiness priorities increasingly revolve around engineering output and data privacy,multiple testing types integrate more closely with different stages of the SoftwareDevelopment Lifecycle and link up to discover vulnerabilities before its too late.And yet there are issues that routinely slip past teams watchful eyes. As a pentestprovider, Cobalt witnesses firsthand how vulnerabilities ranging from Low to High severitymake it to software and systems that handle terabytes of sensitive information.We publish our annual State of Pentesting report to shed light on what thosevulnerabilities are, and identify the trends and hazards that impact the cybersecuritycommunity. We collect the data via our proprietary Pentest as a Service (PtaaS)platform, which connects security teams with a carefully curated and thoroughlyvetted community of pentesters to examine their systems and software.This year, we looked at data from 1602 pentests performed in 2020 to learn about the assetsgetting tested, the vulnerabilities being discovered, and how that data changes across differentindustries and company sizes. We identified an interesting trend: our customers have beenstruggling with the same top 5 vulnerabilities for 4 years in a row. Despite the fact that theyare well\-known to the industry, teams struggle to effectively remove and prevent issueslike Server Security Misconfigurations and Cross\-Site Scripting from their environments.To understand why that was, we surveyed 601 companies (not Cobalt customers) to learnhow they pursue secure development, how they pentest and remediate vulnerabilities, andwhere there is room for process improvements for both internal teams and security vendors.What we found was an interesting mixture of pain points, workflow challenges,and suggestions on how pentesting can evolve as a layer of defense that canhelp validate the effectiveness of all the other controls that come before it.VulnerabilitiesWe began the hunt for trends by examining the data from our 
Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform. We looked at the types 
of tests we performed and the types of security issues our 
pentesters found in 2020\. From our sample of 1602 pentests, 
the majority of our customers came to us specifically for Web 
Application testing or Web App and API testingnearly 75% of 
them. The rest of our sample was made up of combinations of 
Mobile, External Network, and Internal Network testing.How much risk are
teams managing? 
When we discover vulnerabilities, we rate them accordingto the OWASP methodology, based on their likelihood ofexploitation and impact if exploited. Likelihood includes theVULNERABILITY RISK RATINGlevel of skill an attacker would need to exploit a vulnerability,High: Vulnerabilities that introduce the mostthe availability of documented exploits, and the relativerisk of disruption, due to the high impact andease of exploitation. The Impact includes the effect on thehigh likelihood. Cobalt recommends addressingconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of data or systems,vulnerabilities at this level as quickly as possible.as well as potential financial or reputational losses.LowLow

Cobaltrecommends addressing these vulnerabilitieswhen there are no higher priority items.Medium
Medium
31\.0%31\.0%HighHigh
15\.4%15\.4%4High\-risk vulnerabilities were in the minority among our customers, while more thanhalf of the Findings we discovered were rated Low. However, we still recommendthat clients address the Medium\- and Low\-risk vulnerabilities, because an attackercould find a way to chain several of those less\-severe findings together to gaingreater access. We explore this observation in more detail under Remediation.Why Three Groups? A lot of pentesting organizations group vulnerabilities differently,having a Critical category for the most Likely and most Impactful vulnerabilities,and an Informational category for vulnerabilities with a very low risk. Cobalt stickswith the High, Medium, and Low categories because labeling one item as Criticalcan make other still\-risky vulnerabilities sound less important, and labeling anissue as Informational can make it sound like its not worth fixing.What vulnerability categories are the
most common? 
To get a glimpse of what flaws slip past security teams internal checks, we continue our analysiswith the top 5 most common vulnerability categories that our pentester community discovered.Unsurprisingly, 2020s list reveals vulnerabilities that are also outlined in the OWASP Top 10:Top 5 Most Common Vulnerabilities1\.Server Security Misconfigurations: 28\.1%2\.Cross\-Site Scripting: 15\.5%3\.Broken Access Control: 14\.7%4\.Sensitive Data Exposure: 8\.4%5\.Authentication and Sessions: 8%We have analyzed our data for theState of Pentesting report every yearsince 2018, and these vulnerabilitycategories have consistently beenour top 5 for each report. The orderin which they appear has shiftedover time, but Server SecurityMisconfigurations have been at thetop of the list, and by a significantmargin, every year running.This leads us to believe that security teams are struggling to effectively remove andprevent issues that are well\-known to the industry. There can be several reasons for thisgaps in secure development, insufficient investment in security awareness and training,ineffective remediation, or bugs staying open because of low perceived impact andorlack of resources. We explore more anecdotal data on this point under Remediation.5Looking deeper into our data
This year were diving one level deeper into our analysis by observing the specificfindings that come up across different methodologies, industries and company sizes.Going this granular helps us determine risk more accuratelyfor example, with Cross\-Site Scripting the risk differs considerably between the Stored and Reflected findings.But first, a word on taxonomy. Different pentest providersand cybersecurityorganizations as a wholeuse different terminology and frameworks to describetheir data. To help readers follow our report, here is an overview of the taxonomywe use at Cobalt, which is mostly guided by OWASP best practices:The building block of our taxonomy are Findings, which are the individual issues ourtesters discover. Findings are then grouped into a vulnerability category. For example:Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS)Reflected XSS
Reflected XSSStored XSS
Stored XSSFinding \#1: An instance of Reflected XSS.When an attacker passes script code to theserver in a user\-editable location within arequest, the application returns it as part of theservers response, which the users browserinterprets and renders as part of the page.Finding \#2: An instance of Stored XSS. Whenan attacker passes script code to the serverin a user\-editable location within a request,the application stores it on the server. Whenanother user accesses the affected page,that users browser interprets and rendersthe stored code as part of the page.Vulnerability Category: The root cause for both of these findings is that the application isvulnerable to Cross\-Site\-Scripting attacks, which happens when the application does not validateand encode user\-supplied input properly, so it gets treated as code, rather than as text.6With this system in mind, we looked at the top 5 findings from our entire 2020database, regardless of vertical or asset type. Heres what we found:At first glance, the percentagesmight look small, but thats in partbecause of the total number ofTop 5 Findings For 2020findings we observe in our platform.1\.Broken Access Control: Insecure Direct ObjectAmong 286 possible options thatare grouped into 23 vulnerabilitycategories, these top 5 findings wereReferences (IDOR): 9\.4% of total findings2\.Cross\-Site Scripting: Stored: 8\.7%the most commonly discovered and3\.Components with Known Vulnerabilities:represent roughly 30% of our data.Outdated Software: 4\.1%Its interesting to note thatboth of Cross\-Site Scriptingsvariations appeared frequentlyin our pentests.

And while thistype of vulnerability is rarely reflected in big breach stories, its impact on both companiesand their customers is not negligible, risking exposure to highly sensitive information.What are different assets vulnerable to?
While the top 5 overall findings help set the tone for what specific issues securityteams can focus on, they wont be helpful to every reader. Youll notice thatmany of these findings will relate to web assets, and thats partly becausethe majority of pentests we did in 2020 covered web applications.To help readers determine the most prevalent threats to their mobile applications,networks, or even combinations of different assets, weve broken the data downto the top 3 findings observed from different testing methodologies.7WebAPIMobileInternal

Software VersionNone of these flaws are 0\-day vulnerabilities. All of them have been well\-known to the industryfor years, which further strengthens our theory that there is an issue with prevention earlier inthe Software Development Lifecycle. We explore this theme in more detail under Remediation.What are different industries vulnerable to?
Some industries are under more pressure than others. For example, as the COVID\-19 pandemicdisrupted the world in 2020, the Healthcare and E\-Learning industries saw an increase incyber attacks. The FBI reported a 30% increase in attacks against E\-Learning targets, andmany hospitals and vaccine manufacturers became the targets of phishing campaigns.Based on news stories like these and our pentesting experience, we were interestedin seeing what the data said on the industries that we pentest most frequently.81st Place2nd Place3rd PlaceSaaSCross\-Site Scripting:

breakdown of findings per asset type, please refer to What are different assets vulnerable to?While the order varied slightly from industry to industry, it looked like eachdealt with similar flaws: variations of Cross\-Site Scripting, Insecure DirectObject References, and Outdated Software Version. That, however, doesntmean that different industries deal with the same level of risk.Consider the following: Many SaaS and Fintech companies completely rely on theirtechnology to keep the business running. But larger enterprises in industries likeInsurance and Healthcare are more likely to have multiple ventures and sources ofrevenue, so the tested technology could only be a small part of the bigger picture.Whats more, risk doesnt end with the companys business operations. Itultimately translates to impact on end users. For example, weak TLS ciphers ina banking app can be critical for both companies and their customers, while thesame problem in a gardening app can be considerably less exploitative.This is also why we want to highlight one concerning trend: industries which aremore likely to handle financial, health, or other sensitive data such as Healthcare,Insurance, and Fintech, are still susceptible to IDOR vulnerabilities. This well\-knownflaw could allow an attacker to bypass authorization controls and access Personally9Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI). These instancesare examples of higher risk for both the company and its customers. We recommendthat companies whose reports list this vulnerability address it as a high priority.Aside from considering what industries are vulnerable to, its also worth exploringmetrics that show how vulnerable they are. For example, it would be muchless alarming if the number of findings per asset was contained to an averageof 1 or 2, than if companies were observing a number closer to 10\.Avg \# of findings

We can easily picture the scenario wherebusinesses were pushed to prioritize faster deployments over secure development.Security teams likely looked to pentests to compensate for what slipped pastinternal checksone of many examples of how pentests can act as an effectivelayer of defense if teams are able to effectively remediate their findings.10RemediationEarlier in our report we found that the top 5 most common 
vulnerability categories in our database have stayed the same 
every year since 2018\. When we consult other sources, such as 
the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities report, this problem goes back 
even further. For example, Cross\-Site Scripting and Broken Access 
Control have made the list in each iteration since 2003\. Security 
Misconfigurations have also been a prevalent entry, dropping out 
of the list in 2007 only to reappear in later releases.This observation raises the inevitable question: why is the industrystruggling with the same well\-known problems for so long?To answer this, we wanted to better understand how security practitioners bothprevent vulnerabilities and remediate what their pentests discover. We wanted toknow if there were any internal issues that limited teams to higher priority items, butalso if there were external factors that were coming from their pentest providers.In Q1 of this year, we spoke to 601 IT security professionals across the United States,Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, all of whom worked for companies with 500 or moreemployees. They were generally familiar with pentesting, and had previously used pentestingat their companies. More information on our methodology is included in Appendix B.To start, respondents identified and fixed 54 vulnerabilities on averagein the last calendar year. And yet 6 out of 10 said they saw these sameissues re\-emerge at a later date. Why? We have a few theories.Theory \#1: Detecting vulnerabilities before code 
goes live is still a work in progress.Before we dive into pentesting\-related theories, we want to look at thebigger picture and understand why preventable issues slip past initialchecks and only come up after a third party tests for them.Results: Nearly all respondents (96%) agreed that they have to followsecure development principles to prevent vulnerabilities from re\-emerging.We wanted to know how they work towards achieving that:11What security checks does your team have in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to 
find and fix vulnerabilities before pushing code to production?Code ReviewsThreat ModelingPlaybooks \& TrainingDASTSASTIAST AnalysisAbuse Case TestsFuzzingOtherFollowing secure development principles doesnt always mean that each of these pointsneeds to be at 100%. Of the 43% who dont use code reviews, for example, some might notbe using it as diligently as they need to, while others might not need it in the first place. Butthe fact stands that vulnerabilities slip past these checks, as evidenced by our own data.What this graph can tell us is that security teams are using a combination of measures to preventvulnerabilities early on, which is something we strongly support. It takes multiple approaches tosecure ones environment. Pentesting isnt the panacea of application security, but it can validateall the other pieces of a security program and help inform what areas need to be improved.Theory \#2: Teams struggle to detect everything 
that slips past internal checks because they 
cant pentest their entire application portfolio.In addition to this theory, we also wanted to see if there were otherchallenges, for example with procurement and setup.Results: Even though 78% of study participants agree that pentesting is a high\-priorityitem for their security teams, respondents only conduct pentesting on 63% of their overallapplication portfolio on average. What challenges could be causing this disconnect?120%20%40%60%Talent Matching: 86% of respondents agreed that 
it is difficult to find andor hire people with the 
right skill sets for pentesting.Expense: 58% of our panelists believe thatpentesting is too expensive, with 42% going so 
far as to say their company does not have the 
budget to cover it.Scoping Difficulties: 61% said that pentesting isdifficult to scope.Timing: Over half of the security professionals we 
interviewed agreed that pentesting is too slow to 
schedule. How slow, exactly? Only 22% said they 
are able to get pentesting scheduled within days; 
most have to wait weeks (55%) and some even 
divulged that it takes their organization months 
(22%) to get a pentest project off the ground.On average

Instead, they are symptoms of a wider problem: the establishedpentesting procurement process makes this security control less accessible, andtherefore less reliable. To enable security teams, pentests need to be available withappropriate talent on\-demand, with simpler setup and more flexible pricing.Theory \#3: Teams might be taking too long to 
address Medium\- or Low\-risk findings.Results: Nearly all (93%) of respondents reported thattheir business solves critical vulnerabilities quickly.My company solves for critical vulnerablities quickly.The response to Low\- or Medium\-risk vulnerabilities93% Agreewas more sluggish, with two\-thirds of our respondentsagreeing that it took their team longer to respond tothese issues than it did to address High\-risk attackMy company takes more time to solve for medium 
and low vulnerabilities than it does for critical ones.points. Over half (51%) confessed that their companies66% Agreewere too slow in responding to these lower\-risk issues,and 67% feel that this practice creates significant riskto business, considering that these supposedly low\-urgency vulnerabilities can chain together and escalateinto very serious problems. To minimize risk and preventchained exploits, 79% of our study participants agreedthat their organizations need to focus just as muchon Low or Medium vulnerabilities as they do High.However, 25% of respondents reported that theircompany takes up to 60 daysor longertoaddress LowMedium\-risk vulnerabilities, and asmall but nonetheless surprising segment (1%) ofcompanies dont bother to remediate them at all.My company takes too long to solve for 
medium and low vulnerabilities.51% AgreeLack of urgent response to medium and low 
vulnerabilities creates big risk for our business.67% AgreeMy organization needs to focus just as much 
on lowmedium vulnerabilities as we do high 
in order to prevent chained exploits.79% Agree14Why is this such poor practice? For a case study on the potentially disastrous consequences ofpostponing so\-called low\-urgency remediation, look no further than the 2017 Equifax breach.This breach exposed the personal information of 148 million peoplemore than 40% of thepopulation of the United States at the timeand resulted in a record\-shattering $700 millionFTC settlement, their CEO stepping down amid massive public controversy, and $1\.4 billionspent cleaning up the mess. So how did this catastrophic breach occur? It happened becauseof a widely\-known software vulnerability for which a patch was made availablea patch thatEquifax, due to oversight in their internal processes, failed to deploy. Cobalts Chief StrategyOfficer Caroline Wong breaks it down: This was not a crazy technical problem that lacked asolution. The technical solution was available; this was a lack of people and process innovation.Theory \#4: Remediation teams could be limited 
to critical findings because of workflow issues.Results: There is definite room for improvement here. Security and engineering teams stillhave work to do to effectively collaborate, on remediation priorities and more generally. Theoutcome is lower\-risk findings staying exposed for longer and coming up again at a later test.How would you describe the current relationship 
between the security and engineering teams within 
your organization?What is holding them back? Largely,the answers are inefficient workflowsand lack of automation integrations.Very

Only 3 in 10 respondents were able to happilyreport that their companys security and engineering teams were intertwined.So what are the biggest challenges teams need to address in order to improve DevSecOpsworkflows? We posed this question to our respondents and here is what they had to say:15What are the biggest challenges your team faces when
implementing DevSecOps?Too many manual processesKnowledge gaps re. other teams areaLack of AppSec tool integrationsSecurity teams too small to keep upMisalignment between KPIsLets focus on manual processes and AppSec tool integrations, particularlyaround remediating pentest findings. Once security teams have pentest findingsin hand, how are they sending them over to their colleagues in engineering?Nearly three\-quarters of respondents said that this was handled manually within theirorganizationeither the findings were manually pushed to issue tracking software (39%) orworse, the engineering team was manually sent a PDF shared by the pentest provider (34%).Perhaps then it is not surprising that when there was misalignment with remediation priorities,half our respondents said that their engineering teams blamed workflow inefficiencies.3:43:4of respondents share

Clearly, securityteams cannot pile requests onto theseteams unless they explore ways to free up their time with more efficient and automatedprocesses. For example, engineering is not involved in pentesting setup or execution andthey rarely have a say in how findings are packaged and shared with themthese are allhandled by the security team. Therefore, the responsibility lies with the latter to improvethis workflow in order to push toward DevSecOps and remediate more effectively.160%20%40%60%ConclusionOur data strongly suggests that security teams are still struggling with the same well\-knownvulnerabilities that have plagued the industry for years. Flaws like Cross\-Site Scripting andBroken Access Control, which were among the top 5 vulnerabilities in our 2020 data, havealso been listed as a prevalent security issue in the OWASP Top 10 every year since 2003\.As much as teams aim for secure development, we conclude there are stillgaps in prevention and remediation. As to what might be causing them,and where pentesting plays a part, we discovered the following:1\.The majority of teams pursue some form of securedevelopment, but they dont catch everything. Pentesting 
is still a valuable and effective layer of defense.2\.To empower security teams to test new code earlier,pentesting needs to be faster and easier to set up, and 
more financially accessible.3\.Ignoring or delaying remediation for Medium\- and Low\-risk 
pentest findings can escalate into a larger issue that is 
more costly to fix.4\.What holds remediation teams back with fixing pentest 
findings are too many manual tasks and a lack of tool 
integrations.17For the final point, we tested a few innovation ideas with our survey respondents to learnwhat they felt is the best way to improve workflows and get more done with less. Themost popular was real\-time delivery of findings instead of a PDF report (57%), closelyfollowed by choosing a provider that offers software integrations that automaticallyshare information and status updates between both teams dashboards (56%). Halfour respondents wanted to see API integrations that allow for data consolidationand visualization, and an honorable mention went to dedicated communicationchannels for security, engineering, and pentesters to collaborate (37%).What do you think is the best way to align pentesting 
with both security and engineering roadmaps?Real\-time delivery of findingsSoftware integrationsAPI integrationsCommunication channelsThese very innovations and more are what define the movement toward Pentest as a Service(PtaaS).

of accepting any certificate signed by a trusted CertificateAuthority. After storing, or pinning, the server certificateor public key, the mobile app will only connect to the knownserver only. This instructs the application not to trust externalCertificate Authorities, which reduces the attack surface.For more information, see the OWASP cheat sheet onCertificate Pinning: https:owasp.orgwww\-communitycontrolsCertificate\_and\_Public\_Key\_PinningInsecure Data Storage: Sensitive Application Data Storage UnencryptedA vulnerable application stores cleartext sensitive informationConfigure the application to store any sensitive(such as usernames and passwords, PII, credit card data,information in an encrypted format and resource.or SSNs, depending on the application) within a resourcethat a user with the correct permissions could access.Even if the information is encoded and not human\-readable,an attacker could use various techniques to determine whichencoding is being used, then decode the information.OWASP also recommends performing threat modelling on yourapplication, to determine how it handles the following features:URL caching (requests and responses)Keyboard input cacheCopyPaste buffer cacheBackgrounded applicationIntermediate dataLoggingStored HTML5 dataBrowser cookie objectsThird\-party analytics data23What is it:What is it:How to fix it:How to fix it:What is it:How to fix it:Server\-Side Injection: Remote Code ExecutionFor some server use\-cases, a piece of softwareThe most effective method of eliminating Code Injectionmay require input from a remote user to locatevulnerabilities is to avoid allowing software to evaluateand perform its intended function.

This report is not a substitute for apentest. Our database contains well over 100 vulnerabilities, and we have mentioned just a handfulin this report. Regular pentesting can catch additional flaws beyond those we mention here, andcan find new ones that may get added as you make changes to your systems. You can also learnabout these and other vulnerabilities on the OWASP, SANS CIS Controls, and CVE websites.24What is it:How to fix it:What is it:How to fix it:Appendix B: MethodologyCobalts State of Pentesting report includes two types of data sets:Anonymized pentest data collected via Cobalts proprietary Pentest as a Service platform (referred to lateras Cobalts Pentest Data);Survey responses on questions related to pentest procurement, setup, delivery and following remediation(referred to later as Survey Collection)Cobalts Pentest Data MethodologyThe data used in this report represents all pentests executed via Cobalts Pentest as a Serviceplatform from January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020\. Cobalt delivers third\-party pentest servicesvia the Cobalt platform with the help of a highly curated and collaborative pentest community.The reported data includes information on the types of assets that were tested and their discoveredvulnerabilities, which are broken down to vulnerability categories and associated findings. This accounts fora total of 1602 pentests. The data represents large and small companies, a variety of industries ranging fromSaaS to Insurance and Fintech, and 4 geographic regions: EMEA, APAC, North America and South America.One limitation of this study is the high concentration of pentests commissioned for Web applicationsand APIs. Combined, these represent roughly 74% of all discovered findings, which is driven entirelyby customers decisions on what to have pentested. Despite the unequal distribution across assettypes, categories like Mobile applications and Internal and External networks still had enoughstatistically significant data to allow the authors to identify prevalent vulnerabilities for each.Survey CollectionTo explore questions raised in the first half of the report, the authors commissioned an additional survey intohow security practitioners procure and manage pentests, and how they remediate discovered vulnerabilities. Thesurvey collected responses from 601 security professionals who work for companies with 500\+ employees andlive and work either in the United States, or in the DACH region (Germany, Austria and Switzerland). To qualify,respondents had to have a general familiarity with and history of using pentesting throughout their careers.25ReferencesOWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks, OWASP: https:owasp.orgwww\-project\-top\-tenPfizerBioNTech vaccine docs hacked from European Medicines Agency, BBC: https:www.bbc.comnewstechnology\-55249353 (9 December, 2020\)Hospitals Suffer New Wave of Hacking Attempts, Wall Street Journal: https:www.wsj.comarticleshospitals\-suffer\-new\-wave\-of\-hacking\-attempts\-11612261802 (2 February, 2021\)Zoom tackles hackers with new security measures, BBC: https:www.bbc.comnewstechnology\-52560602 (6 May 2020\)FBI warns of cyberattacks to distance learning, ABC News: https:abcnews.go.comPoliticsfbi\-warns\-cyberattacks\-distance\-learningstory?id\=75038470 (4 January, 2021\)Equifaxs data breach disaster: Will it change executive attitudes toward security CSO Online: https:
