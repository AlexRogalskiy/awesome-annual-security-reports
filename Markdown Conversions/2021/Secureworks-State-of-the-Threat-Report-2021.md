activity clusters or intrusion sets. If CTU researchers attributean attack to a group, it is because the indicators and thetactics, techniques, and procedures observed during theattack match or align with those seen in previous activityattributed to the group. Groups are also clusters of individuals,but individual threat actors may work for more than one group,or may change groups.The names are based on metals. In this report you will meetGOLD cybercriminal groups, as well as state\-sponsoredgroups that are IRON (Russia), BRONZE (China), COBALT (Iran),

0810ConclusionPrior to February 2020, Ryuk attacks typically followed a consistentplaybook: leveraging an existing TrickBot infection for initial access,deploying PowerShell Empire or Cobalt Strike across the environment,and then staging Ryuk on domain controllers and deploying it widelyacross the enterprise using either PSExec and batch scripts or GroupPolicy Objects. The script below is a PowerShell script used to createa Group Policy Object that weakens domain\-joined systems securitysettings prior to deployment of Ryuk.However, since September 2020 this expansion has resulted indivergent tactics, techniques and procedures during observedintrusions involving Ryuk and Conti deployments. In one example inearly 2021, Secureworks incident responders helped an organizationwhere the threat actor had accessed the environment using stolenVPN credentials and deployed Conti manually to a small number ofsystems using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Not only is this asignificant departure from previously observed tactics, techniques andprocedures (TTPs), but the more localized deployment also caused farless impact to the affected organization, very unlike previous GOLDULRICK intrusions where enterprises have experienced weeks ormonths of downtime.PowerShell script (\_this\_domain.ps1\) used in Ryuk attacks to create Group Policy Object.

08Name\-and\-Shame Remains 
the Name of the GameName\-and\-shame attacks allow for double extortion. Victimsare under pressure to pay to recover their data (availability), but alsoto prevent it being published online (confidentiality). For some,the threat of sensitive business or client information being madepublic may be worse than the consequences of their systems beingencrypted. The extra threat also comes with a deadline to pay,increasing the pressure to hand over the ransom to avoid further painin an already painful situation.Name\-and\-shame has become the predominant operating methodfor most ransomware groups, with victims being added to public leaksites at a worrying rate. The most active name\-and\-shame ransomwaregroup over the past year was GOLD PHANTOMs Egregor, adding anaverage of 60 victims a month to its leak site between its launch inSeptember 2020 and its apparent demise at the end of 2020\. GOLDULRICK added an average of 23 new Conti victims a month acrossthe entire period.

Away from Encryption?Some operators have experimented with 
data theft and extortion only:In the December 2020 attack on the Accellion File 
Transfer Appliance (FTA) software by GOLD TAHOE, 
operator of Clop ransomware, all the attacker did wasexfiltrate data from the Accellion appliance and post itto the Clop leak site.Babuk separately claimed to have abandonedransomware in favor of theft and extortion only in lateApril 2021, although with limited success.In one incident worked by Secureworks incidentresponders, the threat actor was disturbed during theirlateral expansion and consolidation activity. In responseto being disrupted, the group immediately shifted intodemanding an extortion payment to prevent the datathey had already stolen being leaked online.It is unclear whether theft and extortion without dataencryption is a viable business model, even when it is donewell. Manufacturing organizations, for example, are far morelikely to feel the pain of production downtime caused bycritical systems being unavailable. Victims based in countrieswith relaxed regulatory regimes may not feel sufficientlypressured to prevent data leaking into the public domain topay the extortion fees demanded.132021 State of the Threat: A Year in ReviewOpportunistic Compromise,

Some ransomware groupsmay prioritize certain victims due to perceived success.

For example, the Clop operatorhas been reported to prioritize access to the workstations of seniorexecutives during exfiltration of data from victim organizations. Thereason for this tactic is reported to be to obtain the most valuableinformation.In other words, post\-intrusion operators are generally selectiveabout the victims they hit once initial access has been gainedand a degree of triage carried out, but the initial compromiseis opportunistic.

Affiliate schemes are thereforekey enablers to growth, but attack sophistication can vary whenaffiliates have different skill levels.usually manage the process of negotiation with victims, limiting thenumber of affiliates allows them to manage the number of victims theyare negotiating with.Affiliates can also cause groups problems. It is thought thataffiliates were behind both the REvil Kaseya attack and theDarkSide Colonial Pipeline attack.

In response to a question about whether the05Scan\-and\-ExploitU.S. was considering military action against ransomware operators, thecommerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, said4 that all the options werebeing considered. So far, a range of different response options arebeing used.This increasingly assertive law enforcement response is unlikely tochange direction in the short term. The ransomware problem remainsa difficult one to address. Many of the operators are located either inRussia or in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Ifthey avoid targeting Russian or CIS entities as victims, they are largelyThe Impact of Malware 
Loader TakedownsBoth TrickBot and Emotet were the targets of takedownactivity. There were two operations against TrickBot , one in

actions by Microsoft6 in October and November. There 
was one against the Emotet botnet in late January 2021 by

GOLD BLACKBURN has also increased its use ofother malware including Team9 (also known as BazarLoader)and BuerLoader.

PlugX malware in October and November 2020\. The November 
incident involved an updated version of PlugX that deleted older 
PlugX malware. This is not a new technique for the group in 
early 2020 it had used USB drives in campaigns in Southeast Asia, 
particularly Myanmar. Secureworks has also seen it in use against 
international NGOs and food industry organizations, as well as in 
Thailand and Japan.The use by groups like BRONZE SPIRAL of small office andhome office (SOHO) routers in the target country as the last 
hop of an attack. This makes attribution more difficult and 
also makes attack traffic look like it is terminating in the same 
country as the target, which might allow it to blend in as

0810ConclusionIn one case, CTU researchers observed the BRONZE UNION threatgroup using the Exchange vulnerabilities to re\-gain access to anenvironment that they had recently been evicted from.While the degree of sharing that took place during these intrusionswas notable, it appears increasingly common. In fact, knowledge andtool sharing across Chinese APTs is not considered unusual, withgroups using malware provided by the same Digital Quartermaster. ADigital Quartermaster is thought to be an organization that develops,maintains and supplies malware to operational threat groups that areresponsible for the intrusion activity.There is also evidence of multiple groups sharing exploits prior to thembeing publicly available. This manifestation of closer tradecraft sharingis likely to be one result of the restructuring of the Peoples LiberationArmy (PLA) that has been under way since late 2015\. It is highly likelythat similar levels of sharing are going on with groups connected tothe Ministry of State Security (MSS), which also has a remit to conductoverseas cyber operations.One example is ShadowPad, a modular remote access trojan (RAT) thatcan extract information about the host, execute commands, interactwith the file system and registry, and deploy new modules to extendfunctionality. CTU researchers assess that ShadowPad is currentlyused by at least eight different Chinese threat groups against targetsglobally including the U.S. and UK. CTU researchers discovered thatmany of the threat groups observed using ShadowPad since thebeginning of 2019 such as BRONZE BUTLER and BRONZE HUNTLEYhave been linked to the Chinese PLA. Before 2019 only BRONZEATLAS, a group operating on behalf of the MSS, leveraged theShadowPad malware.

Earlier in 2020,Secureworks incident responders identified similar intrusion activityon the same network. Analysis suggested that the threat actor initiallygained access as early as 2018 by exploiting a vulnerable public\-facing ManageEngine ServiceDesk server. attacker used their accessto periodically harvest and exfiltrate domain credentials. In August2020, the threat actor returned to the network via the ManageEngineServiceDesk server, harvested credentials from two servers, likelyexfiltrated these credentials through the ManageEngine server, andthen used them to access files from Microsoft 365\-hosted SharePointand OneDrive services.SUPERNOVA was publicly disclosed by FireEye23 in December when itrevealed details of its internal investigation of the compromise by thethreat group that CTU researchers track as IRON RITUAL. But it wasonly later in December that it became clear24 that SUPERNOVA was infact the work of a different and unrelated group. Then, on December24, 2020, SolarWinds confirmed that threat actors had exploited CVE\-2020\-10148, a SolarWinds Orion API authentication bypass vulnerabilityin its Orion Platform, to deploy SUPERNOVA.CTU researchers track the operators of the SUPERNOVA web shellas BRONZE SPIRAL. The CTU team was initially unable to attributethe August activity to any known threat groups. However, similaritiesto the BRONZE SPIRAL intrusion in late 2020 suggest that the samethreat group was responsible for both intrusions. These include use ofidentical commands, servers, working directories, and compromisedadministrator accounts.The threat group also makes extensive use of native system tools andliving off the land techniques (see below) to enable long\-term accessto target networks and theft of intellectual property.01020304Executive Summary

0810ConclusionIranOver the past year, Iranian threat groups have maintained a 
steady level of activity. Mainly this involved espionage and 
surveillance operations against individuals perceived as valuable 
information sources or potential threats to the Iranian regime, such 
as journalists, academics, human rights defenders, and employees 
of government, intergovernmental organizations (IGO), and non\-
governmental organizations (NGO). Irans main focus has been the 
Middle East Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Israel 
in particular rather than Western organizations, reflecting its 
perception of the chief source of risk to its interests. With the 
election of the new hard\-line president Ebrahim Raisi, its regional 
geographical focus may soon change.Iran also carried out cryptographic wiper attacks masquerading 
as ransomware attacks. These primarily focused on Israeli targets 
but similar wiper attacks are also starting to be seen against the 
UAE, likely as a result of the recently formed political links between 
the UAE and Israel.In the past year, CTU researchers analyzed incidents including:COBALT FOXGLOVE using a compromised Citrix server for 
entry, deploying the Ngrok tunneling tool to add an additional 
access mechanism to the environment.COBALT ULSTER carrying out spear phishing campaignstargeting Iraqi and Turkish organizations using humanitarian and 
COVID\-19\-related themes during May and June 2020\.COBALT EDGEWATER using employment\-themed lures to 
target entities in Lebanon using MailDropper malware, which 
uses mailboxes to relay C2 messages. A 2020 MailDropper 
campaign used a mailbox at the Lebanese Directorate 
of General Security. Campaigns in 2021 used mailboxes 
associated with the Lebanese Army and a leading Lebanese 
mobile telecom network operator. Threat actors could 
leverage these mailbox compromises to conduct broader 
intrusions into these networks.Lure documents associated with COBALT ULSTER. Source: Secureworks412021 State of the Threat: A Year in Review01020304Letter From Our CTIOExecutive Summary

0810ConclusionCTU researchers also investigated a May 2021 phishing campaign 
carried out by COBALT ILLUSION that used the legitimate 
Dropbox online file\-hosting platform to evade email security 
controls. The campaign involved phishing activity targeting a 
European nations Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an intergovernmental 
organization (IGO), and government employees in Israel. It is likely 
that other organizations were also targeted. At least one targeted 
individual had prior links to Iran.COBALT ILLUSION usually follows a well\-worn playbook in its phishing 
operations, appearing to pay limited attention to operational security 
and taking few measures to prevent their infrastructure from being 
identified and tracked. CTU researchers advise that customers who 
think they might be a target of Iranian groups review available log 
data for interactions with COBALT ILLUSION phishing infrastructure. 
Deploying multi\-factor authentication MFA adds additional protection, 
although COBALT ILLUSION has previously attempted to convince 
targets to divulge SMS codes and other multi\-factor tokens to bypass 
this security control.Several groups have continued Irans association 
with wipers and ransomware:The PowGoop downloader linked to Thanos ransomware 
attacks against state\-run organizations in the Middle East 
showed coding overlaps with tools seen by Secureworks 
during previous incident response engagements involving 
COBALT ULSTER. This raised the possibility that COBALT 
ULSTER could have facilitated the ransomware attacks by 
providing network access to another threat actor. Victims 
included a state\-owned oil and gas producer based in 
Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, and a governmental agency 
in Egypt. If Iranian state\-sponsored actors were involved in 
these incidents, it would suggest the attacks were designed 
more for sabotage than financial gain.Analysis of the N3tw0rm ransomware and ransom note 
observed in attacks against Israel in April 2021 indicates 
links to the Pay2Key ransomware, which was used in 2020 
operations that also focused on Israel. CTU researchers link 
Pay2Key to COBALT FOXGLOVE. N3tw0rm attacks use name\-
and\-shame tactics including bulk data theft and publication 
of victim names. The impacted organizations operate in 
Israel in the logistics, retail, and engineering verticals. CTU 
analysis suggests that the targeting is likely opportunistic but 
focused on entities that are geographically located in Israel.Although these activities look superficially like ransomware, 
they are probably not what they seem. CTU researchers believe that 
N3tw0rm and Pay2Key are used in Iranian state\-sponsored operations 
but are designed to look like cybercrime attacks to misdirect 
attribution. Any resulting financial gain may be a secondary benefit. 
Low value ransom demands may be designed to encourage victims 
to pay quickly, but the threat actors probably do not plan to provide 
a decryptor. In this model, the threat actors use the ransomware as a 
cryptographic wiper and achieve the dual purpose of data destruction 
and financial gain. A similar approach seems to be in use by the Agrius 
or Black Shadow group that attacked businesses in the insurance and 
finance sectors in Israel in late 2020 and in 2021\. It has also been seen 
using a type of wiper malware previously seen in use by threat actors 
connected with COBALT GYPSY.422021 State of the Threat: A Year in Review01020304Letter From Our CTIOExecutive Summary

0810ConclusionRussiaRussian cyber espionage activity has been under the spotlight during 
the period, with IRON HEMLOCKs network intrusions targeting 
COVID\-19 vaccine development, U.S. indictments against six GRU 
officers associated with the IRON VIKING threat group, and extensive 
media reporting of IRON RITUALs SolarWinds supply chain attack.Despite the number of headlines, Russian threat group activity 
continues to be narrowly focused against traditional espionage targets 
such as government, non\- and inter\-governmental organizations 
(NGOs and IGOs), policy and think tanks, and related supply chain 
organizations. Nowhere was this better illustrated than with the 
SolarWinds campaign, where CTU researchers observed IRON 
RITUAL deliberately and permanently disabling their own access 
to all Secureworks customers who had downloaded the trojanized 
SolarWinds code, presumably on the basis that they were not deemed 
to be relevant to their goals and they wanted to minimize the chances 
of detection.IRON RITUAL itself also carried other, somewhat less sophisticated 
attacks. One example was a U.S. Agency for International Development 
(USAID)\-themed phishing campaign26 targeting governmental, 
non\-governmental organizations (NGOs), and intergovernmental 
organizations (IGOs) based in the United States, Ukraine, and 
the European Union. A second campaign targeted IT companies, 
government bodies, NGOs, think tanks, and financial services in the 
U.S UK, Germany, Canada, and 32 other countries using password\-
spraying and brute force attacks.USAID\-themed phishing email. (Source: Secureworks)442021 State of the Threat: A Year in ReviewHowever, not all Russian threat groups have continued torely on historic tried\-and\-tested techniques. In July 2021,U.S. and UK security agencies released a joint advisory29 about IRONTWILIGHTs use of a Kubernetes cluster to conduct distributed brute\-force attacks against Microsoft 365, on\-premises email servers, andother service providers. The use of an attacker\-owned Kubernetescluster is notable, as it offers automation, scalability, and the ability toredeploy infrastructure rapidly and easily across various commercialproviders to evade IP\-based blocking.Despite similar targets, the TTPs used in these campaigns 
were considerably less sophisticated than those used in the 
SolarWinds campaign and far more easily detected. The USAID 
phishing activity was high volume, noisy, and required a user to 
perform a series of actions before malware could be installed to 
provide ongoing access to the machine. The second campaign 
involved spraying large numbers of username and password 
combinations in an attempt to guess login credentials, and was 
assessed by Microsoft to have been largely unsuccessful.A lack of subtlety also marked other elements of other Russianstate\-sponsored activity observed over the period. This includedIRON LIBERTY27 targeting28 U.S. government and aviation networksin September 2020\. Tactics used included brute\-force passwordattacks, SQL injection, domain spoofing of legitimate aviation andgovernment organizations, spear phishing, strategic web compromises,and harvesting NTLM credentials. Vulnerabilities that were reportedlyleveraged affected Citrix Netscaler (CVE\-2019\-19781\), MicrosoftExchange (CVE\-2020\-0688\), Exim (CVE\-2019\-10149\), Fortinet VPN(CVE\-2018\-13379\), and Windows NetLogon (CVE\-2020\-1472\).01020304Letter From Our CTIOExecutive Summary

over the period, although they still lag behind Russia and China. North 
Korean groups continued to prioritize specific organizations and 
individuals involved in defense, government and security research in 
South Korea and the U.S Other targets included those in neighboring 
East Asian countries, especially Japan. The targeting of entities in 
Russia, Israel and India was also observed.Unlike other nation state cyber operations, North Korea places a 
strong emphasis on revenue generation. This was in evidence before 
the coronavirus pandemic when the country needed to address the 
economic damage caused by UN sanctions in response to North 
Koreas nuclear weapons program. It is even more of a focus now as 
it deals with the crippling impact of its border closure with China by 
far its largest trading partner to limit the spread of the disease. North 
Korean state groups have used ransomware, cryptocurrency thefts and 
manipulation of the global financial system, such as SWIFT, in pursuit of 
topping up ailing state bank accounts. This motivation to make moneyplaces North Korean targeting more in line with some cybercrime 
groups than other hostile nation states. Companies that are not 
traditional nation\-state APT targets could find themselves in the sights 
of these groups.Organizations involved in defense research, particularly those in South 
Korea, continue to be a top target for espionage\-focused North 
Korean threat groups. Individual defense contractors have also been 
targeted with lure documents that deploy malware. A campaign by 
the NICKEL ACADEMY group used social engineering techniques to 
target security researchers30, possibly in the hope of obtaining zero\-
day vulnerabilities that could be used in their attacks.In late 2020, North Korean groups also targeted31 organizations 
involved in COVID\-19 vaccination research. Based on tactics observed

0810ConclusionCOVID\-19 cases in North Korea, and it has turned down offers 
of vaccines from Russia. However, while some crossover in 
operational objectives between threat groups is expected, efforts by 
these three normally separate groups could indicate that the North 
Korean government set this specific espionage objective as 
an overarching priority.In one example, Secureworks incident responders found evidence that 
NICKEL HYATT compromised a life sciences company in East Asia in Q3 
1\. This life sciences company had been known to be working on 
COVID\-19 vaccine development and manufacturing. The threat actors 
obtained initial access by compromising a managed service provider 
and then leveraged a jump host intended for remote administration of 
the network. The intrusion was detected at an early phase, and initial 
data exfiltration was limited to network enumeration\-related log data. 
Tools used during the intrusion included some seen in previous 
NICKEL HYATT engagements as well as others new to our 
observations of their activity.Cryptocurrency heists were another way for North Korean groups 
to steal money. U.S. authorities reported in February 2021 that North 
Korean threat groups had targeted organizations for cryptocurrency 
theft in over 30 countries in 2020 alone. North Korea has used 
AppleJeus malware disguised as cryptocurrency trading platforms 
since at least 2018 and have also been seen employing TFlower

an encrypted payload to be written to a named pipe that 
it creates, and then injects the payload into a legitimate 
Windows executable.The BRONZE ATLAS threat group used a custom loader 
that exploited a 2013 vulnerability33 with an opt\-in fix to 
reflectively load a Cobalt Strike raw stageless payload
