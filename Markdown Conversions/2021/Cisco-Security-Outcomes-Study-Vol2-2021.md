(Re)Introducing the Fab Five
The 2021 Cisco Security Outcomes Study sought to measure what matters most in cybersecurity 
management. To that end, we examined 25 general security practices and tested how each 
correlates with the achievement of 11 program\-level outcomes. You can view these practice\-
outcome correlations via an interactive visualization on the 2021 Cisco Security Outcomes Study 
website, or download the full report.
From the testing, we uncovered that five of the 25 practices stood out from the rest in terms of total 
contribution to security program success across all measured outcomes.
In the pages that follow, we focus on these Fab Five drivers of security program success to 
identify strategies for maximizing their effectiveness. The Fab Five are:
The broad efficacy of these practices 
begs the question, Why? What makes 
them so key to unlocking success? What 
factors make them more or less effective? 
How should companies implement these 
practices to maximize outcomes? These 
are the kinds of questions we want to 
explore in this iteration of the Security 
Outcomes Study.
In the pages that follow, we focus on 
these Fab Five drivers of security 
program success to identify strategies 
for maximizing their effectiveness. We do 
this through an independently conducted, 
double\-blind survey of over 5,
100 IT and 
security professionals around the world. 
We dig into the data, extract salient 
findings, and share vetted takeaways 
to help unlock new heights of security 
achievement for your organization.

Key Findings
We asked over 5,
100 IT and security professionals across 27 countries about their organizations approaches 
to updating and integrating security architecture, detecting and responding to threats, and staying resilient 
when disaster strikes. As you might imagine, they shared a wide range of insights, struggles, strategies, and 
successes. We analyzed every response in multiple ways, extracting key findings like those featured below.
Update and integrate 
architecture
Modern, well\-integrated IT contributes 
to overall program success more than 
any other security practice or control.
Newer, cloud\-based architectures 
are much easier to refresh regularly 
to keep pace with the business.
Organizations that source mainly from 
a single vendor double their chances 
of building an integrated tech stack.
Integrated security technologies are 
seven times more likely to achieve 
high levels of process automation.
Detect and respond 
to cyber threats
SecOps programs built on strong 
people, processes, and technology 
see a 3\.5X performance boost over 
those with weaker resources.
Outsourced detection and response 
teams are perceived to be superior, 
but internal teams show faster mean\-
time\-to\-respond (6 days vs. 13 days).
Teams that extensively use 
threat intelligence are twice as 
likely to report strong detection 
and response capabilities.
Automation more than doubles 
the performance of less 
experienced people, and makes 
strong teams near certain (95%) 
to achieve SecOps success.
Stay resilient when 
disaster strikes
Organizations with board\-level 
oversight of business continuity 
and disaster recovery are the 
most likely (11% above average) to 
report having strong programs.
The probability of maintaining 
business resilience doesnt improve 
until business continuity and 
disaster recovery capabilities cover 
at least 80% of critical systems.
Organizations that regularly test their 
business continuity and disaster recovery 
capabilities in multiple ways are 2\.5 times 
more likely to maintain business resiliency.
Organizations that make chaos 
engineering standard practice 
are twice as likely to achieve 
high levels of resiliency.

Our prior study found that a proactive approach to refreshing and maintaining best\-of\-breed IT 
and security technologies contributed more to a successful cybersecurity program than any other 
practice. Thats no small feat considering all 25 of the practices we tested are widely considered 
best practices in their own right. So, we were keen to dig into what makes this practice so 
effective in this follow\-up study.
As we begin digging deeper into tech refresh strategies, lets do a quick sniff test of the freshness 
of existing infrastructure. We asked respondents what proportion of their active security technologiesare outdated. On average, 39% of security technologies used by organizations are considered outdated. 
Almost 13% of respondents claim that at least 8 out of 10 security tools they use are showing their age.
This fact alone may help explain a lot of the benefits we see from a proactive tech refresh strategy. 
Ostensibly, newer technologies bring advanced capabilities to bear against an ever\-advancing horde of 
cyber threats. But theres more to it than that, so lets keep digging into questions we asked of the data.

Do infrastructure traits impact refresh initiatives?
In the original study, we speculated that 
more modern, cloud\-based architectures 
might be more effective because theyre 
easier to manage and have native security 
measures built in. As a step toward testing 
that hypothesis, we asked respondents togenerally describe their tech infrastructure 
by choosing a set of scaled descriptors, 
including:
Cloud vs. On\-prem
Modern vs. Outdated
Consolidated vs. Distributed
Do these different architectural traits 
contribute to the efficacy of tech refresh 
capabilities? Very much so, according to 
Figure 1\. Organizations with modern, 
consolidated, cloud\-based architectures 
are more than twice as likely to report 
strong tech refresh capabilities than 
those using outdated, distributed, on\-
prem technologies. Before waving that 
chart around in the next cloud migration 
strategy meeting, however, take note that 
organizations with predominantly on\-prem 
environments still perform well above par, 
provided theyve modernized IT.
Sure, being cloud\-native makes it 
easier to unshackle your tech refresh 
strategy, but being outdated is the more 
pressing issue here. When keeping older 
infrastructure fresh becomes an uphill 
battle, you might make more headway 
migrating to a new architecture than 
continuing to retrofit the old. Thats not 
always possible or cost\-effective with 
legacy or critical infrastructure, of course, 
but the general principle still applies.

Do frequent upgrades help security keep up with business?
According to the 2021 Security Outcomes Study, the outcome most strongly correlated with a proactive tech refresh strategy was 
enabling the security program to keep up with the demands and growth of the business. In fact, that was the strongest practice\-
outcome combination across the whole study.

We asked organizations about the 
frequency of their IT and security 
upgrades, and compared those answers 
to their security programs stated ability 
to keep up with the business. Is there a 
relationship between those two variables? 
Yes indeed; we found steady improvement 
in this key outcome as the cadence of 
upgrades increased. Overall, organizations 
that upgrade IT and security technologies 
quarterly are about 30% more likely to 
excel at keeping up with the business 
than those who only upgrade every few 
years. Sounds like a good motivational 
poster for stressed IT teams: Keep Current 
and Carry On.

set of questions. It is provided for reference, and should guide you to understand who is doing better than average, and who is not up to snuff. We are also displaying uncertainty through error bars or 
shaded areas on some charts. When those areas overlap the Overall line, it means we cant infer that particular aspect of a security program has any effect on the outcome or practice we are examining.

What (or who) should drive tech refresh efforts?
Weve established that frequent upgrades contribute to enabling the business, but what or who should drive the process 
of getting those upgrades done? We asked respondents to select their organizations primary drivers for refreshing security 
technologies, and their responses fell into three broad categories: 
Vendor\-driven: Schedule is 
determined by a SaaS provider or is 
part of a larger vendor consolidation 
initiative (most common driver)
Proactive: On a predetermined 
schedule or when new features or use 
cases warrant an upgrade (second 
most common)
Reactive: In response to an incident, 
when tech becomes obsolete, or to 
satisfy compliance requirements (least 
common)
These drivers are interesting in and of themselves, but what we really want to know is whether such motives correlated with a stronger 
approach to tech refresh. The answer is found in Figure 3, which basically says that tech refresh initiatives are more successful when 
vendors handle them (or are at least actively involved in making them happen). Less than half of those with a reactive approach 
report strong refresh capabilities, compared to almost two\-thirds of those that sync with vendor refresh cycles.

We get it this all sounds really suspect 
coming from a vendor of IT and security 
products. But we honestly had zero 
influence on this finding. The survey was 
conducted by an independent, reputable 
research firm, the respondents had no idea 
Cisco sponsored the survey, and the well\-
respected Cyentia Institute analyzed the 
data to derive what you see in Figure 3\. 
And for good measure, well be extra 
cautious in interpreting these results. 
We suspect much of the improvement 
attributed to vendor\-driven approaches 
ties to cloudSaaS architectures being 
more friendly to frequent upgrades. 
Well also note that this may be less 
about vendors being great and more 
about escaping the internal roadblocks 
and political quagmires that tend to 
impede tech refresh schedules.
In the words of Rob Base and DJ E\-Z Rock, 
It takes two to make a thing go right. It 
takes two to make it outta sight. Who knew 
they were security architects! Make your 
refresh strategy outta sight by harnessing 
the inertia of your technology solution 
partners to drive mission outcomes.

Upgrade for capability or compatibility?
The prior section covered which scenarios prompt organizations to upgrade technologies, and now well look at why they choose one solution 
over another. Figure 4 relays what respondents told us about their selection criteria. Integrating well with existing tech is the clear preference, 
followed by solutions that offer best\-of\-breed capabilities or that meet particular needs. Perhaps surprisingly, minimizing cost ranks last.

Thats all well and good, but does any

that, we grouped the selection criteria

existing tech; Use of preferred vendors

We then tested these categories against an aggregated score created for each organization based on their level of achievement 
across the 11 security outcomes. The absolute value of the score has no particular meaning, but it does provide a point of 
comparison for the different tech refresh strategies. As seen in Figure 5, prioritizing integration and capabilities both drive 
outcomes more than selecting products based on minimizing cost or meeting baseline compliance requirements. But an 
integration\-led approach is the only one that significantly outperforms the average.

Note that the differences here are pretty small in terms of overall program success. And its likely that what were really seeing here 
is a window into the broader priorities and practices of the security program. But this does suggest that softer issues like why we 
choose one product over another are worth considering. And if youre struggling to rank features when refreshing or upgrading 
security solutions, take this as a reasonable justification to push for compatibility and capability over minimizing cost.
Whats the security 
outcomes score?
We asked respondents about their organizations level of success across 12 different 
security program outcomes. The first edition of the Security Outcomes Study 
analyzed these in detail, and youll see some of them examined individually in 
this study, too. But we also wanted to create an aggregated score that captures 
each organizations level of achievement across all 12 outcomes as a measure of 
how the security program is performing overall. We refer to that as the security 
outcomes score, and youll see it referenced a few times in this report. 
To get the score, we used a fancy statistics technique called Item Response 
Theory. This technique enables us to score organizations based on how theyre 
doing across all outcomes, while at the same time accounting for the fact that some 
outcomes might be harder to achieve than others. This tried\-and\-true technique is 
how standardized test scores are created. The absolute value of the score has no 
particular meaning, but it does provide a point of comparison among programs.

CISOs have to be both influencers and educators. If 
were going to be as effective as possible, we need 
to be on the leading edge of the strategy decisions 
being made in our organizations. But while were 
trying to convince people that security is important, 
that we need the right investments to do it well, and 
that we should be involved in every aspect of the 
business, we must also educate. Most executives 
do not have a background in security, so we need to 
inform them every step of the way about the types of 
risks were introducing with each decision we make.

Achieving Well\-Integrated 
Security Technologies
According to our last Security Outcomes Study, well\-integrated security technologies that work 
effectively with broader IT infrastructure contribute to the likelihood of success for all program 
outcomes. We asked a range of questions designed to dig deeper into the factors behind that 
laudable feat, starting with the intentions behind security tech integrations.
According to respondents, the most common motive for integrating security technologies is to 
improve the efficiency of monitoring and auditing. That resonates with us too, as were familiar with 
the pain and frustration of having to check numerous consoles or dashboards to piece together some 
semblance of whats happening across the network. Easier collaboration and automation were also 
common drivers for integrating security technologies (more on the latter coming up). We tested 
these motivations against reported tech integration levels and program outcomes, but the correlation 
wasnt that strong. Perhaps what or how is more important than why when integrating security 
technologies? Lets pull on that thread a little more in the following questions.

According to respondents, 
the most common motive for 
integrating security technologies 
is to improve the efficiency of 
monitoring and auditing.
Buy or build for well\-integrated tech?
We know from the prior study that integrating security technologies drives outcomes, but whats the best way to achieve a highly 
integrated tech stack? Buy it that way? Build to suit? Just let it be? Lets see if we can find out.
We asked organizations about their typical approach to security technology integration, and Figure 6 tallies the responses. Overall, 
more than three\-quarters of organizations would rather buy integrated solutions than build them. Of those organizations, over 
40% choose technologies that come with out\-of\-the\-box integrations into their existing infrastructure. And more than 37% take that 
one step further and prefer to source solutions from a single vendor so theyre natively well\-integrated or part of a larger platform. 
Just over 20% are willing to build integrations themselves, provided the product fits their needs. Few take a laissez\-faire approach.

Figure 7 evaluates whether any of these integration approaches makes a difference. Here we again see a theme pointing to benefits 
from collaborating with vendors to keep technology modern and well\-integrated. As seen in the chart, sticking with a preferred 
vendor is over twice as likely to achieve well\-integrated security technologies as a hands\-off approach (\~69% vs. \~31%). 
Furthermore, according to our research, that finding remains consistent across all organization sizes, though the benefits of using a 
preferred vendor are somewhat higher for small and midsize firms versus large enterprises. 
And yes, were aware thats another suspiciously convenient finding coming from a company with an extensive, integrated security 
portfolio. Sure, were pleased to see that this result supports Ciscos strategybut recall that this was a double\-blind study and we 
didnt manipulate that result at all.
Not surprisingly, organizations that didnt do anything extra to integrate security technologies became a self\-fulfilling prophecy. 
We do, however, expect that some will be surprised to learn theres virtually no difference among those that buy products with 
out\-of\-the\-box integrations and those that build integrations on their own. Just under half (\~49%) of organizations using each of 
these approaches report strong integration levels.

Cloudy, with a chance of integration
Weve heard from many organizations wrestling with the decision whether to begin (or expand) their security tech integration efforts 
in the cloud or in on\-prem environments. If thats you, we have some data that might help that evaluation. The good news is that 
many survey respondents report good results in both on\-premises and cloud environments. That said, it appears to be significantly 
easier to achieve strong tech integration in the cloud.

Does integration aid automation?
Referring back to the start of this section, automation isnt the most common motivation for tech integration. But 44% of organizations 
did identify it as an incentive. Motivations aside, is there evidence that well\-integrated technologies actually do enable better 
automation of security processes? The evidence put forward in Figure 9 points to that indeed being the case.

The two horizontal bars in Figure 9 distinguish organizations based on their level of security tech integration (strong vs. weak). The 
color segments represent the number of major security processes (event monitoring, incident analysis, and incident response) 
supported by mature automation. The proportion of organizations with no automation is more than twice as high among those with 
weak integration. Conversely, those with well\-integrated security technologies were almost seven times more likely to achieve 
high levels of automation for all three of these processes (4\.1% vs. 28\.5%). That sounds like a compelling motivation indeed!
Which functions should be integrated?
Next, we asked respondents about their level of integration among technologies supporting the five core functions of the NIST 
Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). They answered on a scale ranging from highly fragmented (siloed technologies that work mostly in 
isolation) to highly integrated (coordinated technologies that work as a functional unit). Then we created a model to determine the 
effect on the overall security outcomes score for each organization.
The results in Figure 10 are fairly consistent across the five functions. Working to defragment and integrate any of the NIST CSF 
functional areas corresponds to an increase in security program success (\+11% to \~15%). Thus, the answer to our titular question 
is all of them. But a highly integrated Identify function boasts the biggest boost if youre wondering where to start.

We cant help but see a connection between this fact and what we learned in the previous section about monitoring, auditing, and 
collaboration being the strongest drivers for integrating technology. Together, they seem to advocate for the foundational importance 
of good visibility across the enterprise. It certainly makes sense that a fragmented approach to developing an organizational 
understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities (CSF language) wont end well. Youll 
see this theme further reinforced as we roll into the Threat Detection and Incident Response section.
On integration, identification, and information
Beyond the chart we just discussed, data throughout this study consistently points to the crucial relationship between integration, 
identification, and information. If you cant identify an asset or threat, you wont know its there, and therefore wont be concerned 
enough to establish an informed defense until its too late. 
Figure 11 illustrates this concept well. We compared each organizations reported level of integration within the NIST CSF Identify 
function to their ability to accurately detect threats in a timely manner. Organizations with highly integrated systems for identifying 
critical assets and risks boasted much stronger (\+41%) threat detection capabilities. So, in a real sense, fighting fragmentation and 
fighting foes go hand\-in\-hand!

Developing Threat Detection and 
Incident Response Capabilities
This section covers two separate security practice areas that both made the Fab Five in their own 
right. But because threat detection and incident response (IR) often share people, processes, and 
technologies under the banner of security operations (SecOps), we asked a set of common questions 
between them. Thus, it makes sense to analyze them within the same section for this study.
Nearly all (about 92%) of organizations 
with strong people, process, and 
technology achieve advanced threat 
detection and response capabilities.
Security Outcomes Study, Volume 2

Prioritize people, process, or technology?
Speaking of people, processes, and technology (aka the p\-p\-t triad), lets start our investigation there. Security functions are often 
described as a combination of all three elements, particularly in the domain of threat detection and incident response. But is any part 
of this security trinity more critical than the others? You know where this is going; lets jump into the analysis.
Starting from the bottom of Figure 12, we see that only about a quarter of programs lacking strength in all facets of the p\-p\-t triad 
express confidence in their SecOps. Gaining strength in any one area people, process, or technology boosts that percentage 
up to roughly 60% to 64%, depending on which one. Strong people appear to grant a slight edge, but the overlapping confidence 
intervals caution against making too much of that fact. The important takeaway is that any of these offer a good starting point for 
building better detection and response capabilities.

Thats why we posed a couple follow\-up questions about specific architectures. We asked respondents about their adoption of 
zero trust and secure access service edge (SASE) to better understand how those approaches affect threat detection and incident 
response capabilities (and therefore security program outcomes).

Organizations that claim to have mature 
implementations of zero trust or SASE 
are about 35% more likely to report 
strong SecOps than those with nascent 
implementations. These results corroborate 
the evidence we shared earlier about the 
many benefits modern architectures can 
bring to cybersecurity programs.

Do more heads mean fewer headaches?
We know that good people are important to building strong threat detection and incident response capabilities. But is it better to focus on 
adding more people or adding to the skills of the people you have? Obviously, that doesnt have to be mutually exclusive, but the question 
remainsdo we see any evidence that quantity or quality is more important when it comes to developing successful SecOps teams?
To answer that, we first calculated a ratio of SecOps staff to overall employees for all organizations. We then compared that ratio 
to the reported strength of detection and response capabilities. Figure 14 depicts the outcome of those calculations, and while it 
doesnt fully answer the question of quantity or quality, it does offer some takeaways.

Figure 14: Effect of security staffing ratio on threat detection and incident response capabilities
First among these takeaways is that security staffing ratios do correlate with better threat 
detection and response. Organizations with the highest ratios are just over 20% more 
likely to report stronger capabilities than those with the lowest. BUTsee how the dotted 
line marking the overall average crosses through much of the shaded confidence interval 
in Figure 14? That basically means that organizations not on the extreme ends of the 
staffing scale (the majority of them) are equally likely to report strong SecOps programs.
What does all that actually mean? Well, we can say with confidence that organizations 
with huge security teams are significantly more likely to achieve strong detection and 
response capabilities than those with skeleton crews. But headcount alone wont 
make all your SecOps headaches go away or guarantee success. Furthermore, even the 
differences between the smallest and largest staffing ratio dont account for the performance 
boost associated with having strong people resources in the previous section. 
Thus, were left to infer that quality is equallyperhaps even moreimportant than 
quantity when it comes to building strong threat detection and response teams.
Security teams continue to 
face a severe staffing shortage. 
With shrunken resources and 
rising threats, many cybersecurity 
professionals are experiencing extreme 
stress and burnout. What proactive 
measures can we take to help their

SecOps staffing: Yours, mine, or ours?
So, SecOps success isnt merely about headcount, but do staffing models affect outcomes? All things being equal, is it better to 
outsource, insource, or share responsibilities for threat detection and response? Lets see how the data answers that question
but be warnedit kind of speaks out of both sides of its mouth on this one.
We asked respondents about their staffing models and then compared that with the rating of their detection and response 
capabilities. As seen in Figure 15, organizations with predominantly insourced or outsourced teams were much more likely 
(\+20% to 30%, respectively) to report strong SecOps programs than those with a mixed staffing model. Since most organizations 
said they used some form of mixed model, we thought it would be worth looking at this from a different perspective before dooming 
them all to failure just because the survey (seems to) indicate this outcome.

In addition to asking respondents to rate the perceived strength of detection and response capabilities, we also tried to obtain more 
objective metrics for comparison. One of those is Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), or the average time to remediate or contain a 
security incident. In our background analysis outside this report, these metrics often tend to directionally agree with the subjective 
assessments. But the two perspectives contradicted each other in this case, as is evident from Figure 16\.

Figure 16: Effect of staffing models on Mean Time to Respond to security incidents2 
Based on Figure 16s side of the story, organizations with internal threat detection and response teams enjoy an MTTR thats 
less than half that of outsourced models (about 6 days vs. 13 days). Those with hybrid staffing models land in the middle 
(about 8 days), with MTTRs that arent quite as quick as internal teams but much faster than their mostly outsourced counterparts. 
Obviously, we have a bit of a quandary 
here. Which measure (perspective vs. 
metric) is right and, more importantly, 
which one should you listen to in terms of 
making sourcing decisions. Were going to 
be intentionally dodgy here and say both 
and neither (heydont blame us for 
following the datas conflicting lead here).
Of course, remediation has many elements 
and dependencies to it. The organization 
may be dependent on a vendor to issue a 
patchbug fix to fully resolve a vulnerability. 
That patch then needs to be lab tested in 
their environment before being deployed 
into production. Suffice it to say there are 
a lot of moving parts involved.
In truth, its hard to know for sure whats 
going on here. Maybe trying to collect 
metrics via a survey is misleading. Maybe 
MTTR and capability ratings are different 
enough that its possible to have a strong 
detection and response program overall, 
yet slower remediation rates. Maybe those 
programs are slower because theyre 
more thorough. Maybe coordinating with 
outsourced staff just takes longer. Maybe 
theres a sense of confidence because 
were paying the experts to do this and 
theyve got it covered. Maybe were 
seeing a SecOps version of the Dunning\-
Kruger Effect. Its probably all this and 
more. And because of that, we suggest 
using this section to spark discussions 
rather than make decisions.2 We use the geometric mean in this chart as it is more representative of a typical value. The reported MTTR was typically less than 2\-3 weeks, but occasionally respondents reported months (or years!). 
Using the geometric mean manages to represent typical better without being skewed by those extremely large values.

Is it smart to use intelligence?
Speaking of the Dunning\-Kruger Effect, thats a perfect setup for this section. We asked respondents about the use of cyber threat 
intelligence in their SecOps program. Most organizations (85%) say theyre using intelligence at some level, but less than a third (31%) 
claim to be using it extensively. Does that intel lead to better, smarter, faster threat detection and response? Welllets look at Figure 17\.
Curiously, most organizations that dont use threat intelligence at all seem to think theyre doing pretty well. The old adage of ignorance 
is bliss comes to mind here, especially since dipping a toe in the intel waters apparently dispels those notions (about 84% down to 
46% confidence). Organizations that make extensive use of threat intelligence are nearly twice as likely to report strong detection 
and response capabilities compared to those with lower usage. And in an example where capability ratings and metrics agree, 
those that leverage intel more heavily achieve MTTRs that are about half that of non\-intel users.

Is automation a substitute for people?
After reading this title, you might have assumed it was a rhetorical question. Not so fast. At the risk of drawing the ire of the entire 
security community, were going to go out on a (data) limb here to suggest that automation can, in fact, replace people. BUT keep 
reading before you decide to delete this report and add us to your blocked contacts list. 
Figure 18 incorporates elements youve seen before in separate chartssecurity staff and automation. The two lines compare two 
different types of SecOps programs. The first (dark blue line) represents organizations that DO NOT have strong people resources, 
while those that DO enjoy that luxury are represented by the bright blue line. In both scenarios, moving from left to right shows the 
effect of increasing levels of automation on threat detection and IR capabilities.

Figure 18: Effect of staffing and automation strength on threat detection and incident response capabilities
Lets start with the Have Nots. Only about 
a third of organizations that lack strong 
security staff and dont automate any 
major processes report strong detection 
and response capabilities. That jumps a 
lot when one of the three process areas 
we inquired about (threat monitoring, 
event analysis, incident response) is 
automated. Automating two of those 
further ups the value, and automating 
all three more than doubles the 
performance of less experienced staff 
alone. Over three\-quarters of SecOps 
programs that dont have strong staffing 
resources are still able to achieve 
robust capabilities through high levels 
of automation.
Now trace your eye or finger from the 
rightmost point on the dark blue line to 
the first point of the bright blue line. Did 
you catch the implication? A SecOps 
program with a weaker staff that 
employs advanced automation rates 
close to the same as one with a strong 
staff and poor automation. Or said 
differently, strong automation can be 
a substitute for a strong staff. Seewe 
wouldnt lie to you! 
But man vs. machine isnt really the main 
point or most important lesson from 
Figure 18\. Following the blue line through 
successive levels of automation provides 
very compelling justification for pursuing 
both objectives. Security programs that 
manage to assemble a strong team AND 
automate major threat detection and 
response processes are almost assured 
(more than 95%) of SecOps success. So, 
dont use automation as a substitute for 
a talented workforce. Use it to augment 
your talent by allowing them to focus on 
high\-priority activities.

How often should we tweak, hack, and hunt?
One could name any number of recurring 
activities that could potentially improve 
threat detection and response programs. In 
an informal poll we took on that topic, three 
were recommended more than any others: 
Testing and updating detection rules 
and use cases
Proactively hunting for signs of 
malicious activity
Engaging in red andor purple team 
exercises
We asked respondents how often their 
organizations conduct each of those 
activities and then checked that against 
the reported strength of threat detection 
and response capabilities. The resulting 
trend in Figure 19 couldnt be any clearer.

Ensuring Prompt Disaster 
Recovery and Resilience
Its interesting how the top of mind\-ness of different aspects of cybersecurity ebb and flow over 
time. After taking a backseat to data breaches and cyber espionage for a number of years, the 
topic of business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) is once again front\-and\-center. And 
theres good reason for it. Rampant ransomware, outages of major hosting providers, and so on 
have forced major changes in strategies for ensuring resiliency in the face of relentless threats.
The 2021 Security Outcomes Study ranked prompt disaster recovery as the fourth strongest 
contributor to building successful cybersecurity programs. It showed significant correlations with 
all 11 outcomes except one (security culture). With that in mind, lets examine strategies for 
maximizing the effectiveness of this practice and ensuring resilience.

Should disaster recovery have board\-level oversight?
We were curious to know who had ultimate oversight of disaster recovery capabilities. It turns out the buck stops fairly evenly with the 
CIO, CISO, and other non\-IT members of the C\-Suite, with about a quarter of organizations BCDR processes reporting up to each. 
Board\-level visibility is a little less common than those, but still present in 18% of organizations in our survey.
When we compared these answers to each respondents assessment of their business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, 
it became apparent that the question of oversight isnt just a curiosity. Per Figure 20, organizations with board\-level oversight 
of BCDR are the most likely (11% above average) to report having strong programs. Business continuity and disaster recovery 
functions that topped out with the CIO exhibit the lowest rates that fall significantly below the average.

Figure 20: Effect of top\-level organizational oversight on disaster recovery capabilities
There are many plausible explanations 
for the results in Figure 20\. We suspect 
organizations answering to the board 
on disaster recovery matters likely have 
heightened concerns over operational 
risk and resiliency. Those concerns 
presumably translate into tighter 
oversight, stronger support, and bigger 
budgets. So, if your organization is 
struggling to improve disaster recovery 
capabilities, it might make sense to build 
them top\-down rather than bottom\-up.
What about the day\-to\-day operation of disaster recovery?
In addition to ultimate oversight, we also asked whos responsible for running 
the more tactical aspects of disaster recovery. Operations residing within 
cybersecurity or specialized business continuity teams tend to report the best 
performance. Programs run by IT generally fell below those. Interestingly, board\-
level visibility seems to act as a rising tide that lifts all boats. Success rates were 
statistically equal regardless of where day\-to\-day responsibilities fell as long as 
ultimate oversight went up to the boardroom.

Is the scope of disaster recovery important?
You probably wont be shocked to learn that disaster doesnt conveniently strike only when or where youre ready for it. Cybersecurity 
disasters are no different, which is why conventional wisdom in the field is to prepare for all eventualities as best you can. Thats 
easier said than done, of course.
Attesting to that fact, less than three out of ten organizations say their disaster recovery functions cover at least 80% of critical 
systems. Half fall into the 50% to 79% zone, and a little under 20% admit coverage rates lower than that. At first blush, that doesnt 
seem too bad. Afterall, most organizations have the majority of their critical systems covered. Unfortunately, that fact ignores the 
pesky tendency of disasters to strike in unexpected places. Our data suggests that this happens more often than wed like to admit.

Figure 21 measures a new outcome 
added for this study aimed at measuring 
the organizations ability to maintain 
business continuity through disruptive 
events. It turns out that its one of the 
three outcomes respondents report 
struggling with the most. That makes it all 
the more important to find effective ways 
of improving the likelihood of success.
Theres an important message in Figure 
21 about maintaining business continuity. 
Namely, theres virtually no improvement 
in the probability of achieving this 
outcome until BCDR capabilities cover 
at least 80% of critical systems. 
This almost certainly goes back to 
disasters uncanny propensity to strike 
where were not ready. The lesson here 
is that we cant expect investments 
in business continuity and disaster 
recovery to result in immediate or 
equivalent outcomes. Thats probably 
not a welcome message, but then again, 
disaster is never a welcome messenger.

Does practice make for perfect disaster recovery?
Well tip our hand for this question and give the answer right up front. No, it unfortunately does not. But it does make it a lot better 
than not practicing at all. How much better? Keep reading
A well\-known military adage says, No plan survives first contact with the enemy. It turns out that rolls over quite well into the 
cyber battlefield, and there are many different ways of testing BCDR capabilities, including plan walkthroughs, tabletop exercises, 
live testing, parallel testing, and full production testing. We asked respondents about how often their organizations engage in such 
exercises, and compared that to their likelihood of maintaining business continuity.

Should we unleash the chaos monkey?
On the topic of stress testing your disaster recovery plan, lets maximize the stress. Were talking about chaos engineering, whereby 
systems are periodically disrupted (intentionally) to test their ability to withstand unexpected conditions and events. Could tossing a monkey 
wrench into your IT and security systems help make your organization more resilient? Well, youve come to the right place to find out.
We asked respondents about the extent to which their organizations engage in chaos engineering, and learned it was more common 
than we expected. Of note, we noticed a relationship between this practice and tech integration. Per Figure 23, over two\-thirds of 
organizations for which chaos engineering is standard practice report highly integrated technologies supporting their recovery capabilities. 
Whether integration necessitates or enables chaos engineering is unclear. As with so many things in this field, its probably a bit of both. 
Keep an eye on this emerging disciplineespecially if youre responsible for BCDR in a complex and highly integrated IT environment.

Conclusion and Recommendations
We started with security practices identified as highly effective in a previous study, gathered more 
information via a new survey to learn what makes them most effective, and shared those lessons 
with you. Its our hope that youre leaving this report with several practical tips on how to make your 
cybersecurity program more successful. 
But it never hurts to reflect on the findings of a study like this and hear what others took away from 
them. We asked our experienced CISO Advisory team to weigh in on each of the practice areas 
examined. Weve included their top recommendations below. You can find additional insights and 
takeaways in our Security Outcomes Study blog series.
Proactive 
tech refresh 
The issue of security debt is significant. For the CISO, the way 
forward is to develop a Buy, Hold, Sell strategy. Recognize what 
you have, define an adaptable architecture, reduce dependency 
risk, and implement a review loop for future refresh cycles.

Accurate threat 
detection
Choose the best\-skilled people for your SecOps teams, 
because that matters more than just the number of headcount. If 
you cant get the expertise level you need, automation can help 
you bridge the gap with your junior staff and get results that are 
just as strong as if you had more senior staff.

Prompt disaster 
recovery 
The findings in this report highlight the value of business 
continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, but dont run them 
in isolation from other security functions. The prioritization 
and risk\-ranking of resources should be shared with other 
risk management functions. Similarly, tightly integrate asset 
management and threat management to ensure all teams are 
working off the same playbook.
