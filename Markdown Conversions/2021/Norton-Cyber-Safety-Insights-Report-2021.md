MAY 20212021 NORTON CYBER SAFETY INSIGHTS REPORT 
GLOBAL RESULTSPREPARED BYSurvey MethodThe research was conducted online by The Harris Poll on 
behalf of NortonLifeLock among 10,030 adults (aged 18\+) in 10 
countries. The survey was conducted February 15\-28, 2021 in 
Australia (n\=1,005\), France (n\=1,000\), Germany (n\=1,001\), 
India (n\=1,000\), Italy (n\=1,000\), Japan (n\=1,020\), Netherlands 
(n\=1,000\), New Zealand (n\=1,004\), the United Kingdom 
(n\=1,000\), and the United States (n\=1,000\). Data are weighted 
where necessary to bring them in line with their actual 
proportions in the population; India was weighted to the 
population of those who are online. Weighted variables varied 
by country and included one or more of the following: age, 
gender, raceethnicity, region, education, marital status, internet 
usage, household size, household income, size of place, and 
propensity to be online. A global postweight was applied to 
ensure equal weight of each country in the global total.Population projection estimates cited are calculated based on 
adult population (age 18\+) figures from the U.S. Census 
Bureaus 2021 International Data Base and Pew Research 
Center 2017 Global Attitudes Survey.No estimates of 
theoretical sampling error can be calculated.Throughout the report, references to YOY changes represent 
differences in results from the 2019 Global NLCSIR Study, 
conducted online by the Harris Poll on behalf of NortonLifeLock 
among 10,063 adults (aged 18\+) in 10 countries from
