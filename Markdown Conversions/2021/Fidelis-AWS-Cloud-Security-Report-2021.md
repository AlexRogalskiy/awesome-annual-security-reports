2021AWS CLOUD 
SECURITY 
REPORTINTRODUCTIONCloud security concerns remain high as the adoption of public cloud computing continues to
surge in the wake of the COVID crisis and the resulting massive shift to remote work environments.The 2021 AWS Cloud Security Report is based on a comprehensive survey of 316 cybersecurity
professionals to uncover how AWS user organizations are responding to new security threats in
the cloud, and what tools and best practices cybersecurity leaders are prioritizing in their move 
to the cloud.This years survey saw some significant changes in how organizations manage remediation of 
security and compliance issues with system owners. The reported remediation cadences of real\-
time, ad\-hoc, and before\-audit fire drills all declined between 10 and 13 percentage points since 
1\. While the numbers for quarterly and weekly remediation cadences stayed the same, these 
declines indicate positive process improvements.Key survey findings include:More than nine out of ten cybersecurity professionals (95%) confirm they are extremely tomoderately concerned about public cloud security.Misconfiguration of the cloud platform remains the top concern (71%). Exfiltration of sensitivedata came in second (59%), followed by insecure APIs (54%).Periodic vulnerability and compliance reports are still the primary method for organizations 
(58%) to communicate with system owners about security and compliance issues needing
remediation. This is followed by automatically opened tickets (47%) using tools such as Jira,
ServiceNow, etc.Organizations increasingly embrace hybrid cloud (44%) and multi\-cloud deployments (43%)for planned redundancy because of commitments to legacy applications in traditional data 
centers. Single cloud deployments (11%) continue to diminish in importance. Ninety percent 
of organizations use more than two cloud providers.When selecting a cloud security provider, organizations prioritize cost\-effectiveness (66%),
scalability (52%), ease of deployment (51%), and tools that can be deployed with automation 
(48%) as the top four criteria.We would like to thank CloudPassage for supporting this important industry research project.We hope you find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing
your journey into the cloud.Thank you,Holger SchulzeHolger Schulze

Services, cloud users are ultimately responsible for securing their own workloads in the cloud. When 
asked about their biggest cloud security challenges, cybersecurity professionals in our survey are 
highlighting the risk of data loss and leakage (67%), threats to data privacy (61%), and accidental 
exposure of credentials (49%) as the top three security concerns.What are your biggest cloud security concerns?67%Data loss
