0506091116202IBM SecurityIntroductionIn 2020, IBM Security X\-Force produced a report containing exclusive researchand data on ground\-truth statistics surrounding threat actor targeting of cloudenvironments. Cloud adoption continues to thrive, providing convenience, costsavings, and near\-permanent uptimes for organizations compared toon\-premises infrastructure.At the same time, threat actors continue to target cloud environments regardlessof organization size, and shifting to a cloud model requires a specialized approachdifferent from that of traditional deployments. A key factor to successfuldeploymentand managementof cloud environments is understanding howthreat actors target them, what motivates them, and how to avoid common pitfallsthat leave the cloud vulnerable.This year, we have augmented our 2020 report with new and more robust dataspanning Q2 2020 through Q2 2021\. Data sets we used include dark web analysis,IBM Security X\-Force Red penetration testing data, IBM Security Services metrics,X\-Force Incident Response analysis and X\-Force Threat Intelligence research.These multiple data sources help us better understand how threat actors aregetting into cloud environments, what types of malicious activity are pursued oncetheyre inside and how organizations can prepare and react to security incidentsinvolving their cloud environments more effectively.3IBM SecurityKey takeawaysCloud environments need to be better secured
 Cloud accountsresources on the dark web: A thriving dark web 
market exists for public cloud access, with advertisements for tens ofthousands of cloud accounts and resources for sale.In 71% of cases, threat actors offered Remote Desktop Protocol(RDP) access to cloud resources, enabling attackers to have directaccess and conduct malicious activity.In some cases, account credentials to access cloud environmentswere being sold for a few dollars.Passwords \& Policies: 100% of X\-Force Red penetration tests of 
cloud environments found issues with either passwords or policies.Hardening systems: Based on X\-Force research, two thirds of cloud 
breaches would likely have been prevented by more robust hardeningof systems, such as properly implementing security policies andpatching systems.Cloud vulnerabilities surge: Almost half of the more than 2,500 
disclosed cloud\-related vulnerabilities recorded to date weredisclosed in the last 18 months. While some of this growth canbe attributed to better tracking (cloud vulnerabilities were addedto MITREs CVE standards in January 2020\), this steep growthemphasizes the importance of closely managing this growing riskas more vulnerabilities are exposed.4IBM SecurityKey takeawaysThreat actors target cracks in the armor
Public API policies represented a significant security gap. Two\-thirds 
of the incidents analyzed involved improperly configured ApplicationProgramming Interface (APIs), based on analysis of X\-Force IncidentResponse data of impacted clients.One of the top attack vectors X\-Force observed targeting cloud was 
threat actors pivoting from on\-premises environments into cloud 
environments. This lateral movement was seen in almost a quarter of 
incidents X\-Force responded to in 2020\.IBM estimates that over half of cloud breaches occurred due 
to shadow IT, emerging via unauthorized systems spun up 
against security policies which likely lacked vulnerability and riskassessments, as well as hardened security protocols.Threat actors continue investing in cloud targeting
Cryptominers and ransomware remain the top dropped malware 
into cloud environments, accounting for over half of detected systemcompromises, based on the data analyzed.Threat actors are continuing to pursue clouds in their malwaredevelopment, with new variants of old malware focusing on Dockercontainers, as well as new malware being written in programminglanguages, like Golang, that run cross\-platform.5IBM SecurityA thriving dark web market for 
cloud accessIBM investigated dark and deep web sales of access to cloud accounts, andthe results were sobering. Tens of thousands of accounts and resources werepotentially offered for sale on multiple dark web markets. The vast majority ofthese sales were on markets automatically populated by different info\-stealersand malware opportunistically compromising victims and offering credentials forsale. This bevy of compromised cloud resources highlights how readily availablethese platforms are for threat actors to use for a variety of malicious purposes.The following analysis is based on IBMs dark web research, which, by itsnature, is ever\-changing. However, these data points are representative ofIBMs insights from reviewing multiple dark web marketplaces from July 2020through July 2021\.IBM research uncovered that some cloud accounts are more valuable thanothers, and the following data can help organizations better assess risk byunderstanding how valuable their cloud environments may be to cybercriminalsand estimate the likelihood they could be attacked through them.Many cloud accounts for sale, but not all created equal
Within the timeframe noted above, X\-Force research found almost 30,000 cloudaccounts potentially for sale on dark web marketplaces. Threat actors use avariety of commodity and open\-source info\-stealers and malware to populate themarketplaces listing the majority of these cloud accounts, making it difficult toassess how many actors support this activity.Outside of the botnet\-populated markets, cloud account advertisements in otherdark web forums show prices that range from a few dollars to over $15,000 peraccount access credentials, based on a variety of factors. Those that appearto impact value of accounts for sale include amount of credit on the account,geography and level of account access to the organization that owns that account(root access versus less privileged users).6Section 1IBM SecurityLooking for cloud credits
A number of cloud\-related advertisements on the dark web involved sellingcloud accounts that had access to account credits. Cloud account credits aremonetary value associated with the account that can be used to buy additionalcomputing resources from the cloud provider. For example, an organization mayhave a cloud account with a given provider and fund it with $1,000 worth ofcredits to have the flexibility to quickly scale resources as needed.On average, the price tag for cloud access rose an extra $1 for every $15\-30in credit the account held. An account with $5000 in available credit would beworth about $250 (a ratio of 20:1\). The scheme of account access pricing issimilar to the sale of fraudulent access to bank accounts, whose value increasesthe more money a victim has in the account.Threat actors may buy these compromised accounts for a fraction of the creditthey hold and use them to host their own attacks. Their gain is twofold: theyreduce costs, and they host malicious activity on otherwise legitimate resourceswhich are less likely to have been blacklisted or blocked.Low\-cost access, potential for high impact 
The low price of cloud accounts with high credit value could be the result of afew possibilities. There could be a large supply, or conversely a low demand,for cloud accounts in the dark web market ecosystem. Alternatively, the rateof monetization for credited accounts could be low, making the value of theaccounts similarly depressed. Another reason could be the risk to the buyershould the cloud provider or victim discover the account is compromised andrestrict access to the account. Finally, it is also easy to open some accountswith some monetary amount of credits, reducing the value of the labor put intoacquiring these accounts. Interestingly, threat actors often offer warranties onsold access, promising a refund if the access is no longer available 7 or 14 daysafter sale, indicating access may not have a long lifespan.7IBM SecurityBeyond using cloud environments to launch and scale attacks, stolen accountscan also help attackers gain the initial foothold in an organizations overallenvironment and plot lateral movement across other parts of their networks andmore privileged users.Stolen accounts not only offer adversaries opportunity to launch 
attacks in the cloud, they also provide a way for attackers to gain
a foothold in an organizations overall environment and access 
other parts of the network.Assessing your value to threat actors
The dark web research shows that threat actors remain interested in accessingand taking advantage of cloud accounts, but IBMs research also highlightsthat not all accounts hold the same perceived value to an attacker and someelements may increase the value of an organizations account. For instance,an account based in western Europe with significant credits would be of veryhigh value to threat actors and could increase an organizations threat profile.That sort of account is considered highly sought after and would sell quicklyto cybercriminals.8IBM SecuritySection 2Vulnerabilities in cloud environments 
grow in number and severityDespite cloud environments myriad of security benefits, researchers continueto discover new vulnerabilities that can help attackers break into the cloud. IBMresearch indicates that cloud vulnerabilities are growing in number, currentlytotaling over 2,500 vulnerabilities, a 150% increase in the last five years.Number of cloud vulnerabilities tracked by X\-ForceTotal250020001500100050002006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 20219IBM SecuritySection 2When it comes to vulnerabilities,IBM Security X\-Force Red uses a multifacetedranking algorithm to score the severity of vulnerabilities with a Risk Score. TheRisk Score uses a variety of factors, such as ease of use, level of access grantedand impact on the affected system, to accurately measure vulnerabilities.X\-Force Red data shows that the severity of cloud\-targeting vulnerabilities hasgrown significantly in recent years, likely due to threat actors realization thatorganizations are increasing their use of storing their critical data in multi\-cloudenvironments. Cloud environments are heavily traveled data highways and areappetizing to threat actors due to the target\-rich attack surface.10IBM SecuritySection 3How threat actors are getting into 
cloud environmentsThreat actors continue to access cloud data illicitly, and in this years report IBMbrings a host of new data points to refine our understanding of how they aretargeting organizations cloud assets.150% Cloud vulnerabilities are on the rise, increasing150% over the last five years.Password and policy violations, often from shadow IT, continue to plaguecloud environments. X\-Force Red found that 100% of their penetration testsinto cloud environments in 2021 uncovered issues with at least one of thesetwo components. These two elements trickled down to the most frequentlyobserved initial infection vectors for organizations: improperly configured assets,password spraying and pivoting from on\-premises infrastructure. In addition, APIconfiguration and security issues, remote exploitation and accessing confidentialdata were common ways for threat actors to take advantage of lax security incloud environments.11IBM SecurityIBM Security X\-Force Incident Response insights
The IBM Security X\-Force Incident Response (IR) team analyzed cases over thelast year involving cloud breaches and identified the most commonly exploitedvulnerabilities and misconfigurations: Virtual machines and other resources with default security settings that wereerroneously exposed to the Internet. This included misconfigured platformsand insufficiently enforced network controls that exposed internal servicesdirectly to the Internet, such as the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) onMicrosoft platforms. Another example includes object data stores holding non\-public data that were accessible publicly. Insufficient access control mechanisms, such as a lack of MultifactorAuthentication (MFA) for SaaS solutions and federated services with landingpages accessible from the Internet. This means that with a stolen credentialset, an attacker could authenticate themselves into an account withoutadditional hurdles. Insufficiently segmented virtual networks and promiscuous trust relationshipsbetween on\-premises and cloud computing environments. This means thata compromise in the cloud can enable further lateral movement acrossunderlying systems.X\-Force IR also identified some organizational challenges that indirectly led to thecompromises of cloud computing environments: Enterprises are still learning how to monitor for and detect threats inthe cloud. This challenge is amplified by security policies that dontencompass the cloud, and a shortage of incident response skills thatapply to cloud environments. Organizations do not have the same level of confidence and expertise whenconfiguring security controls in cloud computing environments compared toon\-premises environments.12IBM Security 
Improperly configured resources
Insecure public APIs are a pervasive problem because they are very common andalso allow external tools to interact with cloud functionalities, including access todata. Two thirds of cloud incidents in the data sample related to misconfigured APIkeys that allowed improper access. Similarly, the X\-Force IR team found that overthe last year, API credential exposure through public code repositories frequentlyaccounted for threat actor access into cloud environments.Password spraying, exploited software vulnerabilities and cloud 
deployment misconfigurations are the most common methods 
threat actors use to access cloud environments.When examining cloud\-based cases, X\-Force IR frequently identified unsecuredresources unintentionally exposed to the Internet, such as misconfigured objectstorage services, as a major contributor to observed breaches. This data is furthersupported by the finding that almost two\-thirds of breaches X\-Force researchersobserved were caused by insufficient hardening. IBM estimates that the use ofshadow IT contributed to over half of the incidents analyzed.The three most commonly observed methods for threat actors to compromisecloud environments in cases studied by X\-Force IR were password spraying,software vulnerability, and pivoting from an on\-premise compromise to the cloud.13IBM SecurityPassword spraying
This sort of attack is easily automated and can scale to target manyorganizations at once. X\-Force IR often found that improper permissions furtherexacerbated compromises caused by successful password spraying attacks.Once an attacker managed to use a guessedcompromised password, theirimpact was greater in direct proportion to the users privilege levels.Software vulnerability
X\-Force IR data found that vulnerabilities in software hosted on cloudenvironments often allow attackers to gain an initial foothold into anorganizations environment. This challenge is exacerbated by the many typesand brands of software that are cloud compatible, making securing eachindividual instance difficult for cybersecurity teams.On\-premises to cloud pivot
Another top three infection vector identified by X\-Force IR is threat actorscompromising end\-users or systems hosted on\-premises and pivoting to a cloudenvironment. This type of compromise, which occurred in over 23% of incidentresponses, can allow threat actors to deepen their hold on organizations andcompromise even more organizational resources.Remote exploitation favors RDP
Dark web data further reinforces the effectiveness of remote access compromise.IBMs analysis of dark web markets found that RDP accounted for the accessvector in over 70% of cloud resources offered for sale on the dark web. cPaneland Shell access each took about 4\.5% of the market share, suggesting that RDPaccess greatly exceeds the frequency of other access methods.14IBM SecurityDark web cloud accounts by access type20%4\.5%4\.5%The risk of remote accesscompromise is even more clearfrom X\-Force IR data, whichshows over 20% of studiedincidents were the result of apassword spraying attack.71%RDPcPanelShell Other15IBM SecuritySection 4Threat actors using cloud 
environments for miners, 
ransomware and botnetsX\-Force analyzed data from our IR teams to find how threat actors are usingcloud environments once theyre inside. Based on our analysis of incidents,cryptominers and ransomware were used extensively, accounting for over half ofsystem compromises. Cloud environments are an attractive target for resource\-intensive cryptominers as they can provide scalable resources and processingpower. Also, cloud environments may not receive the same level of oversight ason\-premises servers, which is appealing for threat actors and makes it easierfor noisy malware like DDoS bots and cryptominers to remain undetected forlonger periods.Clouds allow attackers to scale attacks and wipe traces; compromised cloudsallow them to do it for free.Malware focus on DockerAnalyzing malware trends impacting cloud environments, X\-Force IR observedmultiple malware families shifting their sights from targeting generic Linuxsystems to focusing on Docker containers. Attacks on Docker tend to fall intothree categories: registry, host and running container attacks.Some malware families illustrating this shift include XoRDDOS, Groundhog andTsunami. This Docker\-focused push expands beyond just bots, also highlightingthe malicious activity of IoT malware (Kaiji), cryptominers (Xanthe, Kinsing) andother malware strains.16IBM SecurityBotnet malware also saw increased popularity in targeting cloud environmentsthis year. Specifically, exposed Docker servers seem to remain a prominenttarget for botnet malware. Threat actors have also been observed targeting othercontainer platforms in addition to Docker. For example, the Siloscape malwarewas found compromising vulnerable Windows containers, and the containermanagement platform, Kubernetes, is also increasingly targeted by actors suchas TeamTNT.Cloud\-centric malware development on the riseResearch by Intezer highlights threat actors continued investment in evolvingthe code in cryptominers, botnets and ransomware. Conversely, threat actorshave shown little interest in updating banking trojan code so far in 2021\. Theseconclusions align with IBM data indicating that cloud environments are targetedmore heavily by cryptomining malware, with ransomware and botnets continuingto be popular options as well.The following chart shows Intezers research on the level of investment made inupdating and altering malware over the last year by category. Miners show a highpercentage of change, nearly 7% of code used being different year over year,indicating significant investment by actors. Comparatively, banking Trojans have alow percent of changed code, less than 1 percent.17IBM SecurityFrequency of unique code stringsy

UiBankerBotnetMinerRansomwareMalware categoryCryptominersCryptominer infection, highlighted as a key malware used in compromised cloudenvironments in the 2020 Cloud Security Threat Landscape Report, remains atop threat actor goal. Based on Intezer research, one of the ways cryptominersinfect cloud environments is via malicious Docker images. Threat actors, likeTeamTNT, create images that contain malware and, once the threat actor getsaccess to a Docker daemon, they use the image to spin a new container with themalicious image.18IBM SecurityCommand and control shiftsThreat actors continue to use cloud infrastructure to host malicious payloadsand maintain Command and Control (C2\) backend for their operations. While wereported on this activity in last years report, the trend has expanded, with 2021seeing more cloud\-based and web services being leveraged in new ways to avoiddetection. Some illustrative examples include: A cloud\-leveraging backdoor dubbed PowerSlack using popular chatsoftware Slack for C2 communications. A malware family known as Astaroth stored C2 information in YouTubevideo descriptions, potentially hiding suspicious network traffic aslegitimate activity.Fileless malwareEvasive, fileless malware lurking in memory can elude standard detection toolsleaving security teams blind to its presence. Besides using scripts to launchfileless malware, threat actors are now using Ezuri, an opensource crypterand memory loader written in Golang, which makes it even easier to launchundetected malware. Golang is a popular language thats rapidly becoming thelanguage of choice for many cloud native operations and attack frameworks.Cloud platforms allow attackers to scale attacks and wipe traces. 
Compromised clouds allow them to do it for free.19IBM SecuritySection 5Recommendations and best 
practices for preparing for and 
responding to cloud breachesIBM Security X\-Force suggests cloud users should consider implementing amulti\-phased security approach in preparation and response to cloudsecurity incidents.Preparation Where possible use an open and integrated security approach, which canhelp connect the dots between security data that resides across fragmentedcloud environments. Consider security platforms that rely on opentechnologies and allow for tight integrations between tools, such as CloudPak for Security. Consider implementing a zero trust philosophy, including implementingvirtual network segmentation to restrict access to resources and reduce therisk of lateral movement in the case of a compromise. Evaluate trust relationships between on\-premises and cloud environments asa critical part of the security strategy. This is especially important for privateclouds that may interact with other on\-premises assets on a regular basis. Extend monitoring and detection capabilities to cloud environments.Determine and enable audit logging requirements in cloud environments andleverage cloud\-native tools and technologies to monitor for malicious activityand evidence of compromise.IBM Security20 Deploy a bastion host to isolate private cloud network zones from external,less trusted or untrusted networks, including the Internet, to reduce thecloud attack surface and minimize the risk of unauthorized access to cloudresources. Firewalls and load balancers can be helpful in filtering traffic inrelevant gates to the cloud environment. Implement cloud web application defenses, including controls, such as aweb application firewall and vulnerability management for applications andunmanaged cloud resources. Implement and enforce strong access control practices, including theprinciple of least privilege for cloud identities, MFA for privileged accounts,and accounts accessing cloud resources through federated services.Ensure systems are regularly tested for policy compliance. Automate security group privileges and new user creation toleast privilege by default. Modernize Identity and Access Management (IAM) to reducereliance on username and password combinations and combatthreat actor credential theft. Implement provisioning policies and enforce rules to govern the lifecycle ofdeployed resources, including who can provision resources and their types,duration, and the placement of those resources. This control is necessary to reduce the risk of exposing a cloudenvironment to external threats.Use automation extensively to remove human error as possible. Scope penetration testing projects to identify vulnerabilities in cloud\-hostedapplications and environments. Engage in adversary simulation exercises using cloud\-based scenarios to trainand practice effective cloud\-based incident response.21IBM SecurityResponding Implement AI and automate incident response and malware analysis whenfeasible, as this can help reduce response time and overall average cost ofbreaches associated with cloud environments. Preserve forensic artifacts during an investigation by redeploying, notreimaging, affected machines. This will allow for subsequent investigationinto how the breach occurred and what, if anything, else the threat actors mayhave done while in the organizations environment. Leverage threat intelligence during incident response to use knowledge ofthe threat actor to hasten response times and enable more thoroughresponse activities. Ensure your organization has the right tools and personnel for responding toa cloud breach, and that your incident response playbooks are specificallydesigned for cloud\-based breaches. Have surge assistance on speed dial. Even large security teams often needassistance early in the incident response (IR) cycle and during remediationefforts. Having an X\-Force Incident Response Retainer in place can helpminimize delays getting the assistance you need during an attack.22IBM SecurityAbout IBM Security X\-ForceThe X\-Force team is comprised of industry\-leading, highly skilled incidentresponse professionals experienced in investigating compromises of on\-prem,cloud and hybrid cloud environments.
