INTRODUCTION
Cloud security concerns remain high as the adoption of public cloud computing continues 
to surge, especially in the wake of the 2020 COVID crisis and the resulting accelerated shift 
to remote work environments.
The 2021 Cloud Security Report has been produced by Cybersecurity Insiders to explore 
how organizations are responding to the evolving security threats in the cloud and the 
continued shortfall of qualified security staff.
Key survey findings include:
 Despite rapid adoption of cloud computing, security remains a primary issue for cloud 
customers. Virtually all surveyed cybersecurity professionals (96%) confirm they are at 
least moderately concerned about public cloud security, a small increase from last 
years survey.
 We asked survey participants about the biggest barriers holding back faster cloud 
adoption. Among the key barriers to cloud adoption, organizations mention lack of 
qualified staff (39%) as the biggest impediment to faster adoption, followed by data 
security issues (34%) and legal \& regulatory compliance (32%).
 A majority of organizations (57%) expect their cloud security budget to increase over 
the next 12 months. On average, organizations allocate 28% of their security budget to 
cloud security.
 We asked organizations how they would rate their overall security readiness. A majority of 
73% rate their security readiness average or below average. Only half as many say they 
are above average (27%).
 As in previous years, the continuing shortage of not only qualified cybersecurity staff 
but also the lack of security awareness and skills among all employees remains the 
number one security challenge for organizations. To alleviate this shortage, cybersecurity 
professionals agree that 6 out of 10 employees would benefit from security training 
andor certification for their jobs.
Many thanks to (ISC)2for supporting this important research project. We hope you find 
this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing your cloud 
environments.
Thank you,

Despite rapid adoption of cloud computing, security remains a key issue for cloud customers. Virtually 
all surveyed cybersecurity professionals (96%) confirm they are at least moderately concerned about 
public cloud security, a small increase from last years survey.
Cloud users are particularly concerned with risks arising from misconfiguration of the cloud platform, 
exfiltration of sensitive data, and unauthorized access (see page 8\).

The heightened concerns about cloud security have a negative impact on organizations confidence 
in their own cloud security posture. A majority of organizations are at best only moderately confident 
in their cloud security posture (72% \- up from 66% in last years survey). While confidence has been 
declining over time, we still see an alarming degree of overconfidence not supported by the backdrop 
of security incidents and challenges presented in this report.
The biggest challenges causing loss of confidence in cloud security include concerns around data loss
leakage, data privacyconfidentiality, and accidental exposure of credentials (see page 5\).

While cloud providers offer increasingly robust security measures as part of their cloud services, it is the 
customer who is ultimately responsible for securing their workloads in the cloud. The most significant 
cloud security challenges highlighted in our survey are unchanged from last year: data lossleakage (64% 
\* down five percentage points since last year), data privacyconfidentiality (62% \- down four percentage 
points), and accidental exposure of credentials (46% \- up two percentage points).

Organizations are faced with unique security challenges presented by cloud computing. 
Unfortunately, most legacy security tools are not designed for the dynamic, distributed, virtual 
environments of the cloud. Eighty\-one percent of organizations say traditional security solutions 
either dont work at all in cloud environments or have only limited functionality a one percentage 
point improvement from last years survey (82%).

Cloud\-based security solutions offer significant advantages, yet barriers to cloud adoption still 
exist. The survey reveals that the biggest challenges organizations are facing are not about 
technology, but people and processes. Staff expertise and training (53%) continues to rank as the 
highest barrier, followed by lack of integration with on\-premises security technologies (37%) and 
budget challenges (36%).

METHODOLOGY \& DEMOGRAPHICS
The 2021 Cloud Security Report is based on a comprehensive survey of 613 cybersecurity 
professionals conducted in May 2021, to uncover how cloud user organizations are responding to 
security threats in the cloud, and what training, certifications, and best practices IT cybersecurity 
leaders are prioritizing in their move to the cloud. The respondents range from technical executives 
to IT security practitioners, representing a balanced cross\-section of organizations of varying sizes 
across multiple industries.
