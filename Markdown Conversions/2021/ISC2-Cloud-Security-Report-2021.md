SECURITY 
REPORTINTRODUCTIONCloud security concerns remain high as the adoption of public cloud computing continues 
to surge, especially in the wake of the 2020 COVID crisis and the resulting accelerated shift 
to remote work environments.The 2021 Cloud Security Report has been produced by Cybersecurity Insiders to explore 
how organizations are responding to the evolving security threats in the cloud and the 
continued shortfall of qualified security staff.Key survey findings include: Despite rapid adoption of cloud computing, security remains a primary issue for cloud 
customers. Virtually all surveyed cybersecurity professionals (96%) confirm they are at 
least moderately concerned about public cloud security, a small increase from last 
years survey. We asked survey participants about the biggest barriers holding back faster cloud 
adoption. Among the key barriers to cloud adoption, organizations mention lack of 
qualified staff (39%) as the biggest impediment to faster adoption, followed by data 
security issues (34%) and legal \& regulatory compliance (32%). A majority of organizations (57%) expect their cloud security budget to increase over 
the next 12 months. On average, organizations allocate 28% of their security budget to 
cloud security. We asked organizations how they would rate their overall security readiness. A majority of 
73% rate their security readiness average or below average. Only half as many say they 
are above average (27%). As in previous years, the continuing shortage of not only qualified cybersecurity staff 
but also the lack of security awareness and skills among all employees remains the 
number one security challenge for organizations. To alleviate this shortage, cybersecurity 
professionals agree that 6 out of 10 employees would benefit from security training 
andor certification for their jobs.Many thanks to (ISC)2for supporting this important research project. We hope you find 
this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing your cloud 
environments.Thank you,Holger SchulzeHolger Schulze

Cybersecurity Insiders22021 CLOUD SECURITY REPORTAll Rights Reserved.2021 Cybersecurity InsidersSECURITY IN PUBLIC CLOUDSDespite rapid adoption of cloud computing, security remains a key issue for cloud customers. Virtually 
all surveyed cybersecurity professionals (96%) confirm they are at least moderately concerned about 
public cloud security, a small increase from last years survey.Cloud users are particularly concerned with risks arising from misconfiguration of the cloud platform, 
exfiltration of sensitive data, and unauthorized access (see page 8\).How concerned are you about the securityof public clouds?96% Of organizations are moderatelyto extremely concerned

in their own cloud security posture. A majority of organizations are at best only moderately confident 
intheircloudsecurityposture(72%\-upfrom66%inlastyearssurvey).Whileconfidencehasbeen 
declining over time, we still see an alarming degree of overconfidence not supported by the backdrop 
of security incidents and challenges presented in this report.The biggest challenges causing loss of confidence in cloud security include concerns around data loss
leakage, data privacyconfidentiality, and accidental exposure of credentials (see page 5\).How confident are you in your organizations cloud security posture?72% Of organizations are not at allconfident to moderately confident

customer who is ultimately responsible for securing their workloads in the cloud. The most significant 
cloud security challenges highlighted in our survey are unchanged from last year: data lossleakage (64%
