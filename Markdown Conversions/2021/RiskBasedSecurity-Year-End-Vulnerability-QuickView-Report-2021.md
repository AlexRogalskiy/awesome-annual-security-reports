All Rights ReservedVULNERABILITY QUICKVIEW REPORTWelcomeBETTER DATA MATTERSPAGE 3Pre\-pandemic, the vulnerability disclosure landscape tended to follow the same behaviors year\-to\-year. Every quarter,vulnerability disclosures would closely match the count from the same period in the previous year. And then, by year end, thetotal would incrementally exceed the previous years.However, in 2020 Q1 we saw a major and sudden drop of 19\.8% in disclosed vulnerabilities. Out of all the external factors,COVID\-19 was the most likely underlying cause, though nothing could be specifically attributed to the pandemic. Since then,while the total vulnerability count has steadily caught up over the past two years, COVID always appeared to influence thenumbers.Now that we have a full picture of 2021, it looks as if the vulnerability landscape has truly returned to normal. And while thenormalization of the space may seem comforting, for struggling organizations it is not. Vulnerabilities have increased by anoticeable margin, and 2021 can now be credited with the most disclosures on record.There are too many vulnerabilities for organizations to remediate all of them, and they are being disclosed too quickly fororganizations and security teams to keep up with. As usual, this includes CVE NVD. In a world where issues like Log4Shell canappear at any time, organizations need proper vulnerability intelligence in order to make risk\-based decisions. We hope that thisreport demonstrates why Better Data Matters as organizations strive to make those decisions.The 2021 Year End Vulnerability QuickView Report covers vulnerabilities disclosed between January 1, 2021 and December 31,2021\.Key HighlightsRisk Based Securitys VulnDB team aggregated 28,695 vulnerabilities that were disclosed during 2021\. That total is thehighest number on record.Spikes of vulnerability disclosures are occasionally occurring outside of routine Patch Tuesdays, with one such eventresulting in 287 vulnerabilities released in a single day.4,108 vulnerabilities disclosed in 2021 were remotely exploitable, with both a public exploit and documented solutioninformation. By focusing on these issues first, organizations can potentially reduce their risk and immediate workload bynearly 86%.Of the vulnerabilities disclosed during 2021, 29% do not have a CVE ID, while an additional 4% have a CVE ID assignedbut are in RESERVED status. This means that no actionable information about the vulnerability is yet available inCVE NVD.CVE NVDs inability to report on 33% of 2021s vulnerabilities results in a loss of visibility for organizations seeking toreplicate the best practice of focusing on remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that have a public exploit and also adocumented solution.

All Rights ReservedVULNERABILITY QUICKVIEW REPORTBETTER DATA MATTERSPAGE 4Log4Shell: How Big Is It?VIEWPOINT by Brian MartinBy now, the entire world is hopefully aware of what Log4Shell is, and why its a major problem. Since its discovery at the end ofNovember last year, the news has been dominated by headlines touting its impact and how organizations need to pay attention,stop, and remediate Log4j issues. While more and more articles are published, each of them seems to be asking the samequestion, but they all seem unable to give a clear answer: Just how big is Log4Shell?LOG 4 S HE LLI SAME GA \-VU LN E RA B IL IT YIf you are not familiar with what we do at RBS, or what VulnDB is, we can start with the fact that it is the most comprehensive,detailed, and timely source of vulnerability intelligence available on the market. That means the data that we provide ourcustomers is independently aggregated, containing vulnerabilities found in IT, OT, IoT, CoTS, and third party libraries anddependencies.VulnDB details over 280,000 vulnerabilities, including over 91,000 that CVENVD fails to report. This context helps us fully explainand contextualize Log4Shells size and impact, since it has become what we call a mega\-vulnerability.This term describes entries that take up significant bandwidth in our database, and notable mega\-vuln entries include Spectre,POODLE, and Heartbleed. At first glance, it may seem that theres a correlation between size and infamy, but the amount ofattention a vulnerability receives is not the defining factor. Rather, to qualify as a mega\-vulnerability, entries need to havehundreds or even thousands of vulnerability references while affecting a tremendous amount of products and vendors. Theaccompanying charts illustrate how Log4Shell compares among its peer group.Figure 1: Total number of vulnerability references for mega\-vulnerabilities2,0001,5001,0005000HeartbleedShellShockPOODLELogjamSpectre v2Log4Shell Copyright 2022 Risk Based Security, Inc.

But in just a month,Log4Shell has surpassed every other mega\-vulnerability, except for one. At this time, there are over 1,850 vulnerabilityreferences specifically citing Log4Shell and its variants, and they affect over 6,200 vendorsproduct combinations. Of those, over 
275 are unique vendors and 1,677 unique products, meaning that some organizations will likely be impacted several times over.In terms of affected vendors and products, Log4Shell falls slightly behind POODLE. However, if Log4Shell\-related vendoradvisories continue at their current pace, it will likely surpass POODLE within the next month. Nevertheless, the main highlight is 
the incredible amount of Log4Shell references circulating on the web.Out of all 280,000 known vulnerabilities, Log4Shell has the most references by a wide margin. This means that there is anincredible amount of existing information out there. But if thats the case, why are organizations seemingly struggling to mitigateand remediate affected assets?

All Rights ReservedVULNERABILITY QUICKVIEW REPORTBETTER DATA MATTERSPAGE 6VU LN ER AB IL I TYR EF ER E NC ESP R OV ID EA CL EA RE RP ICT UR EO FRIS KDespite the plethora of available information, organizations typically dont have a tool that aggregates every known reference inone place. Vulnerability references provide much needed context for an issue, making it essential for intelligence vendors to 
constantly update their entries (especially Log4Shell) with as many of them as possible.Even though they should, most vulnerability intelligence vendors do not do this. References can contain new information thatcould drastically affect the impact, severity, or solution availability for a given vulnerability. Its common to see a vulnerabilitydisclosed that does not initially have every detail needed to properly triage it. Key details like location, exploitability, or solutioninformation are often found after the vulnerabilitys initial disclosure, and they can come from third\-party sources that are 
unrelated to the originating vendor.As such, vulnerability references play a critical role in contextualizing the risk that an issue poses to organizations. By takingadvantage of a feed that captures them and includes them with the actual vulnerability entry, organizations will be betterinformed if they need additional details specific to a vendor or product. Without references, security teams may question theprovenance of the information in the vulnerability database. And when it comes to Log4Shell, security professionals dont have 
the resources to scour the internet for every mention.But depending on where you get your vulnerability data, hours spent researching Log4j issues will only scratch the surface. Thisis especially true if using publicly sourced data from CVENVD: Copyright 2022 Risk Based Security, Inc. All Rights ReservedVULNERABILITY QUICKVIEW REPORTBETTER DATA MATTERSPAGE 7Although CVE disclaims that its list of vulnerability references should not be considered complete, in the end, what is providedsimply doesnt benefit the end user. On the other hand, VulnDB catalogs over 1,850 Log4Shell references compared to MITREslist of around 100, meaning that CVENVD users will be forced to find as much as 95% of the information that is actually availablethemselves.TH EI MP O RT AN C EOF S TA ND A RD IZ EDD AT ASome skeptics may argue that providing every reference could actually just overload security teams instead of providing abenefit. And in the age of overwhelming amounts of data, this concern has merit. If we were to dump every known reference onorganizations without validating their value, the sheer amount of data may render the information unserviceable. But what ifevery vulnerability reference was sorted based on their contents and relevancy, with options to consume based on affected 
CPEs?This is the importance of an independently researched, comprehensive, and detailed vulnerability database. By being proactivein searching and capturing published details, we are able to provide organizations with a more complete picture, allowing 
security professionals to make informed risk\-based decisions. Copyright 2022 Risk Based Security, Inc.

In the meantime, threat actors across various illicit communities are actively 
discussing ways to exploit and further monetize this vulnerability.Below, we break down the most significant chatter amongst threat actor groups, with a particular focus on deep and dark webforums XSS, Raid, and RAMP.TH EC HA TT E RONXSSIn December, just a few days after the vulnerability was published, Flashpoint analysts identified a thread on the top\-tier Russian\-language hacking forum XSS titled CVE\-2021\-44228 Apache log4j RCE, in which threat actors actively discussed Log4Shell\-related activity, including:Information sharing on proof\-of\-concept (PoC) exploits for Log4ShellContributing to mapping out the Log4Shell attack surfaceProviding information on how to scan for systems vulnerable to Log4ShellWeb application firewall (WAF) evasion payloadsSharing information on how to bypass Cloudflare protections to deliver a Log4Shell exploit payloadSharing updates on patch releases for Log4ShellL OG 4 JA NDG IT HUB: HO WT HR E ATACT O RS WE AP ON IZ EO P EN \-S OU RC ECODEREP OSThe majority of the information shared in the Log4Shell\-related XSS thread identified by Flashpoint is derived from GitHubrepositories. GitHub initially removed repositories containing PoC exploits for Log4Shell to give administrators extra time topatch, given the severity of the vulnerability. Threat actors on XSS were quickly aware of this and in response, posted cloned 
GitHub repositories containing Log4Shell PoC exploits before GitHub had the opportunity to remove them.This activity demonstrates a clear intersection between GitHub and cybercriminal communities. GitHub repositories remain aprimary resource for threat actors, even amid GitHubs attempts to remove repositories containing malicious artifacts. Copyright 2022 Risk Based Security, Inc. All Rights ReservedVULNERABILITY QUICKVIEW REPORTBETTER DATA MATTERSPAGE 9R A IDF O RUM SThreat actors on the English\-language illicit community Raid Forums were actively involved in propagating the following 
information related to Log4Shell:New plugins for popular vulnerability scanning tools tailored toward identifying systems vulnerable to Log4ShellCustom tools designed to scan for systems vulnerable to Log4ShellPoC exploits for Log4ShellRaid Forum admins were aware that chatter about Log4Shell would likely bring increased attention to the forum by lawenforcement and press. As a result, Raid Forum admins consistently removed threads containing information related toLog4Shell. However, similar to GitHub, threat actors on Raid quickly downloaded shared PoC exploits and tools before adminshad the opportunity to remove them. Copyright 2022 Risk Based Security, Inc.

PAGE 10On December 11, within the general chat box of the ransomware forum RAMP, several threat actors said they had not heardfrom the ransomware group LockBit for a while. One individual stated that LockBit is working on Log4Shell but did not provide 
details about the type of work the ransomware collective is allegedly conducting.Notably, LockBits spokesperson on RAMP often openly criticizes RAMP admins, referring to the forum as a cop forum. While 
the aforementioned comment could be a joke, Flashpoint has continued to actively monitor RAMP for any further information. Copyright 2022 Risk Based Security, Inc. All Rights ReservedVULNERABILITY QUICKVIEW REPORTBETTER DATA MATTERS

PAGE 12Vulnerability Trends in 20212021 At A GlanceFigure 1: Number of vulnerabilities disclosed by EOY, in the last five yearsFor two years, COVID has had an observable, yet uncertain impact on vulnerability disclosures. However, 2021 year end datasuggests that the vulnerability landscape is officially returning to normal. While there are many variables that may impact thenumber of vulnerabilities disclosed, in our previous reports we theorized that several pandemic factors likely caused a decreasefrom what is usually seen in similar periods.Since then, a full view of 2021 shows that the total of new vulnerability disclosures has risen significantly in just the latter half ofthe year. Although not definitive proof, the major jump of disclosures suggests that COVID truly had influenced the numbers. It iseasy to imagine that with changes from working in office to working from home, formerly disruptive routines have now becomenormal. Considering how security professionals have mostly adapted to their new environments, as well as the standardincreases we tended to see pre\-pandemic, 2021s jump makes sense. With at least 28,695 vulnerabilities disclosed last year, 2021has the highest number on record so far.However, the most interesting aspect to 2021s total is the short time it took to exceed previous years. In the 2021 Mid Year 2021Report, the difference between 2020 and 2021 was only around 400\. In the second half of the year, that gap then increased byover 3,500\. This is a considerable increase, further lending to the idea that we are seeing the disclosure landscape shake off thepandemic as researchers return to their normal output.

Forthose unfamiliar with this report, it is important to remind readers that these numbers are interesting in terms of volume, butshould not be the basis for any product comparisons or assessments. With that in mind, there is a significant change in 2021 that 
stands out: no Microsoft Windows products! Copyright 2022 Risk Based Security, Inc. All Rights ReservedVULNERABILITY QUICKVIEW REPORTBETTER DATA MATTERS 
PAGE 14Top Vendors by Confirmed VulnerabilitiesTable 2: Top ten vendors by vulnerability disclosures reported by EOY 2021, as compared to 2020NameIBM CorporationSUSEGoogleOracle CorporationMicrosoft CorporationSoftware in the Public Interest, Inc.DellRed HatFedora ProjectCanonicalRank 2021Rank 2020Count 2021Count 202012345678910546127831091,3211,2801,2541,2491,2451,2431,1151,0819958531,4571,4971,3881,7281,5931,2361,2051,5168221,040Continuing the thought from the previous section, in 2019 we didnt include a top product chart, but Microsoft was numberseven on the top vendor list. Then in 2020 four Windows products occupied the Top Ten list. Now that there are no Windowsproducts present on the Top Ten list, have Microsoft vulnerabilities dropped in 2021? The answer is a resounding yes. However,2020 was an unusually bad year for Microsoft, jumping from 944 to 1,593\. If 2020 was an abnormally bad year for Microsoft,then seeing a drop in 2021 would be expected. That, along with a steady increase in vulnerabilities affecting products from other 
vendors, would explain the absence of Microsoft Windows from the product chart above.With the 2021 top vendor chart, we see that despite the drop in Microsoft vulnerabilities, they still reached the number five spot.That tells us that while there were a considerable amount of vulnerabilities in their products, not one Microsoft productmanaged to reach the Top Ten. IBM also experienced this, being number one on the top vendor list while having no productsmake the Top 10 Product list. The reason is simple: for organizations with a sizable product portfolio, the distribution ofvulnerabilities per product evens out and leads to a more nuanced take. Therefore, rather than assuming companies like IBM orOracle are the worst vendors based on their overall vulnerability count, it is crucial to look closer at the product(s) deployed inyour organization. Those product\-specific totals will be of more practical use. Further, depending on the quality of yourvulnerability intelligence, having access to detailed metadata will be extremely useful in developing specific and contextualizedmetrics for your security teams.

In the grand scheme of things, we know there is volatility indisclosures due to some vendors opting to follow Patch Tuesday, where they release patches on a given day of the month. Thischart highlights just how severe that practice has become and the burden it can place on security teams even though it occurs at 
fairly regular intervals.However, this chart shows that there are also unexpected surges of disclosures. Notably, April 20 is not a Patch Tuesday but had287 disclosures putting it the 7th highest for the year, ahead of some Patch Tuesdays. Conversely, we see that disclosures on anygiven day in January didnt make the top ten days. Preparing for the usual days is important, but security teams must stay fluidand be ready to respond to high disclosure days that are out of band. Copyright 2022 Risk Based Security, Inc.

PAGE 16Figure 3: Number of existing vulnerability changes each day in 2021We have talked about the concept of a living database before, and the updates made to VulnDB continue to demonstrate thevalue of that approach. If youre not familiar with the concept, it refers to our belief that vulnerability databases should beconstantly revisited and updated as new details come to light. This graphic shows the number of daily updates made to VulnDBentries. These changes range from adding a reference to adding additional affected products or including a newly released 
solution.Updating previous records is vital because if a vulnerability is disclosed and isnt coordinated with the vendor, it can be days,months or even years before a solution is made available. While your organization may have introduced mitigating controls, it isstill extremely important to install the patch or upgrade when it becomes available. Relying on a one and done vulnerabilitydatabase is not likely to help. While such a solution may provide the original information available at the time of initial disclosure,if it is not updated with subsequently available remediation information then your organization is missing out on crucial dataneeded to truly mitigate vulnerability\-related risk.

PAGE 17Importance of Proper Vulnerability IntelligenceFigure 4: Breakdown of actionable vulnerabilities, by availability and ease of exploitation, disclosed by EOY 2021Weve included the actionable severity chart in our past two reports, as well as in our monthly QuickView Infographics for asimple reason \- it succinctly demonstrates the value of quality vulnerability intelligence. Expecting any organization to triage,prioritize, and then remediate 28,695 vulnerabilities in one year is extremely unrealistic, and without a risk\-based approach, keyissues are more likely to remain unpatched. Copyright 2022 Risk Based Security, Inc. All Rights ReservedVULNERABILITY QUICKVIEW REPORTBETTER DATA MATTERS 
PAGE 18To make the most effective use of time and resources, security teams should first focus on issues that are remotely exploitable,have a public exploit, and have documented solution information. By following this approach, organizations can focus on the4,108 vulnerabilities that fall into this category, potentially reducing their immediate workload by 86% while still addressing themost significant risks with which they are faced. This allows organizations to make an informed decision on how to prioritize theother 24,587, since vulnerabilities with all three stipulations will likely have the most impact, while being the easiest to remediate.However, even though this best practice can bring tangible improvements to the timeliness of any organizations VulnerabilityManagement Program, if your vulnerability intelligence is poor, or is publicly sourced, this model may be theoretical at best.Figure 5: Breakdown of vulnerabilities compared to CVE in 2021RESERVED: 1,315No CVE: 8,215Live CVE: 19,165Figure 5, shows that in 2021, CVE NVD failed to report 8,215 (29%) known disclosed vulnerabilities. In terms of actionability, thisnumber is actually 9,530 (33%) since at the time of writing, 1,315 vulnerabilities are in RESERVED status in CVE. For thoseunfamiliar with the term, RESERVED status vulnerabilities are entries that have been given CVE IDs, but contain no details in theCVE database. As such, even though these entries are counted towards CVEs total, RESERVED status vulnerabilities arecompletely unactionable. Copyright 2022 Risk Based Security, Inc. All Rights ReservedVULNERABILITY QUICKVIEW REPORTBETTER DATA MATTERS 
PAGE 19Figure 6: Breakdown of actionable vulnerabilities, limited to CVE IDs, by availability and ease of exploitation, disclosed by EOY 2021However, CVE NVDs inability to detail 33% has a deeper impact on organizations using publicly\-sourced data to inform theirVulnerability Management Programs. Looking at figures 4 and 6 side\-by\-side shows that either CVE severely lacks coverage onremotely exploitable vulnerabilities, or has great difficulty in identifying remote code execution (RCE) entries. Either way, the endresult is that security teams planning to use publicly sourced data will be unaware of 60% (1,659\) of the vulnerabilities that haveall three stipulations, highlighting the importance of having comprehensive, detailed and timely intelligence.

PAGE 20Despite the vulnerability disclosure landscape shaking off the pandemic, there has been no celebratory fanfare. Now, it is back tobusiness\-as\-usual and that means vulnerability disclosure counts will likely fall back into the pattern of increasing incrementally 
each year. As such, organizations that still adopt the mindset of patch everything will continue to struggle.The good news is that the industry is starting to make big leaps in how it views vulnerability management. Firms like Gartner arecatching on to the inefficiencies caused by reliance on vulnerability scanners, while government agencies like the CybersecurityInfrastructure and Security Agency are pushing for organizations to focus their prioritization on metadata like exploitability, 
rather than severity.All of these movements are educating organizations that it can be possible to proactively manage risk, rather than alwaysreacting to it. As enterprises take the steps in assessing those possibilities, security teams will come to realize that it will all comedown to the quality of data. To make informed risk\-decisions, they will come to understand that comprehensive, actionable, andtimely vulnerability intelligence will be critical, and that it wont be found in the public source.Methodology and TermsVulnDB is derived from a proprietary methodology and daily analysis of thousands of vulnerability sources. Unlike somevulnerability database providers, Risk Based Security is constantly searching for and adding new sources, in addition to workingclosely with customers to ensure coverage of the products they use.VulnDB counts only distinct vulnerabilities. Products sharing the same vulnerable codebase are considered only one uniquevulnerability. We do not consider vulnerabilities that affect multiple products as unique vulnerabilities as some vulnerabilitydatabases do, which artificially inflates their numbers. To be clear, a vulnerability in a third\-party library such as OpenSSL istreated as one vulnerability; the multiple projects using and integrating that code do not constitute additional uniquevulnerabilities, and are not included in any VulnDB counts.
