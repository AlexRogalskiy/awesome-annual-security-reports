2021CLOUD 
SECURITY 
REPORTINTRODUCTIONOrganizations continue to rapidly migrate workloads from datacenters to the cloud, and the 
trend has been accelerating during the recent Covid pandemic.However, cloud security concerns remain high as the adoption of public cloud computing 
continues to surge in the wake of the pandemic and the resulting massive shift to remote work.The 2021 Cloud Security Report is based on a comprehensive global survey of 572 cybersecurity 
professionals to reveal how organizations are responding to security threats in the cloud, and 
what tools and best practices IT cybersecurity leaders are prioritizing in their move to the cloud.Key survey findings include:Most organizations are pursuing a hybrid or multi\-cloud strategy (71%). They are doing this for 
integration of multiple services, scalability, or business continuity reasons. Few companies rely 
on a single cloud deployment (27%) for their business needs.Seventy\-six percent of organizations are using two or more cloud providers.Among the key barriers to faster cloud adoption, survey participants mentioned lack of visibility 
(53%), lack of control (46%), lack of staff resources or expertise (39%), and high cost (35%) as 
the most significant negative factors.Misconfiguration of cloud security remains the biggest cloud security risk according to 67% of 
cybersecurity professionals in our survey. This is followed by exfiltration of sensitive data (59%) 
and tying at 49% are unauthorized access and insecure interfacesAPIs.Multi\-cloud environments add complexity and security challenges. In our survey, organizations 
are most concerned with data protection (58%) followed by a lack of security skills (57%) and 
understanding how different solutions fit together (52%).Seventy\-eight percent of surveyed cybersecurity professionals would find it very helpful to 
extremely helpful to have a single cloud security platform offering a single dashboard while 
allowing for configuration of policies to protect data consistently and comprehensively across 
the cloud.We would like to thank Fortinet for supporting this important industry research project. We hope 
you find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing your journey to 
the cloud.Thank you,Holger SchulzeHolger Schulze
