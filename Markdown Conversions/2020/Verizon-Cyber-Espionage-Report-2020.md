of sources and provides actionable insight into tackling 
cybercrime. Download the 2020 DBIR here:enterprise.verizon.comresourcesreportsdbirVERIS framework
The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing 
(VERIS) framework is a set of metrics designed to provide 
a common language for describing security incidents in 
a structured and repeatable manner. See Appendix A: 
Frameworks for more information and read more about 
VERIS at the link below:veriscommunity.netIncident Classification Patterns
Way back in 2014, to help us better understand and 
communicate the DBIR dataset, we grouped like incidents 
together and called them Incident Classification Patterns. 
Nine patterns comprised the majority of data breaches back 
then and still do so today. These patterns are Crimeware, 
Cyber\-Espionage, Denial of Service, Lost and Stolen Assets, 
Miscellaneous Errors, Payment Card Skimmers, Point of 
Sale, Privilege Misuse, Web Applications and the catchall 
Everything Else. For definitions and summaries, see pages 36 
to 37 of the 2020 DBIR.Cyber\-Espionage pattern
The DBIR Cyber\-Espionage pattern consists of espionage 
enabled via unauthorized network or system access. Nation\-
state or state\-affiliated threat actors looking for those oh\-so\-
juicy secrets primarily fall within this pattern.Welcome to the Cyber\-Espionage Report (CER), 
our first\-ever data\-driven publication on 
advanced cyberattacks. The CER is one of the 
most comprehensive overviews of the Cyber\-
Espionage landscape, offering a deep dive into 
attackers, their motives, their methods and the 
victims who they target. The report serves as a 
tool for better understanding these threat actors 
and what organizations can do to hunt, detect 
and respond to Cyber\-Espionage attacks.This data\-driven report draws from seven years 
of Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 
content as well as more than 14 years of Verizon 
Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC) 
Cyber\-Espionage data breach response 
expertise. The CER serves as a guide for 
cybersecurity professionals looking to bolster 
their organizations cyberdefense posture and 
incident response (IR) capabilities against 
Cyber\-Espionage attacks.More specifically, the CER is an elaboration of 
the Cyber\-Espionage Incident Classification 
Pattern as reflected in the 2020 DBIR. And as 
with the DBIR, we use the same naming 
conventions, terms and definitions. Content in 
this section and in Appendix A: Frameworks 
will help serve as your compass points and 
decoder keys for the rest of the report. Download

Throughout the CER, we present and compare findings 
from a seven\-year perspective (content from the 2014 DBIR 
through the 2020 DBIR): Cyber\-Espionage breaches vs. all 
breaches. At times, we also address findings from a one\-year 
(2020 DBIR) perspective: Cyber\-Espionage breaches vs. all 
breaches. All references to years in this report are in DBIR 
years. For example, 2020 DBIR timeframe refers to DBIR 
year 2020, which in turn correlates with the DBIR dataset 
timeframe of October 2018 to October 2019\.22020\-2021 Cyber\-Espionage ReportContact us.

We align the CER with the North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS), a standard for categorizing 
victim organizations. NAICS uses two\- to six\-digit codes to 
classify organizations. For the CER, we use the two\-digit 
classification level. We provide detailed analyses for seven 
NAICS\-coded industries in Appendix B: Industry dossiers. 
Detailed information on the codes is available here:naics.comsearch\-naics\-codes\-by\-industryNIST Cybersecurity Framework
We use the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) in this report. 
Specifically, we use the five functional areas of Identify, 
Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. See Appendix A:

We also use the 20 Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical 
Security Controls (CSCs) in this report. See Appendix A:

EspionageOverviewWeve conducted all sorts of investigations into cybersecurity 
incidents and data breaches over the years. None have been 
more challenging or perplexing than Cyber\-Espionage attacks.Indeed, Cyber\-Espionage threat actors pose a unique 
challenge to cyberdefenders and incident responders. 
Through advanced techniques and a specific focus, these 
determined threat actors seek to swiftly and stealthily gain 
access to heavily defended environments. Depending on 
their goals, they move laterally through the network, obtain 
targeted access and data, and exit without being detected. 
Or, they stay back and maintain covert persistence.Often, threat actors leave little to no indication of their 
actions, let alone objectives, to avoid detection and thwart 
response efforts. Many choose not to move immediately 
toward their objectives, opting to embed themselves in the 
environment where they persist quietly until their next move.Threat actors conducting espionage can range from nation\-
states (or state\-affiliated entities) to business competitors, 
and in some cases, organized criminal groups. Their targets 
are both the public sector (governments) and private sector 
(corporations). Their reasons? National security, political 
positioning and economic competitive advantage. They seek 
national secrets, intellectual property and sensitive information.The Cyber\-Espionage threat actor modus operandi includes 
gaining unauthorized access, maintaining a low (or no) profile 
and compromising sensitive assets and data. Technology 
makes espionage actors fast, efficient, evasive and difficult to 
attribute. In a nutshell, for the threat actor, Cyber\-Espionage 
is an opportunity with relatively low risk (of being discovered), 
low cost (in terms of resources) and high potential (for payoff).The internet has made us richer, freer, 
connected and informed in ways its founders 
could not have dreamt of. It has also become a 
vector of attack, espionage, crime and harm.George Osborne, British Politician and Newspaper Editor1In seeking to accomplish their objectives, Cyber\-Espionage 
threat actors leverage three primary actions:Social engineering by targeting employees throughactivities such as phishingHacking systems and networks by using backdoors and 
command and control (C2\) functions to establish and 
maintain accessDeploying malicious software, such as Trojan downloaders,to extend their capabilitiesWithin the DBIR dataset, we identified the industries most 
impacted over the past seven years (2014\-2020 DBIR 
timeframe) by Cyber\-Espionage breaches: Education, Financial, 
Information, Manufacturing, Mining \+ Utilities, Professional and 
Public. We focused on these industries because they were the 
most often targeted by these threat actors.Now, if your industry isnt featured within this report, youre 
not off the hook. Cyber\-Espionage threat actors may still 
be targeting your assets and datawe may just not have 
visibility into those attacks. If youve got sensitive, classified, 
proprietary or internal secrets that youd like to keep from 
getting into the wrong hands, turn the page and read on.1Chancellors speech to GCHQ on cybersecurity:public\-sector.co.ukarticleff8fa006cdcd35f4cf9ef4e030e08ff142020\-2021 Cyber\-Espionage ReportThe ever\-evolving
threat landscapeTo stay ahead of cyberdefenders and incident responders, 
Cyber\-Espionage threat actors adjust their tactics, techniques, 
and procedures (TTPs) to embrace new technology, while 
keeping their tried\-and\-true TTPs operational. Here we map 
those TTPs to the VERIS Action varieties to give you an idea of 
what is in and what is out.For example, Phishing (Social) and Backdoor (Malware) have 
served as go\-to Action varieties. Downloader (Malware), 
Capture stored data (Malware) and SpywareKeylogger 
(Malware) have all steadily declined from the 2014 DBIR to 
the 2020 DBIR, with Scan network (Malware) completely 
falling off the top 10 list by the time we get to the 2020 DBIR.Password dumper (Malware), Trojan (Malware) and Remote 
Access Trojan (RAT) (Malware) are new to the 2020 DBIR 
top 10 list. And, while we see that since the 2014 DBIR, 
Backdoor (Malware), Use of backdoor or C2 (Malware) and 
C2 (Malware) have declined percentagewise over the years, 
these Action varieties consistently remain within the top five 
Action varieties for the entire timeframe.0%20%40%60%80%100%Backdoor

When it comes to overall breaches by 
Incident Classification Pattern for the 
2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, we see that 
Cyber\-Espionage ranks sixth (10%)
albeit within close striking distance of 
fourth: Privilege Misuse (ranked fourth 
at 11%) and the sagging Point of Sale 
intrusions (ranked fifth at 11%).It is important to note that these 
Incident Classification Patterns 
are just those known, reported and 
collected. Because Cyber\-Espionage 
attacks are difficult to detect, and 
the breaches within this pattern are 
under\-reported, the number may be 
much higher. The kinds of data stolen 
in Cyber\-Espionage breaches (e.g 
Secrets, Internal or Classified) may notfall under the data types that trigger 
reporting requirements under many 
laws or regulations. Cyber\-Espionage 
threat actors are not typically targeting 
customer data, or even employee data, 
but rather the intellectual property (or 
secret sauce if you will) that would give 
them a leg up in industrial espionage.Web ApplicationsMiscellaneous ErrorsEverything ElsePrivilege MisusePoint of SaleCyber\-EspionageCrimeware0%10%20%30%27%40%50%14%14%11%11%10%7%Lost and Stolen AssetsPayment Card Skimmers4%3%Denial of Service0%Figure \#4:Breaches by pattern (2014\-2020 DBIR; n\=16,090\)0%10%20%30%40%50%31%22%21%Web ApplicationsEverything ElseMiscellaneous ErrorsCrimewarePrivilege MisuseLost and Stolen AssetsCyber\-EspionagePoint of SalePayment Card SkimmersDenial of Service0%4%3%1%1%10%8%Figure \#5:Breaches by pattern (2020 DBIR; n\=3,950\)62020\-2021 Cyber\-Espionage ReportTimelinesAttacker timelines
One of the most effective ways to 
convey the current state of data 
breaches and their impact to victim 
organizations is through temporal 
analysis or timelining.When we look at the DBIR dataset, four 
timelines manifest most clearly. Two 
are from the threat actor standpoint 
Time to Compromise and Time to 
Exfiltrationand two are from the 
cyberdefender and incident responder 
standpointTime to Discovery and 
Time to Containment.Traditionally, for all breaches, the DBIR 
has shown that successful threat actors 
have taken a short amount of time 
(seconds to minutes) to compromise, 
and a relatively short amount of time 
(minutes to days) to exfiltrate data.Victim organizations have taken 
considerably longer (days to months) 
to discover breaches, and an 
uncomfortably long time (hours to 
weeks) to contain breaches.While the timelines for all breaches 
may seem bleak, the same timelines 
for Cyber\-Espionage breaches appear 
even more dire.In the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, for 
Cyber\-Espionage threat actors, the 
Time to Compromise ranges from mere 
seconds to days (91%, the sum of 23%, 
19%, 23% and 26%), while the Time 
to Exfiltration ranges from minutes to 
weeks (88%).80%60%40%20%0%23%23%19%26%4%4%0%80%60%40%20%0%70%15%4%6%2%1%0%Seconds MinutesHoursDaysWeeksMonthsYearsSeconds MinutesHoursDaysWeeksMonthsYearsFigure \#6:Time to Compromise within Cyber\-Espionage breaches

When we look closer, for 
cyberdefenders, we see the Time to 
Discovery within Cyber\-Espionage 
breaches is months to years (69%, the 
sum of 30% and 39%) and the Time 
to Containment ranges from hours to 
weeks (64%, the sum of 10%, 25%
and 29%).The slow, methodical and lengthy 
process employed by threat actors 
versus the correspondingly plodding 
response from cyberdefenders 
speaks to the patience and 
complexity often accompanying 
Cyber\-Espionage attacks.Moreover, this is indicative of the 
threat actors due diligence to not only 
understand their targets environment 
and cybersecurity posture, but also to 
leverage that knowledge to accomplish 
their objectives without detection.Top controlsCSC\-6: Maintenance,Monitoring and Analysis of

threat intelligence to prioritize Cyber\-
Espionage attacks as part of its 
risk management process can start 
by asking questions relevant to the 
organization, such as:How prevalent are Cyber\-Espionageattacks compared to other 
cybersecurity attack patterns?Which Cyber\-Espionage threatactors have been targeting other 
similar organizations? Based on this, 
how likely is the organization to be 
targeted?What assets and data are Cyber\-Espionage threat actors targeting?What are the common TTPs of 
Cyber\-Espionage threat actors?If the answers to these questions 
point to lower risk, does it mean that in 
some industries, such as Healthcare 
or Accommodation, organizations 
should not be concerned with Cyber\-
Espionage? Not at all. This data 
shouldnt be analyzed without context. 
For example, while the number of Cyber\-
Espionage breaches may be lower in 
some industries, the impact of sensitive 
or proprietary data exposure on an 
organization in one of those lesser\-
targeted industries could be substantial.Long story short: Just because your 
organizations industry has not been 
a typical target for Cyber\-Espionage 
threat actors doesnt mean it wont be, 
cant be or hasnt been.To contextualize information for an 
organization, its not uncommon 
to deploy an internal cyber threat 
intelligence team or to wholly or partly 
outsource this capability.Identification tipsIdentify assets, asset owners

Framework introduced in the 2020 
DBIRare publicly available resources 
for formalizing incident and threat 
data. VERIS helps categorize security 
incidents, while CIS CSCs help focus 
on cybersecurity controls.Risk analysis, asset identification and 
incident classification can inform the 
appropriate measures for preventing, 
mitigating, detecting and responding 
to threat actors while also maintaining 
the ability to meet organizational 
business objectives.Develop an organizational understanding 
to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, 
people, assets, data and capabilities.A fundamental requirement for a solid 
information security posture is identifying 
assets before the adversary does. Its 
only when the unknowns become known 
that assets and data can be protected. 
After all, you dont knowand cannot 
protectwhat you dont know.Asset identification is a foundational 
part of the risk management process, 
which aims to define and prioritize risks 
for an organization. Risk managers often 
build matrices listing threats in order 
of severity. They also classify assets 
in terms of confidentiality, integrity and 
availability (referred to as the CIA Triad); 
consider the impact of security breaches 
on the organization; and estimate the 
likelihood of certain incidents.Risk management also requires an 
organization to identify asset owners 
and asset access controls. Asset 
identification and risk management 
should align with the organizations 
business objectives to add value to 
the business and help gain buy\-in 
from decision makers. For example, 
a business\-driven risk management 
strategy could include:Defining objectivesIdentifying assets and threatsSelecting and prioritizing targetsMonitoring and detecting threatsResponding and improving responsecapabilitiesWhile it can be an overwhelming task 
to start from scratch, its possible to 
develop a risk management process 
with smaller objectives by incorporating 
cyber threat intelligence and building 
and refining from there.92020\-2021 Cyber\-Espionage ReportRegionsFor the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, we see Cyber\-Espionage breaches occurring 
most often in the Asia\-Pacific (APAC) region (42%), followed by the Europe, Middle 
East and Africa (EMEA) region (34%), and North America (NA) (23%) region. 
This contrasts sharply with all breaches for this same timeframe, as NA (65%)

select industries
One way to identify industries impacted by Cyber\-
Espionage attacks is by examining overall Cyber\-Espionage 
breach numbers.When we look at how the industries that were featured 
in the 2020 DBIR fared when it comes to Cyber\-
Espionage breaches, we can see that some were more 
strongly impacted than others. In particular, Public (31%), 
Manufacturing (22%) and Professional (11%) topped the list 
for Cyber\-Espionage breaches.This is a good time to point out that the DBIR dataset can 
only tell us what the DBIR dataset knows. The DBIR dataset 
consists of successful, reported and known data breaches 
(and cybersecurity incidents). It doesnt cover undiscovered, 
unreported or uncollected data (i.e data originating outside 
of the 81 contributors to the 2020 DBIR).While we have included more detailed, industry\-specific 
Cyber\-Espionage profiles in Appendix B: Industry dossiers, 
here we provide insight into seven industries. These sectors 
are the most impacted by Cyber\-Espionage breaches over 
the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe and have sufficient content 
for analysis Industry (NAICS \#): Education (61\), Financial (52\), 
Information (51\), Manufacturing (31\-33\), Mining \+ Utilities 
(21\+22\), Professional (54\) and Public (92\).Cyber\-Espionage breaches within all breaches 
of select industries 
Another way to look at industries impacted by Cyber\-
Espionage attacks is the number of Cyber\-Espionage 
breaches within all breaches. For the 2014\-2020 DBIR 
timeframe, we see Manufacturing (35%), Mining \+ Utilities 
(23%), Public (23%), Professional (17%), Education (8%), 
Information (7%) and Financial (2%) for percentage of Cyber\-
Espionage breaches within all breaches by industry.We include more detailed, industry\-specific Cyber\-
Espionage profiles in Appendix B: Industry dossiers. 
Here we provide insight into Breaches by pattern, Cyber\-

Friendly InformationNIST CSF ProtectDevelop and implement appropriate 
safeguards to ensure delivery of
critical services.Sophisticated threat actors often use 
stealthy methods to perpetrate Cyber\-
Espionage attacks. These methods 
can include utilizing compromised 
administrative credentials or 
leveraging dual\-use tools that blend in 
with the environment.These threat actors also deploy custom 
zero\-day malware, which antivirus 
or other alerting software cannot 
detect. From our experience, Cyber\-
Espionage attacksusing sophisticated 
techniques; taking steps to avoid 
detection; and having specific, targeted 
objectivestend to be considerably 
more difficult to detect and investigate 
than other breaches. Nevertheless, 
there are ways to protect against them 
even without specific knowledge of 
their customzero\-day nature.Access control
With administrative permissions and 
a flat (i.e unsegmented) network, a 
threat actor has the freedom to roam. 
Even in segmented networks, a threat 
actor can find their way to the coveted 
data utilizing mapping and other dual\-
use tools. Network segmentation, strict 
access controls, layered security (the 
more access controls the better), a 
least\-privilege practice and multifactor 
authentication for lateral movement into 
critical data areas can all help safeguard 
against Cyber\-Espionage attacks.Awareness and training
As seen in the 2020 DBIR, Cyber\-
Espionage attacks rely heavily on Social 
and Malware combined vectors, using 
Phishing in 81% of the incidents and 
some form of Malware in 92%. Training 
end users to recognize and report social 
attacks, such as phishing or pretexting, 
can help reduce poor outcomes related 
to Cyber\-Espionage attacks.Data security
Secure the data that is most valuable 
and sought after by cyber threat 
actors. Compile a critical data inventory 
and implement access controls and 
monitoring to ensure that data is safe.Processes and procedures
Appropriately crafted corporate 
processes and procedures can help 
protect sensitive data. These should 
cover everything from ensuring that 
user devices are protected with 
encryption and strong passwords to 
restricting the use of public Wi\-Fi and 
determining how sensitive data should 
be securely transmitted. Security 
practices should ensure safe and 
closely controlled access to potentially 
vulnerable data.Maintenance
Cyber\-Espionage risk mitigation is far 
from a set\-it\-and\-forget\-it strategy. 
Regular maintenance should be 
performed to ensure that employees 
follow proper cybersecurity measures 
and procedures so that data is protected.12Protective technology
Some Cyber\-Espionage protective 
measures can be automated. Data 
Leakage Prevention (DLP) solutions 
send alerts when data leaves the 
network. These solutions also offer 
a large variety of features, such as 
detecting or blocking data copied to 
external locations, sent by email, or 
shared using file\-sharing apps and 
sites; preventing protected data from 
being printed; and more. DLP solutions 
can even help identify unencrypted 
data destinations.Protection tipsSafeguard against Cyber\-

In the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, for both Cyber\-Espionage 
breaches and all breaches, the top compromised Attribute is 
Confidentiality (100%). This is by definition. For an incident to 
meet the VERIS requirement for breach classification, it has 
to exhibit a confirmed data compromise, which equates with 
Confidentiality. Thus, all Cyber\-Espionage breaches impact 
the Confidentiality attribute.Integrity (95%) and Availability (1%) follow Confidentiality for 
Cyber\-Espionage breaches. Integrity, because Social actions 
impact the person targeted (Alter behavior), and Malware 
actions impact the asset where it was installed (Software 
installation). These two are among the favorite TTPs of the 
Cyber\-Espionage threat actor. In contrast, most of these 
attacks do not affect the availability of the assetas that

timeframe, we see Software installation (Integrity) (91%), Alter 
behavior (Integrity) (84%) and Secrets (Confidentiality) (73%) 
as top compromised Attribute varieties.In comparing all breaches to Cyber\-Espionage breaches 
during the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, we see Software 
installation (Integrity) (43%) and Alter behavior (Integrity) 
(32%) as first and second for all breaches, which parallels 
Cyber\-Espionage breaches, albeit at a much lower 
percentage. For all breaches, the next two compromised

Significant research and analysis have focused on 
developing models aimed at helping organizations identify, 
measure and monitor the criticality of their assets. These 
models, such as the NIST IR 8179 (Criticality Analysis 
Process Model), are aimed at helping organizations better 
identify, understand and protect their assets.Targeted vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities occupy a huge amount of mindshare in 
information security. Security researchers, independent 
hackers, nation\-state actors, organized criminal groups, 
customers and even employees discover thousands of 
vulnerabilities every year (https:www.cvedetails.com
browse\-by\-date.php).This approach focuses on not only the assets criticality to 
business operations but also the potential damageimpact of 
the loss of the asset. However, many such analytical models 
tend to view assets through a single lens and dont necessarily 
assess them through the prism of Cyber\-Espionage.This nuance is particularly important when two factors are 
considered. First, while the overall significance of Cyber\-
Espionage as a whole is relatively low and appears to be 
decreasing (as indicated in the 2020 DBIR), a by\-industry 
breakdown reveals a more nuanced picture.Reported instances of Cyber\-Espionage breaches 
have been concentrated in certain industries (such as 
Manufacturing, Mining \+ Utilities and Public), while other 
industries (Construction, Real Estate) reported none at all 
(note that this doesnt necessarily mean none occurred 
or that there is no risk for those particular industries, just 
that none were reported where we had visibility). This 
implies that any organizations critical assetsensitive data 
management strategy may need to adjust to the Cyber\-
Espionage risk associated with their particular vertical.Its reasonable to assume that the overall Cyber\-Espionage 
rate suffers from chronic underreporting. Other motivations 
(i.e Financial) lend themselves toward having a more clearly 
identifiable end state. Cyber\-Espionage, on the other hand, 
can potentially be associated with longer attack timelines 
and potentially unending exploitation.In self\-assessing critical assets and sensitive data, 
organizations need to ensure that their assessment criteria 
account for the possibility of Cyber\-Espionage. Specifically, 
their model should address:1\.Overall Cyber\-Espionage risk2\.Assetsdata susceptible to Cyber\-Espionage3\.Safeguards and monitoring to alert onCyber\-Espionage attacks4\.Preventative measures for Cyber\-Espionage, such as:a.Continuous critical assetsensitive data identification,protection and monitoringb.Cyber threat intelligencedark web researchthreat huntingc.Insider Threat Programd.Competitive landscape awareness (i.e unexpected lossof competitive advantage)Some discovered vulnerabilities are reported responsibly 
and some (including their exploit code) are stashed away 
for a multitude of reasons (most of which are nefarious in 
nature). Most application software and firmware vendors 
have established formal programs to release patches on a 
periodic basis, or on an emergency basis depending on the 
severity of the vulnerability.Periodically, organizations discover scores of known 
vulnerabilities within their infrastructure using typical 
vulnerability scanning tools and patch them based on risk 
assessment. However, threat actors leverage a relatively 
small percentage of these vulnerabilities in breaches, as you 
can see in the diagram below from the 2020 DBIR.6%4%2%0%Hacking

not disclosed to vendors or developersmake tackling 
vulnerabilities even harder for impacted organizations. More 
often than not, the exploitation of such vulnerabilities doesnt 
leave credible evidence on the system (although there may 
be some circumstantial evidence left somewhere else).There were times when zero\-day vulnerabilities were for 
sale on the dark web. Due to recent enforcement actions by 
some marketplace operators, the not\-so\-good researchers 
have become less active and have possibly moved to other 
avenues for financial gain and other motives. Weve seen
and continue to seeorganized crime syndicates or nation\-
state and state\-affiliated actors use zero\-day vulnerabilities 
to exploit systems for nefarious purposes.It is important to realize that vulnerabilities are here to stay, 
and the typical patch\-cycle mentality cannot solve this 
problem. A multilayered approach consisting of several 
controls, such as robust risk management, use of strict 
least\-privilege principle, application whitelisting, threat 
hunting and deception\-based detection techniques, can
help protect against the invisible monster.17

The top compromised Data varieties for Cyber\-Espionage 
breaches for the 2020 DBIR timeframe are data types that 
fall outside regulatory reporting requirements: Credentials 
(56%), Secrets (49%), Internal (12%) and Classified (7%), with 
Bank (6%), Source code (6%) and Digital certificate (6%) all 
statistically tied for fifth. In addition, much like the 2014\-2020 
DBIR timeframe, this makes sense for Cyber\-Espionage 
breaches, as threat actors would seek these Data varieties for 
competitive gain.All breachesShort term
When we look at compromised Data varieties for the 2020 
DBIR timeframe, a different story emerges for all breaches. 
We find Personal (58%), Credentials (41%), Internal (17%) and 
Medical (16%) as the top compromised Data varieties for all 
breaches, with Payment (12%) and Bank (11%) bringing up the 
rear. With the exception of Credentials, these Data varieties 
align with regulatory reporting for data breaches in general.182020\-2021 Cyber\-Espionage Report0%20%40%60%80%100%0%20%40%60%80%100%30%22%19%SecretsInternalCredentialsSystemClassified9%Personal

these data types most frequently: Secrets (75%), Internal

these data types are ostensibly sought after by threat actors

For all breaches, we see Credentials (31%), Personal (31%), 
Payment (23%), Medical (13%) and Internal (13%) as more 
valuable targets for compromised Data varieties. Moreover, 
this is understandable because, with the exception of 
Credentials and Internal, these Data varieties fall within the 
realm of mandatory regulatory reporting requirements for

activities to identify the occurrence of a 
cybersecurity event.The 2016 DBIR reported that, in general, 
victim organizations seldom detect data 
breaches. Rather, external sources are 
more likely to make the discovery. This 
trend remains the same even years later 
in the 2020 DBIR and is especially true 
for Cyber\-Espionage breaches in the 
2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe. These 
breaches tend to allow the adversary to 
siphon as much information as possible 
from their victim for as long as possible 
while remaining undetected.The questions for organizations in 
2016 were how could an organization 
improve its Time to Discovery trend? 
How can it avoid relying mostly on 
external sources that lie beyond its 
control? How can it detect intrusions 
as they occur if not before they occur? 
These questions led to innovation in the 
detection\-technology space, which we 
cover later in the report.However, despite some organizations 
adopting these new technologies, the 
problem remains. A possible explanation 
is that these new techniques often 
rely on the organization having first 
covered the basics, such as determining 
network activity baselines, defining 
cybersecurity incidents and specifying 
alert thresholds, which isnt always
the case.Detection tipsBefore investing in new technology, 
an organization should verify that its 
cybersecurity foundations are solid. 
Security strategists can accomplish 
this by adopting the Capability Maturity 
Model (CMM) strategy, originally 
developed to improve software 
development processes. The CMM 
relies on measuring, controlling and 
regularly updating documentation and 
processes to limit the unknowns.During VTRAC data breach 
investigations, crucial data is often 
unavailable. Gaps come in the form 
of missing log files, undocumented 
systems, poor data accessibility, 
network traffic flows, operational 
practices, and underestimated or under\-
documented data\-sensitivity issues.This lack of information not only 
hinders a data breach investigation and 
subsequent incident response efforts, 
but it also creates golden opportunities 
for the adversary to easily find and 
access potentially sensitive information.One way to address the gap between 
compromise and detection speed in 
breaches involving adversaries using 
evasion tactics is to enhance detection 
capabilities while keeping up with new 
evasion techniques. Organizations 
should develop defensive capabilities, 
such as counterespionage deception 
techniques, specifically to reflect these 
emerging evasion TTPs.The last few years have seen the 
development and enhancement of 
both network and host detection and 
prevention systems. These have been 
re\-envisioned as Endpoint Detection 
and Response (EDR) and Network 
Detection and Response (NDR) 
solutions. Event and telemetry data 
from these systems typically roll up 
into Security Information and Event 
Management (SIEM) and Security 
Orchestration, Automation, and 
Response (SOAR) solutions to trigger 
response and containment, eradication, 
remediation and recovery actions.These technologies have moved 
beyond outdated signature\-based 
detection toward behavior\-pattern 
detection enhanced with cyber threat 
intelligence, automation, and machine 
learning or artificial intelligence (i.e 
statistical analysis and anomaly 
detection). Solutions also facilitate 
proactive analysis, often referred to as 
security health checks.Its also important to remember that 
having the best technology in your 
arsenal doesnt help unless you have 
equally mature processes as well as 
suitably skilled and trained personnel to 
manage it effectively.Verify that the organizations cybersecurity foundationsDevelop counterespionage detection techniques thatare solid by adopting the CMM strategyevolve to reflect emerging evasion TTPsEnsure the availability of crucial data by reducing

In terms of top Discovery methods for Cyber\-Espionage 
breaches in the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, we see the 
top two methods as Suspicious traffic (48%) and Antivirus 
(23%), with Emergency response team a distant third (7%). 
This contrasts sharply with the top Discovery methods for 
all breaches for the same timeframe, in which we see Law 
enforcement (28%), Fraud detection (19%) and Customer 
(15%), respectively, at the top.When we put on the threat actor motive filter, this makes 
sense. Data breaches overall are dominated by the Financial 
motive, whereas Cyber\-Espionage breaches align with the 
Espionage motive, which is much more targeted in its approach.A factor at play here is that the Financial motive threat 
actor has to contend with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) 
Common Point of Purchase (CPP) fraud detection system. 
There is no corresponding detection service looking for theft 
of trade secrets, which contributes to longer discovery times.Top controlsCSC\-6: Maintenance, Monitoring and Analysis ofAudit LogsCSC\-8: Malware DefensesCSC\-12: Boundary DefenseCSC\-19: Incident Response and Management212020\-2021 Cyber\-Espionage Report100%80%60%40%20%0%ExternalInternalMultiple

For the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, External actors have 
dominated Actor types, ranging from 69% to 88% over this 
timeframe, with Internal actors a distant second, ranging from 
12% to 34% over the same timeframe.When we look at Cyber\-Espionage breaches for the 2014\-
2020 DBIR timeframe, External actors (State\-affiliated, 
Nation\-state, Organized crime, Former employee and 
Competitor combined) are at 100%. This makes sense, as 
within VERIS, Cyber\-Espionage threat actors are coded as 
External actors in all breaches.Actor varieties
Attempting to identify Actor varieties is an immense 
challenge in cyberspace. Threat actors go to great lengths 
to maintain anonymity, obfuscate their activities and 
impede identification using bogus IP addresses (even 
MAC addresses can be spoofed), domain names, email 
addresses, file names and malware tools, among other 
indicators of compromise (IoCs).The top Actor varieties in Cyber\-Espionage breaches for the 
2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe are State\-affiliated (85%), Nation\-
state (8%), Organized crime (4%) and Former employee (2%). 
This should be no surprise, as State\-affiliated and Nation\-state 
threat actors align more with the Espionage motive.For all breaches during this same timeframe, we see a bit of 
a different picture, with Organized crime (59%) dominating 
the list of Actor varieties, followed by State\-affiliated (13%), 
Unaffiliated (7%), and then End\-user (6%) and System admin 
(4%). Organized crime has been identified mainly with the 
Financial motive, one that continues to dominate our DBIR 
dataset for all breaches over the years.Threat actors definedThreat actors are entities that cause or contribute 
to a data breach or cybersecurity incident. External 
actors originate from outside the organization 
and its network of partners and typically have no 
trust or privilege granted to them. Internal actors 
originate from within the organization and enjoy 
some level of trust and privilege. Partner actors 
include any third party that shares a business 
relationship with the organization and thus enjoys 
some level of trust and privilege.222020\-2021 Cyber\-Espionage ReportThe labyrinth:
How attribution could be wrongDigital forensic investigations should 
ideally answer the five Ws (who, what, 
where, when and why) and one H (How) 
questions. However, challenges related 
to the availability and granularity of 
detail in evidentiary data can leave 
many questions unanswered.Cyberattack attribution in particular 
is meant to address the Who and 
Why questions. Investigators focus 
on threat actor TTPs, consult cyber 
threat intelligence reports and review 
IoCs to root out perpetrators and 
mount a defense.However, IoCs such as IP addresses, 
domain names, file names, malware 
behavior and binary code sections 
can be misleading. Consequently, 
investigators shouldnt rely only on 
these to make a cyberattack attribution.The current geopolitical climate, 
recent pandemic and heightened 
trade tensions provide a conducive 
environment for cyberattack 
misattribution. This is especially true for 
Cyber\-Espionage attacks that typically 
involve tactics such as leveraging 
covert TTPs and false flags. Threat 
actors associated with these attacks 
are attempting to thwart detection and 
response efforts, as well as conceal 
attack attribution for political and 
national security purposes.On top of that, Tor (The Onion 
Router) networks, the dark web, 
business infrastructures that lack 
security, and privacy legislations in 
certain countries further complicate 
attribution. Using cryptocurrencies 
(especially altcoins, such as Monero, 
offering anonymity) or services, such 
as coin mixers, makes tracing the 
origin of attacks more difficult.Another very important obstacle is the 
extreme difficulty of prosecuting cross\-
border cybercriminals, which nation\-
state actors inherently protect. The lack 
of local legal statutes, regulations or 
reliable evidence lessens deterrence 
and may even motivate threat actors.Finally, it should be noted that 
attribution is a multidimensional 
challenge. Attributionaside from 
forensic evidencedepends on 
various types of intelligence, including 
forensics evidence; Technical 
Intelligence (TECHINT); Human 
Intelligence (HUMINT); Signals 
Intelligence (SIGINT); Open Source 
Intelligence (OSINT); and adversarial 
tradecraft (i.e TTPs), infrastructure 
and intent. All dimensions must align
for sound and reliable attribution.23

For the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, annually, we see 
Financial motive underlying breaches between 67% and 86% 
of the time and Espionage motive as the driver between 10% 
and 26% of the time.Given their nature (e.g stealthy tactics, specific targeting), 
Espionage attacks can be difficult to detect and identify as 
an actual Espionage\-related attack (given scant IoCs and 
other details).Motives
Within the dataset that shows all breaches, for both the 
2020 DBIR and 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframes, we see 
Financial motive as the overwhelming Actor motive (86% 
and 76%, respectively), with Espionage the second highest 
motive (10% and 18% respectively).Actor motives consolidated in The Rest (6%) for the 
2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe include Fun (3%), Grudge (1%), 
Convenience (1%) and Ideology (1%).Whereas Financial attacksif not detected while occurring or 
soon thereaftereventually become apparent when money 
goes missing. At that point, the Financial motive, if not already 
ascertained, can be determined.100%80%60%40%20%0%FinancialEspionage2014

The best defense is a great offense.Additional actions
Consider taking these additional 
protective measures:Assign all users separate, unique 
accounts. Dont use generic or 
shared accounts or passwordsBlock outbound, unrestricted internet 
access from server infrastructure. 
This is intended to prevent 
adversaries from exfiltrating data to 
known or unknown IP addresses and 
using services, protocols or ports in 
an unauthorized mannerCreate adequate networksegmentation to separate virtual local 
area networks (VLANs) from internet\-
facing infrastructure, server farms, 
internal networks and administrator 
networks. Appropriate segmentation 
makes it difficult for an adversary to 
move laterally within the networkRestrict PowerShell and other native 
scripting to only individuals with an 
acknowledged legitimate use and track 
the assignment of such privilegesProhibit interactive log\-ons usingservice accounts or break\-the\-glass

SIEM to trigger an alert to the security 
operations team whenever an attempt 
is made to log on to any system 
interactively using service accountsRequire two\-factor authentication 
for all administrative access to 
infrastructure components. This 
implementation will mitigate the 
impersonation risk and prohibit access 
using unauthorized credentialsThreat hunting \|
Behavioral analysis
Advanced threat actors attempt 
to blend in to evade automated 
cyberdefense measures. With the rise 
of zero\-day and fileless attacks, its 
harder than ever to protect endpoints 
with confidence. In addition, preventing 
and detecting these attacks can be a 
huge drain on organizational resources.Compromise happens within minutes 
to hours, as we have seen consistently 
over the years in the DBIR. This is mainly 
attributable to the use of email and 
web\-based threat vectors coupled with 
heavily automated attacks (nowadays 
also powered by machine learning).Visibility and detection speed 
techniques play a very important role 
in this never\-ending battle against 
cyberattacks. It is imperative that 
detection measures be a combination 
of signature\- and behavior\-based 
techniques. One cannot manage or 
defend against unknown threats using 
traditional means. Effective, efficient 
and multilayered threat hunting can 
help give you a significant advantage in 
detecting these unknowns.Threat hunting consists of:1\.Making hypothesis\-driven exercises2\.Proactively and reactively searchingfor threat actor activities3\.Effectively eliminating, or at leastreducing, false negatives (indicators 
that signature\-based detection 
approaches can overlook)4\.Assuming that threat actors arealready present in the infrastructure5\.Placing a strong focus on indicators 
of attack (IoAs) combined with IoCs6\.Prioritizing overall threat types and 
looking for the most dangerous 
ones first25
252020\-2021 Cyber\-Espionage Report2020\-2021 Cyber\-Espionage Report06TradecraftNIST CSF RespondDevelop and implement appropriate 
activities to take action regarding a 
detected cybersecurity incident.Investigating Cyber\-Espionage 
breaches differs from researching 
cybersecurity incidents. Thus, incident 
responders and forensic investigators 
may not initially realize that an 
attack is targeted and the motive is 
intellectual property theft. Its only as 
the investigation progresses and the 
complexity of the attack becomes 
apparent that investigators take a 
slightly different approach.Before the investigation, investigators 
collect technical information such 
as network topology. Investigators 
also interview network and system 
administrators to scope out the incident 
and identify possible intrusion channels. 
In addition, investigators collect in\-
scope volatile data and system images 
plus all associated logs from various 
sources, such as system (including 
PowerShell or System Monitor), SIEM 
and proxy logs.Understanding how the incident was 
detected helps an investigator triage 
and scope, as Cyber\-Espionage attacks 
generally involve multiple systems 
and other infrastructure components. 
In\-scope data sources require periodic 
review and re\-scoping throughout the 
IR lifecycle.One key objective for a Cyber\-
Espionage investigation is to identify 
patient zero and determine how 
the adversary gained access to the 
infrastructure. Common methods of 
entry include exploiting an internet\-
facing application, applying brute force 
to an account, using phishing email to 
gain an initial foothold or compromising 
the human factortrust.During Cyber\-Espionage investigations, 
it is common to find phishing (or 
targeted phishing) emails as the initial 
vector. These emails usually are well 
crafted (industry specific) to lure the 
recipients either to click a URL hosting 
a malicious or lookalike website, or 
to open an attachment that executes 
malicious software. In some cases, 
obtaining user credentials is the goal for 
follow\-on use in the initial penetration.Based on the information received 
from the impacted organization and 
the results of the initial analysis, the 
threat\-intelligence team endeavors 
to identify an associated threat actor. 
By identifying its goals, capabilities 
and methods, the team can develop 
attack modelsbased on the most 
common and most lethal cybersecurity 
incidentsto prepare for and better 
respond to cybersecurity attacks.When combined with organization 
profiling, unique risk identification is 
possible and can provide valuable 
assistance to the investigation to find 
in\-scope compromised or affected 
infrastructure components.Sometimes, the cyber threat 
intelligence team encounters stolen 
data and credentials being traded by 
cybercriminals, and this data is all the 
adversary needs for further attacks on 
an organization.One key challenge faced during 
Cyber\-Espionage investigations is the 
identification of compromised systems. 
Many Cyber\-Espionage attacks are 
associated with advanced persistent 
attacksmultistaged attacks that 
involve lateral movement.Identifying compromised assets or 
assets posing as intermediaries can 
be a challenge. Cyber\-Espionage 
attacks employ specifically created 
malware that causes multiple layers 
of obfuscation and malware variants, 
making IoC\-based detection within the 
enterprise environment difficult.A further challenge is that Cyber\-
Espionage attacks often leverage 
legitimate credentials and legitimate 
dual\-use tools, such as network 
mapping or remote access software 
already being used in the environment. 
This makes it extremely difficult to 
differentiate between malicious actions 
and legitimate administrative tasks.To circumvent challenges, EDR 
and NDR solutions help identify 
abnormalities and build the IoCs 
necessary to locate affected systems 
and infrastructure components.Response tipsLearn how the incident was detected to help

Honeypots, honeytokens, honeynetsYou can extend the simple document 
and honeytoken approach to a system 
honeypot, such as a file server hosting 
the document. This allows security 
administrators to detect an intrusion 
before the adversary reaches the 
honeytoken document. Again, the 
system must pose as a standard file 
server to lure the adversary.If we extend this concept, we reach the 
honeynet level, a network of honeypots.A honeypot is a system, or several 
networked systems, that waits for 
unsolicited requests. More specifically, 
honeypots observe unsolicited 
activity, attract possible threat 
actors and document their methods. 
Honeypots are effective for discovering 
opportunistic attacks, large\-scale 
probes or computer worms, brute 
force authentication, misconfiguration, 
vulnerability exploits and web 
application attacks.Information security researchers 
use honeypot technologies for 
counterespionage attacks because 
they can mimic the organizations 
production environment but with fake 
believable data as bait.The purpose of honeypot technology 
isnt only to detect a threat actor, but 
to also:Slow down the threat actorLure threat actors away fromsensitive dataCollect information on the threatactorGain visibility into gaps inperimeter defensesHoneypot technology requires the 
organization to have fundamental 
information security controls already 
in place. To reach this higher maturity 
level, organizations should:Identify crown jewels that the threatactor would potentially seekEnable monitoring, logging,alerting and response processes in 
associated infrastructureIntegrate information security 
infrastructure componentsTrain employees on
incident responseSegment the network and be able toredirect traffic easily, if neededOnce the maturity requirements are 
fulfilled, the next step is to start small 
and scale up gradually. Similar to 
building an SIEM infrastructure, it is 
best to deploy deception solutions 
based on use cases. Start with a high\-
risk scenario you want to address and 
build from there.The scenario can be based on either risk 
analysis or real incidents. When using 
real incident scenarios, it is important to 
leverage cyber threat intelligence.Start with your top identified Cyber\-
Espionage risk. Determine how 
the sensitive data is stored (digital 
documents, database), where it is 
stored (file server, database server, web 
application) and what the data looks like.If sensitive data is stored in documents, 
for instance, create realistic documents 
with fake data. Then consider using a 
honeytoken with a canary value that, if 
used, will trigger a security alert.A honeytoken can be as simple as 
an unused official email address, a 
link to an unused server, specific 
keywords or records. If a honeytoken 
is used, it should trigger an alert in 
the security\-monitoring infrastructure. 
Honeytokens can also be extended 
to other components such as specific 
database records or invalid or unused 
user accounts.Some organizations have gone further 
by intentionally using administrative 
account names such as administrator 
or adm\-yinzer as honeytokens. These 
honeytokens can be made to appear 
even more enticing by associating 
them with critical servers such as 
domain controllers using DC in the 
system name.27

Actions are measures that threat actors take to cause or 
contribute to an incident. They answer the question,
What tactics (actions) were used to affect an asset?For the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, the top three Actions 
align for Cyber\-Espionage breaches and all breaches;however, the order in which they appear differs. For Cyber\-
Espionage breaches, the top Actions are Malware (90%), 
Social (83%) and Hacking (80%). For all breaches, the top 
Actions are Hacking (56%), Malware (39%) and Social (29%).This implies more of a reliance on Malware and Social Actions 
for Cyber\-Espionage threat actors than for all breach Actions.0%20%40%60%80%100%0%20%40%60%80%100%MalwareSocialHackingMisuse2%Physical0%Error0%Environmental0%56%39%29%90%83%80%HackingMalwareSocialError16%Misuse11%Physical6%Environmental0%Figure \#39: Actions within Cyber\-Espionage breaches

malicious or notcontrary to their original intentions.Within the limited data for Cyber\-Espionage breaches for 
the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, we find for Misuse action 
varieties that Privilege abuse (59%) and Data mishandling 
(32%) are far ahead of the three\-way tie between Email 
misuse (14%), Unapproved hardware (14%) and Unapproved

Hacking action varieties are all attempts to intentionally access or harm information 
assets without (or exceeding) authorization by circumventing or thwarting logical 
security mechanisms.During the 2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe, the top Hacking action varieties for Cyber\-
Espionage breaches are Use of backdoor or C2 (86%), Use of stolen creds (30%), 
Brute force (12%) and Exploit vuln (9%).During this same timeframe, for all breaches, the top four Hacking action varieties 
align with the Cyber\-Espionage breaches, albeit in a different order of primacy: 
Use of stolen creds (63%), Use of backdoor or C2 (39%), Brute force (18%) and 
Exploit vuln (9%).Of the four top Hacking action varieties, Cyber\-Espionage breaches rely more 
heavily on the sneakier Use of backdoor or C2, whereas all breaches rely 
extensively on the matter\-of\-fact Use of stolen creds.Top controlsCSC\-4: Controlled Use of

Malware actions are any malicious software, script or code 
that runs on a device to alter its state or function without the 
owners informed consent.For Cyber\-Espionage breaches during the 2014\-2020 DBIR 
timeframe, we see Cyber\-Espionage threat actors place 
significantly more value on the top two Malware action 
varieties, Backdoor (78%) and C2 (77%), than the next four 
Malware action varieties: Downloader (40%), Capture stored 
data (40%), SpywareKeylogger (33%) and Export data (32%).During the same timeframe, the top Malware action varieties 
for all breaches group together more closely: C2 (48%), 
Export data (42%), SpywareKeylogger (40%), RAM scraper 
(35%) and Backdoor (25%).For top Malware action varieties, Cyber\-Espionage threat 
actors place significant value in Backdoor and C2, while all

varieties by External actor with Espionage motive within 
breaches are Phishing (81%), Use of backdoor or C2 (60%), 
Backdoor (54%) and C2 (53%). Capture stored data (27%) 
and Downloader (27%) are tied for a distant fifth.This high percentage across four Action varieties (which can

framework aspectsMITRE ATT\&CK is a globally accessible 
knowledge base of adversary tactics 
and techniques based on real\-world 
observations. In the 2020 DBIR, we 
mapped VERIS (threat actions) to 
MITRE ATT\&CK. If your organization 
uses MITRE ATT\&CK, here are some 
questions to ask:How was initial access gained? (e.g 
known vulnerability exploitation, drive\-
by download, phishing attack vector, 
compromised credential access)How was persistence achieved?(e.g new accounts, hooking, startup 
item, registry run keys, batch jobs, 
scheduled tasks)How did the adversary escalateprivileges? (e.g account bypass, 
Dynamic Link Library hijacking, 
vulnerability exploitation,
process injection)Were there any indications of lateral 
movement? (e.g remote service 
exploitation, local admin account
log\-ons, pass the hash vs. pass the 
ticket, network sniffing)How did C2 servers access the 
environment? (e.g unknown or 
unexpected traffic or http, https, ftp, 
etc.; data encoding or obfuscation; 
domain fronting; uncommon ports)EDR and NDR technologiesNDR deployments give investigators 
access to large amounts of data, which 
they can index for rapid searches to 
identify anomalies. This can lead to the 
discovery of other unidentified, infected 
infrastructure components and help 
build up the IoCs needed to find more 
impacted and compromised systems.EDR and NDR solutions can be efficient 
toolsets for organizations to leverage 
during an incident and hasten the return 
to normal business operation.Using an EDR solution during a 
Cyber\-Espionage investigation can 
significantly increase the effectiveness 
of the investigation. This technology 
can provide much needed visibility 
into understanding adversary 
TTPs, monitoring lateral movement, 
identifying persistence mechanisms 
and expediting the return to normal 
business operations.EDR technology can accelerate the 
speed of the investigation by utilizing 
behavioral detection tactics combined 
with IoC\-based searches (in near real 
time) within the infrastructure, leading 
to further identification of compromised 
or affected system components.Network traffic can provide keen insight 
into threat actors breach defenses and 
impact assets and data. Utilizing NDR 
solutions gives organizations in\-depth 
visibility into the network, which helps 
network forensics investigators gain 
insights into packet\-level activities. 
Such insight helps investigators identify 
new IoCs using behavioral analysis and 
heuristics techniques.36

Vocabulary for Event Recording 
and Incident Sharing (VERIS) is a 
set of metrics designed to provide 
a common language for describing 
security incidents in a structured and 
repeatable manner.VERIS was crafted as a response to 
one of the most critical and persistent 
challenges in the security industrya 
lack of quality information.VERIS targets this problem by helping 
organizations to collect useful incident\-
related information and to share 
itanonymously and responsibly
with others. The overall goal is to 
lay a foundation from which we can 
constructively and cooperatively learn 
from our experiences to better measure 
and manage risk.A4 threat model
VERIS employs the A4 threat model, 
which was developed originally by the 
Verizon RISK Team (now known as 
VTRAC). In the A4 threat model, an 
incident is viewed as a series of events 
that adversely affect the information 
assets of an organization. The A4 
threat model elements are:Actors: Whose actions affectedthe asset?Actions: What actions affectedthe asset?Assets: Which assets were affected?Attributes: How were assets affected?Threat actors
Entities causing or contributing to an 
incident are referred to as threat actors.External actors: External threats 
originate from sources outside of 
the organization and its network of 
partners. Typically, no trust or privilege 
is implied for external entities.Internal actors: Internal threats 
originate from within the organization. 
Insiders are trusted and privileged 
(some more than others).Partner actors: Partners include any 
third party that shares a business 
relationship with the organization. Some 
level of trust and privilege is usually 
implied between business partners and 
the organizations.Threat actions
Threat actors conduct threat actions 
to cause or contribute to an incident. 
VERIS uses seven primary categories 
for threat actions: Malware, Hacking, 
Social, Misuse, Physical, Error and 
Environmental. For this report, we 
focus on four: Misuse, Social, Hacking 
and Malware.Misuse: Using entrusted organizational 
resources or privileges for any 
purpose or manner contrary to that 
which was intendedSocial: Employing tactics such as 
deception, manipulation and intimidation 
to exploit the human element, or users, 
of information assetsHacking: Attempting to intentionally 
access or harm information assets, 
without (or exceeding) authorization, 
by circumventing or thwarting logical 
security mechanismsMalware: Any malicious software, script 
or code that runs on a device to alter 
its state or function without the owners 
informed consentAssets and attributes
A compromised asset is one that 
suffers from any loss of confidentiality
possession, integrityauthenticity or 
availabilityutility (primary security 
attributes of the expanded CIA Triad). An 
incident can involve multiple assets and 
affect multiple attributes (each of which 
contains different metrics) of those assets.Additional resources

Based in our previous proactive IR 
engagements, weve formulated a 
six\-phase approach to investigative 
response and IR readiness: the 
Verizon Incident Preparedness and 
Response (VIPR) process. VIPR 
consists of six phases: (1\) Planning 
and Preparation, (2\) Detection and 
Validation, (3\) Containment and 
Eradication, (4\) Collection and Analysis, 
(5\) Remediation and Recovery, and (6\) 
Assessment and Adjustment.Further insight into these IR phases and 
their corresponding sub\-components

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is voluntary 
guidance based on existing standards, guidelines and 
practices to help organizations better manage and reduce 
cybersecurity risk. In addition to helping organizations 
manage and reduce risks, it was designed to foster risk and 
cybersecurity management communications among both 
internal and external organizational stakeholders.nist.govcyberframeworkrevRe c oIden

prioritize actions for reducing cybersecurity risk, and it is a tool 
for aligning policy, business and technological approaches to 
managing that risk. It can be used to manage cybersecurity risk 
across entire organizations or it can be focused on the delivery 
of critical services within an organization:nvlpubs.nist.govnistpubsCSWPNIST.CSWP.04162018\.pdfFive functions
The five functions of the NIST CSF are as follows:Identify. Develop an organizational understanding to 
manage cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data 
and capabilities.Examples of outcome categories include Asset Management, 
Business Environment, Governance, Risk Assessment and 
Risk Management Strategy.Protect. Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to 
ensure delivery of critical services.Examples of outcome categories include Identity Management

The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security 
Controls (CSCs) are internationally recognized cybersecurity 
best practices for defense against common threats. They are 
a consensus\-developed resource that brings together expert 
insight on cyber threats, business technology and security.Organizations with varying resources and risk exposure use 
the CIS CSCs to build an effective cyber\-defense program:cisecurity.orgcontrolscis\-controls\-listDBIR Implementation
The 2020 DBIR best describes the implementation of
CIS CSCs:For those who are unacquainted with the CIS CSCs, they 
are a community\-built, attacker\-informed prioritized set 
of cybersecurity guidelines that consist of 171 safeguards 
organized into 20 higher\-level controls.One of the unique elements of the CIS CSCs is their focus on 
helping organizations understand where to start their security 
program. This prioritization is represented in two ways:Through the ordering of the CSCs so that they allow a loose 
prioritization (CSC\-1: Inventory of Hardware is probably a 
better place to start than CSC\-20: Penetration Testing)Introduced in version 7\.150 is the concept of Implementation 
Groups, in which the 171 safeguards are grouped, based on 
the resources and risks the organizations are facing. This 
means that a smaller organization with fewer resources 
(Implementation Group 1\) shouldnt be expected to 
implement resource and process\-intensive controls such as 
Passive Asset Discovery even if its within CSC\-1, while an

Since 2014, confirmed data breaches with Espionage 
motive made up about 8% of the breaches reported in the 
Educational Services industry. In 2019, the percentage 
was only 1%. While the percentage is low, this percentage 
is somewhat driven down due to the very high rate of 
Ransomware (80%) financially motivated breaches that
target this industry.Another consideration when looking at the numbers for the 
Educational Industry is that Cyber\-Espionage threat actors 
are known to use ransomware to cover up data theft, and in 
many cases the threat actor succeeds in preventing analysts 
from determining what if any data was exfiltrated from the 
network. This is particularly true when the organization 
doesnt have sufficient logging in place to properly investigate.0%20%40%60%25%

The DBIR dataset pertaining to Cyber\-Espionage in the 
Financial and Insurance industry has seen some significant 
changes in percentages. For the past seven years 
(2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe), Financial on average was 
approximately 3%; however in the last three years, it made up 
6\.3% of Cyber\-Espionage breaches. In 2018, there was
a significant increase where it reached 10\.3%.Remember, these numbers represent only reported breaches. 
When the compromised data doesnt fall within reporting 
criteria, a private organization may choose not to disclose 
a breach. This makes Cyber\-Espionage breaches, which 
are already challenging to detect, even less likely to be 
discovered and by extension, reported. There is no way to 
truly gauge the magnitude of Cyber\-Espionage attacks, 
especially in any of the private industries.0%10%20%30%40%50%60%Web Applications58%Payment Card Skimmers12%Miscellaneous ErrorsPrivilege MisuseEverything Else8%8%7%Crimeware5%Cyber\-EspionageLost and Stolen AssetsPoint of SaleDenial of Service2%1%0%0%Figure \#70: Breaches by pattern for Financial

The Information industry reported the fourth\-highest amount 
of Cyber\-Espionage\-motivated data breaches during the 
2014\-2020 DBIR timeframe. Information is a vast industry, 
which encompasses all organizations involved in the creation, 
storage or transmission of information.The bread\-and\-butter motivation for Information industry 
data breaches is Financial; however, we have still seen 7% of 
breaches with a Cyber\-Espionage motive.An important factor for breaches in the Information industry 
is that since 2019, there has been a significant increase in 
web applications attacks, which are leveraging both stolen 
credentials and vulnerability exploitation. Misconfiguration 
errors were a main contributing factor to breaches in the 
Information industry.0%10%20%30%40%50%60%Web Applications42%Miscellaneous Errors26%Everything Else15%Cyber\-EspionagePrivilege Misuse7%6%Crimeware4%Lost and Stolen Assets1%Point of SaleDenial of ServicePayment Card Skimmers0%0%0%Figure \#80: Breaches by pattern for Information

(2014\-2020 DBIR; n\=985\)Summary
In 2019, the Manufacturing industry had the largest number 
of Cyber\-Espionage\-motivated breaches compared to other 
industries. Overall between 2014 and 2020, its ranked as 
the second\-highest\-hit industry at nearly 22% of all reported 
Cyber\-Espionage breaches.In 2018, we noted a significant drop in reported Cyber\-
Espionage breaches in the Manufacturing industry. However, 
we believe this was due in part to a change that year in DBIR 
contributors who typically provide specific metrics around 
Cyber\-Espionage breaches in Manufacturing.Cyber\-Espionage threat actors primarily target Secrets and
like all other industriesCredentials as a means to acquire 
these Secrets.50040030020010002014201520162017201820192020Cyber\-Espionage breachesAll breachesFigure \#91: Cyber\-Espionage breaches within all breaches annually

motives, resulting in significant ranges for Financial and 
Espionage motive percentages.For this industry combination, we observed a range of 
8%\-43% in Espionage motives, making the degree of this 
threat uncertain. The range also highlights the challenges in 
identifying Espionage\-motivated attacks and determining just 
how prevalent the threat is in this industry.We see the dominant action for Cyber\-Espionage breaches
in this industry as Social followed closely by Malware

The Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services industry 
has seen approximately 11% of the Cyber\-Espionage 
breaches between 2014 and 2019\. Like other private 
industries, not all Cyber\-Espionage breaches are reported.Since 2015, we have seen a definite decline in reported 
Espionage\-motivated attacks in the Professional industry.
We cannot account for the number of unreported breaches.From the reported breaches, however, we can see that 
assets Person and User Dev were the top compromised 
assets and that 80% of compromised data was classified
as Secrets.50040030020010002014201520162017201820192020Cyber\-Espionage breachesAll breachesFigure \#110: Cyber\-Espionage breaches within all breaches

(2014\-2020 DBIR; n\=2,152\)Summary
The Public Administration industry has ranked in the past 
several years as one of the top industries reporting confirmed 
data breaches with a Cyber\-Espionage motive. In fact, in the 
past three years, nearly half of Cyber\-Espionage breaches 
were reported in the public sector. And, since 2014, nearly a 
quarter of the Cyber\-Espionage breaches were reported in 
this industry.There are a few factors to consider when looking at these 
numbers. We know that government data is one of the top 
data types of interest to Nation\-state and State\-affiliated 
actors, so these numbers dont surprise us. However, it is 
important to point out that the public industry has more 
stringent reporting requirements than the private sector, 
which will inevitably result in more breaches being reported.50040030020010002014201520162017201820192020Cyber\-Espionage breachesAll breachesFigure \#120: Cyber\-Espionage breaches within all breaches

The Cyber\-Espionage Report (CER) Team is a subset of 
VTRAC combined with elements of the DBIR Team. Weve 
spent years investigating advanced threat actor data breaches, 
assessing cybersecurity postures and advising on IR measures 
in our current roles and previous lives.Managing DirectorContributorsChris NovakAuthorsDavid Kennedy, Alex Pinto,

The Verizon Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC) 
has been assisting customers globally with maturing and 
improving their IR readiness for more than 14 years. In 
conducting its engagements, VTRAC uses industry best 
practicessuch as the NIST Cybersecurity Frameworkand 
our VIPR phases, as well as our expertise from the more than 
500 incidents we investigate globally each year. We cover all 
five functional areas of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.Our capabilities include endpoint forensics, network forensics, 
malware reverse engineering, threat intelligence, threat hunting, 
dark web research, mobile device forensics and complex data 
recovery, as well as breach simulations, cyber threat landscape 
briefings, IR capability assessments, first responder training, 
and IR Plan and playbook development.VTRAC has written the bookliterallyon data breaches, 
from starting the DBIR phenomenon and contributing annually 
to the Payment Security Report to creating the Data Breach 
Digests, Insider Threat Report, Incident Preparedness and 
Response Report and now the CER.With the CER now under our proverbial belts, the only 
question left unanswered is:What will VTRAC set its sights on next? Stay tuned to find

Cyber\-Espionage breaches occur when external attackers, 
such as State\-affiliated or Nation\-state threat actors, 
penetrate victim organization cyberdefenses to steal sensitive 
data or proprietary information. The cover image for our first\-
ever Cyber\-Espionage Report depicts a Cyber\-Espionage 
breach at the moment the attacker pierces the veil of security 
en route to plundering their targeted victims critical assets 
and most sensitive information.58Verizon thought leadershipData Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)Data BreachesCybersecurity Incidents9 x Incident Classification Patterns \|9 x CIS CSCsenterprise.verizon.comresourcesreportsdbirMobile Security Index (MSI)Mobile DevicesIoTWi\-Fi Security Insight5 x Fortify Levelsenterprise.verizon.comresourcesreportsmobile\-security\-indexInsider Threat Report (ITR)Insider Threat BreachesCybersecurityIncidents5 x Breach Scenarios \|
