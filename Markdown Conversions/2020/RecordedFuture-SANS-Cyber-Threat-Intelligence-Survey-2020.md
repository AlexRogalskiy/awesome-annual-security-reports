Executive Summary
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is analyzed information about the capabilities, 
opportunities and intent of adversaries that meets a specific requirement determined 
by a stakeholder. Organizations with CTI 
programs focus on understanding the threats 
they face and providing specific information 
to help defend against those threats. In 
the past few years, CTI has evolved from 
small, ad\-hoc tasks performed disparately 
across an organization to, in many cases, 
robust programs with their own staff, tools 
and processes that support the entire 
organization. 2020 was a big year for the 
SANS CTI Survey, with a record number of 
respondents and the highest ever reporting of 
CTI programs within organizations, with 1,006 
responding to the survey in 2020 and just 505 
responding in 2019\.
1 Some areas leveled out 
after years of growthsuch as implementation 
of threat intelligence platforms and a focus 
on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) 
over just indicators of compromise (IoCs)and 
some areas continued to grow both in number 
and variety, such as the types of data being 
used to generate intelligence. As the field 
settles into its new maturity, understanding 
and improving the effectiveness of CTI 
programs will become even more critical. 
With that in mind, SANS asked respondents 
to weigh in on how their programs measure 
effectiveness, an area that CTI programs must 
continue to improve on in the coming years.

TAKEAWAYS

Collaboration is key. While the number of organizations with dedicated 
threat intelligence teams is growing, we continue to see an emphasis 
on partnering with others, whether through a paid service provider 
relationship or through information\-sharing groups or programs. In addition, 
collaboration within organizations is also on the rise, with many respondents 
reporting that their CTI teams are part of a coordinated effort across the 
organization. 

Not all processes require the same level of automation. Semi\-automation 
may be the gold standard when it comes to data processing, even for some 
tasks that are often considered redundant, such as data deduplication, 
because such information is sometimes useful to analysts.

The necessary data and tools change as CTI teams evolve. As more 
organizations begin to produce their own intelligence, the nature of 
information that CTI analysts require is also shifting from primarily threat\-
feed or vendor\-provided information to data from internal tools and teams. 
While many of the same tools and processes can be used to handle this type 
of information, organizations also must determine how this changes their 
need for tools handling this data. 

Requirements are taking hold and are a staple of mature teams. 
Requirements are a key part of the intelligence process and help to ensure 
a focus on collection and analysis efforts by analysts as well as proper 
production of intelligence. This makes the intelligence process more 
efficient, effective and measurablekeys to long\-term success. Last year, 
a minority of organizations reported that they had clearly defined and 
documented intelligence requirements, which was highlighted as a key 
recommendation for organizations. This year, nearly half of respondents 
answered that they have defined and documented intelligence requirements. 
This is a fantastic jump in the data and is an encouragement to anyone who 
is seeking to add defined and documented intelligence requirements into 
their CTI program.

A community of consumers and producers contribute to CTI. More 
organizations consume intelligence than produce it (as we would expect), 
but more than 40% of respondents both produce and consume intelligence. 
This is a great indicator of the growing maturity and professionalization 
of the cyber threat intelligence field. Organizations that have trouble 
satisfying a majority of their intelligence requirementsbecause they are 
only consuming intelligence or are missing any of their priority intelligence 
requirementsshould consider moving to both generating and consuming 
intelligence. Those considering generating cyber threat intelligence should 
review the SANS CTI Summit videos2 on the topic andor attend a CTI course.3

This years survey response pool represented a wide\-ranging group of security 
professionals from various organizations. Figure 1 provides a snapshot of those 
respondents.CTI Programs: The Right People and the Right Tools
Cyber Threat Intelligence involves analyzing information about threats and producing 
guidance to determine what steps must be taken in response to those threats. This 
process, which by now seems intuitive in concept, is incredibly complex and relies on a 
combination of people, processes and tools to both generate, consume and act on the 
intelligence. All three things are critical to a successful CTI program. Without personnel 
to evaluate information and make analytic judgements, there would be no CTI. Likewise, 
without processes and tools, even the best analysts will find themselves severely limited 
in the amount of data they can turn into actionable intelligence compared with the 
volume of threats their organizations potentially face. While the 2020 CTI Survey results 
show some promising improvements in these critical areas, they also highlight places 
where the community would benefit from continued efforts.

Figure 1\. Key Demographic 
Information
People
People are often considered the core of a CTI program. Not only do they conduct the 
analysis that will lead to finished intelligence, but they also decide what tools and 
processes to use to support their efforts. A single analyst can be successful with 
the right tools and support from other security teams; however, respondents have 
historically reported the difficulty that these lone individuals face when trying to keep 
up with the sheer volume of tasks. In the past three years, we have seen an increase 
in the percentage of respondents choosing to have a dedicated team over a single 
individual responsible for the entire 
CTI program. According to the 2020 
CTI Survey results, almost half of all 
respondents report that they have a 
dedicated team, which is especially 
encouraging because it means those 
single analysts now have help! See 
Figure 2\.
Another way to address the need 
for skilled analysts is to work with 
external partners to handle or 
support an organizations CTI functionality. In the past year, more organizations have 
chosen to partner with external resources, with 61% of respondents reporting that CTI 
tasks are handled by a combination of in\-house and service provider teams, up from 
54% in 2019\.4 The number of teams relying solely on service providers has remained 
relatively consistent, with 8% in 2019 and 7% in 2020\. 
Some respondents provided additional insight into the collaboration supporting their 
organizations CTI programs, for example the handling of network defense in\-house, 
indicating that other CTI tasks such as data collection and providing threat assessments 
might be handled by external partners. One respondent reported that while their 
primary role is a threat intelligence service provider who supported other organizations, 
they still have relationships with external partners of their 
own. In some situations, an organization is limited in the 
amount of information it can share with external partners, 
such as with some government\-sector respondents, but 
even in those cases, relationships with external partners 
can still be beneficial by providing insight into what other 
organizations are seeing or trends that may become 
significant down the road. 
Now that we see the highest reported number of 
dedicated threat intelligence teams in respondent 
organizations, it is helpful to understand how these teams 
are structured. In the 2020 survey, respondents reported 
a mix of security operations center (SOC) and incident 
response (IR) personnel, as illustrated in Figure 3\.

These skills are all extremely useful to an organizations threat intelligence capabilities, 
as both incident triage and in\-depth IR of internal events are critical to understanding 
the threats that an organization faces. In the past, we have seen similar numbers of 
SOC and IR resources as part of CTI teams; however this years respondents reported 
having a higher number of dedicated threat intelligence analysts as part of their teams. 
Respondents also indicated a high level of cross\-functional collaboration between 
security teams in their organizations, writing that their CTI team is part of a purple 
team or a fusion cell focusing on security. In addition, some of the responses make it 
clear that there is not, and will likely never be, a one\-size\-fits\-all 
approach to CTI teams, adding their own categories of personnel 
including finance, digital crimes and security strategy teams. 
This years survey responses are very promising for the 
continued evolution of CTI as a critical security function. 
Not only were there more people responding to the survey 
in general, but respondents are reporting more personnel 
dedicated to CTI functions while maintaining and even improving collaboration 
with both internal and external teams. With more people and more teams working 
collaboratively, it is even more important to have the right processes and tools in place 
to support CTI efforts. 
CTI Tools
Threat intelligence is the result of the aggregation and analysis of data related to the 
intent, opportunity and capabilities of adversaries. Getting the right data to the right 
places for analysis is crucial to the process. While there will always be some level of 
human analysis in the overall intelligence process, the goal is to allow CTI analysts to 
spend their time on the things requiring their expert judgment, and take the manual 
work out of the processes that dont. This year, we saw a small decrease in the number 
of respondents reporting manual efforts in some key areas, but there was still a fair 
amount of sad\-face emojis in the comments when asked about manual processes. 
For the survey, we have broken CTI tools into two functional groupings: tools for 
processing data and turning it into intelligence, and tools for managing intelligence 
including generating alerts based on intelligence. 
Processing Tools 
Data must be processed before it can be analyzed and turned into intelligence. 
Processing includes repeatable tasks such as deduplication of data, data enrichment 
and data standardization, along with other more intensive tasks requiring analysis 
of their own, such as reverse engineering of malware. Most organizations report that 
processing is either a manual or semi\-automated process. Deduplication is the most 
commonly automated process, with only 27% of organizations reporting manual 
deduplication of data. Reverse engineering of samples is the least automated process, 
with 48% reporting manual efforts for this task, up slightly from last year. This trend is 
evident with regard to management tools, where forensics platforms have the second 
lowest level of automation and the highest level of disparate use, meaning that when 
they are used in a CTI function analysts must manually initiate the transfer of data or 
manually input data from one system to another. 
2020 SANS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Survey
With more people and more teams working 
collaboratively, it is even more important to 
have the right processes and tools in place 
to support CTI efforts. 
Respondents did not report a high level of change in processing capabilities 
between 2019 and 2020\. The majority of processing tasks are done either manually 
or are semi\-automated. One area where we saw automation improvement in is the 
enrichment of data. Manual enrichment of information using internal data sources 
is down by 5% balanced by a slight increase in semi\-automated and fully automated 
processes. Enrichment of information using external public data sources and using 
semi\-automated methods increased by 5% from 2019\. Interestingly, reporting of fully 
automated processing remained the same or decreased slightly with the exception of 
enrichment of internal data, suggesting an interesting concept in an industry where 
complete automation is often the end goal. Because data processing is such a critical 
step in the analytic process, it appears that analysts are reluctant to trust this step 
entirely to automated processes, staying true to somewhat ironic phrase trust but 
verify. Streamlining the verification process might result in more semi\-automated 
processes versus fully automated processes, but may be just what analysts need to 
support their work. 
Management Tools
In the 2020 CTI Survey, respondents report that Security Information and Event 
Management (SIEM) platforms, network traffic monitoring tools and intrusion monitoring 
platforms are the most heavily used tools. Of this, SIEM platforms have the highest 
reported level of use (86\.9%) as well as the highest use of automation. Most other 
management tools, including network traffic monitoring, intrusion analysis and 
forensics platforms are reported as having some automation, with the exception of 
spreadsheets and emails, which are mostly processed manually. Despite the lack of 
automated or semi\-automated processes, spreadsheets and emails remain one of the 
top management tools for CTI analysts. See Figure 4\.

Over the years, respondents have consistently listed spreadsheets as a CTI tool for both 
management and processing. In addition to allowing data to be stored and shared, 
many spreadsheet applications have built\-in functionality that supports processing 
such as sorting, deduplication and converting 
the data into various visual formats. Many 
dedicated CTI tool developers understand 
that spreadsheets are familiar and functional 
for analysts and have built them into their 
own processes. Most data in CTI tools can 
be exported and imported into .csv format, 
and some SIEM tools allow users to build 
automated tasks around data in spreadsheets. 
These additions will help overcome some 
of the shortcomings of working with 
spreadsheets, such as getting consistent 
data to different users within the same team, 
which is even more important now that there 
are more dedicated CTI teams as opposed to 
standalone analysts.
CTI Processes: The Intelligence Cycle
The CTI community and many organizations both produce and consume intelligence. 
Over the years, more and more organizations report that they are producing and 
consuming data, with a 10% increase from 2019 in those that both produce and consume 
raw threat data and a nearly 7% increase in those who both produce and consume 
alerts with contextual data as well as published threat reports. Of the three categories 
of CTI, we see only published threat intelligence with 
more sole consumers, with 55% consuming this type 
of intelligence without producing it (see Figure 5\). 
Regardless of whether an organization produces 
andor consumes intelligence, a process is required 
to move from identification of what questions must 
be answered using threat intelligence to actions 
benefitting an organizations defenses. For many 
organizations, that process is a version of the classic 
intelligence cycle. 
The intelligence cycle is a process for generating 
accurate, useable intelligence. It begins with 
a planning phase, in which the intelligence 
questions that must be answered (also known 
as requirements) are generated. When the


More organizations are investing in dedicated CTI teams versus individual 
analysts or fully outsourced functionalities. These teams will enable 
organizations to better understand and address the threats they face. Many 
organizations just beginning to build out their teams still need to focus not 
only on training of CTI skills, but also on collaboration and teamwork skills to 
work with internal and external partners, which are critical for a CTI team. 

We see less full automation and more semi\-automation in CTI processing 
tools. While we see more automation in the management of CTI, especially 
when it comes to the use of tools such as SIEMs and network management 
tools, respondents report less full automation and more semi\-automation 
in CTI processing tools. While manual processes are often a hindrance to 
analysis, semi\-automation may be the most beneficial for analysts, taking 
away some of the most tedious aspects of a task, but still providing analysts 
with a level of control and transparency that gives them confidence in their 
processes.

requirements are known, the next phase is collection, 
gathering data to help answer the questions and meet 
the requirements. The next phase is processing, where 
the data is put into a usable format for analysis. This 
leads into the fourth phase, analysis, in which the data 
is synthesized to identify the answers to the intelligence 
requirements. The last phase is dissemination, where 
the findings are captured in the right format to reach 
the intended audience outlined in the planning phase. 
It is important to note that while the intelligence 
cycle is a cyclical process, it is sometimes necessary 
to go backward in the process; for example if, during 
the analysis phase it is determined that additional 
information is needed or information must be 
processed in a different format, it is important to go 
back to the appropriate earlier step so that the end 
result is an informed, accurate analytic finding. See 
Figure 6\.
This years survey shows that more organizations are 
following the steps of the intelligence cycle either intentionally or intuitively. In the 2020 
survey, we covered three critical processes from the intelligence cycle: requirements, 
collection and dissemination.
Requirements 
The 2019 CTI Survey 
was the first year 
that we looked into 
the development and 
use of requirements 
to drive threat intelligence programs, an area that has seen incredible growth in the 
past year. Requirements seek to identify what specific questions or concerns must be 
addressed by a threat intelligence program. The number 
of organizations reporting a formal process for gathering 
requirements increased 13% from last year to almost 44% 
(see Table 1\). 
Also positive news: Those contributing to CTI requirements 
increased across the board, with respondents reporting 
more input from teams including security operations, 
IR and business units. In fact, security operations had 
more input than the CTI teams this year, indicating that 
operations are beginning to drive intelligence for the first 
time reported. See Figure 7\.

Figure 7\. CTI Requirements Contributors
Respondents report that requirements are primarily updated in an ad hoc manner 
rather than on a scheduled (yearly, monthly or weekly) basis. But the good news is that 
only 5% of respondents say they dont update requirements at 
all (see Figure 8\). While there are some consistent themes in 
requirements across the board, many are unique to a specific 
organization or are based on past incidents or upcoming 
significant events for the organization. 
Examples of requirements from respondents include:

The activity of a specific adversary \[with whom] we had 
security incidents in the past, CTI team is tasked to monitor 
for new reported activity as well as profile the observed 
TTPs of this adversary

Consistently analyze and prioritize counter Business email 
compromise activity to protect our agent population from targeted attacks

Brand surveillance, supply chain and partner assessments
While there was a huge jump in organizations reporting development of requirements, 
over half of respondents still do 
not have a process for identifying 
requirements, which will help 
organizations be successful 
whether they produce or 
consume intelligence. Not having 
requirements or not having 
a process for evaluating and 
prioritizing new requirements can 
become a serious roadblock for 
many teams. 
Collection
After identifying requirements, the 
next step is to identify how to get 
access to the information that will 
help answer the requirements. 
For respondents who consume 
intelligence, this means evaluating 
sources of intelligence that will be 
easy to operationalize. Nearly 70% 
of respondents gather some of their 
information from a commercial 
threat feed, from both CTI\-specific 
and general security vendors, with 
over 45% consuming non\-feed 
information from a CTI service 
provider (see Figure 9\). When it

comes to consuming intelligence, timeliness and relevance are once again at the top of 
the list of important factors, but more and more respondents are considering how that 
information will be consumed as well as the content. This year, several respondents 
identified standardization with the Mitres ATT\&CK Matrix framework as a priority for 
information they consume. 
Producing intelligence involves the addition of other sources of data, most of which 
havent yet been processed or analyzed. These data sources include network traffic 
logs, vulnerability data, user behavior data and security data gathered from IDS, SIEMs 
and other internal security systems. A hybrid form of data also exists, for example 
information about a previous incident that has already been processed and analyzed in 
an IR context and will now be used to answer CTI requirements. 
Most respondents collect 
data from a variety of 
sources. This year we saw 
a significant increase 
in several types of 
intelligence collection 
from last year, including 
threat feeds from CTI\-
specific vendors, open\-
source threat feeds 
and forensics data (see 
Table 2\). This increase in 
information gathering 
corresponds to the 
increase in the number 
of respondents who both 
consume and produce 
intelligence. 
One interesting trend 
in the information 
from respondents is 
an increased interest 
in open source threat intelligence in regard to both data and tools. There was an 8% 
increase in respondents reporting the use of open source threat feeds as a collection 
source and a 14% increase in the use of open source threat intelligence management 
tools such as Collaborative Research Into Threats (CRITs) and Malware Information 
Sharing Platform (MISP). One respondent wrote that their organization is using MISP 
more heavily now that there is an increased emphasis on attacker TTPs rather than 
just IoC aggregation. Although we did not ask specifically about Mitres ATT\&CK Matrix 
framework in the 2020 survey, several respondents wrote in that their organizations have 
had success, particularly in adding contextual information to alerts and in prioritizing 
responses, by leveraging it.

Table 2\. Sources for Gathering Intelligence
2020
2019
Trend
Information gathering goes hand in hand with requirements in that requirements 
dictate what information the organization needs to collect. Although there are far 
fewer examples this year of organizations gathering information they dont need, some 
respondents still report their organizations spend money on data that they do not need 
or are unable to utilize. Just as with requirements, information should also periodically 
be evaluated to ensure that it is effective and usable. A data source that may have been 
critical in the past might no longer be needed, and new data sources might need to be 
identified as the organization and the threat landscape change. 
Dissemination 
In order for intelligence to be effective, 
it must get to the right audience in a 
way they are able to use it. The process 
of getting intelligence to its intended 
audience is called dissemination. CTI is 
primarily disseminated in the form of 
reports or briefings that summarize a 
particular threat or is disseminated to 
tools used to generate alerts or inform 
other security teams in an automated 
fashion. The majority of respondents use methods meant to disseminate intelligence 
to people, such as email, spreadsheets or PowerPoint presentations. For many, this 
is done on a regular basis such as weekly threat reports, daily email\-based briefs to 
other security teams or newsletters for general employee awareness. Briefings are 
also high on the list of ways to disseminate CTI, with respondents reporting regularly 
scheduled briefings as well as briefings for urgent issues, such as identifying when their 
organization has been targeted. See Figure 10\.
When it comes to intelligence meant to be understood by others in the organization, 
a high degree of personalization based on the audiences preferences is needed. As 
one respondent put it, Intelligence needs to be 
dissected before reaching different business units 
so it can be actionable. Finance will need a slightly 
different version of a brief that focuses on their 
specific business concerns than will the team 
responsible for brand protection, for example. 
Intelligence is also disseminated to tools used 
for alerting. Most organizations rely on a threat 
intelligence platform for this purpose. Respondents 
report a similar number of organizations using 
open source, vendor\-created or homegrown threat 
intelligence platforms to disseminate intelligence 
to other security systems. While the percentage 
of respondents using vendor platforms has been 
consistent in the past two years, the use of open 
source and homegrown systems has increased.

TAKEAWAYS

The development of CTI requirements is the first phase of the 
intelligence cycle and will help an organization ensure that the 
work being done meets the needs of their security program. More 
organizations are developing requirements, but the organizations that 
have not yet formalized this process can start by identifying the teams 
who leverage CTI and asking what questions they have or what problems 
they are consistently running into that CTI could help address. 

Although CTI data can come from a variety of sources, leveraging 
a framework such as Mitres ATT\&CK Matrix framework during 
the processing phase can help analysts identify trends and make 
connections between the different sources. 

Even the best\-analyzed CTI products become ineffective if they dont 
reach the right audience in a timely manner. With more organizations 
producing their own intelligence, it is critical to make sure the 
audienceand the way they best consume intelligenceis taken into 
consideration before dissemination. 
Value and Inhibitors of CTI
Respondents noted they are using CTI across the spectrum of detection, response, 
prevention and mitigation. 
CTI Uses and Use Cases
At a high level, the leading use was for threat detection 
(89%), followed by threat prevention (77%), threat response 
(72%) and threat mitigation (59%). Organizations focusing too 
heavily on threat prevention often struggle with detection 
and response, which would otherwise be core to their ability 
to maintain great prevention over time. Its clear from this 
years survey data that many organizations, at least where 
CTI is involved, have seen detection as the primary value 
driver. See Figure 11\.
The detection and response use cases deemed most valuable in weighted analysis 
order were IoCs, threat behaviors and adversary TTPs, digital footprint or attack 
surface identification, and strategic analysis of the adversary, respectively. Figure 12 
illustrates the raw rankings of each in terms value to organizations. While IoCs still 
seem to reign as a major value add to programs, there has been a growing focus on 
TTPs in organizations. As organizations have the proper tooling to leverage TTPs more 
effectively, they will likely edge out IoCs as a primary detection mechanism.
Combining TTPs and IoCs can form a powerful 
detection and response strategy. Instead of 
running IoCs over every piece of data and thus 
increasing false positives, consider leveraging 
TTPs as a primary detection strategy and 
then running the associated IoCs against the 
subset of detections based off of TTPs. As 
an example, running indicators associated 
with VPNs against all network traffic would 
yield a higher level of false positives than 
running those same indicators against only 
network traffic that alerted against TTP\-based 
detections associated with malicious use of 
VPNs. This allows analysts to have a more 
transposable and durable detection strategy with TTPs, but still gain the value and 
context associated with IoCs. Additionally, IoCs remain a highly effective mechanism 
for scoping environments once a threat is detected. Here, teams will excel at response 
when they prioritize their own IoCs observed in the detection stage.

Measuring Effectiveness and the Value of CTI
One obviously difficult area for organizations every year is measuring the effectiveness 
of cyber threat intelligence. The message is clear: 82% of respondents organizations 
find value in it, with 17% not being sure of how to answer and fewer than 1% of 
respondents noting that CTI did not improve their security and response efforts. 
But measuring exactly what value it is bringing in a structured and defined way is 
understandably difficult. Only 4% of respondents had processes in 
place to measure effectiveness (see Figure 13\). There is no one\-
size\-fits\-all strategy to measuring intelligence, but it must start with 
the intelligence requirements phase. Organizations with clearly 
defined intelligence requirements can use those requirements to 
set obtainable goals based on the intent behind the requirement. 
When looking at security and response use cases, these 
measurements can be mapped to overall defender\-based metrics 
instead of simply tracking adversary metrics.
Adversary metrics are those metrics that the adversary controls. 
As an example, if you were to track the number of intrusions you 
see per year, that metric would be influenced by two things: how 
often an adversary targets your network and how often you detect 
the intrusion. Of those two, the defender can only control how 
often they detect the intrusion. The adversary alone determines how often and how 
aggressively they target any given organization. Reporting only on adversary metrics 
can tell a misleading story that is difficult for CTI teams to understand. Instead, 
consider what story you can tell with defender\-based metrics. For example, against 
the known threats that you track and your coverage against the TTPs theyve shown. 
Historically, are you increasing the analytical breadth (coverage) and analytical depth 
(multiple detections for a single TTP) of your detections against the threats? How 
many IR playbooks has the CTI team contributed to based on their insights? How 
long did it previously take to scope your organization and with what level of visibility 
versus what you can to today based on investments in people, process and technology 
across the organization? These are all defender\-based metrics, because you can 
directly influence them and use them to tell your story more than the adversarys. 
Measurements are not only done in metrics, but the right metrics can tell a powerful 
story or identify issues to correct. 
Inhibitors Holding Programs Back
There are many reasons CTI teams can struggle, including those beyond their control 
such as management support or company resources. Sometimes it can also just be 
difficult to get started. When asked about the biggest inhibitors, it was clear the focus 
was on people and processes. The leading issue at 57% was the lack of trained staff and 
skills associated with fully utilizing CTI. The next leading issue at 52% was the time to 
implement proper intelligence processes across the team. Interestingly, the lowest issue,

selected by 23%, was confidence in using the information to make decisions (see Figure 
14\). CTI practitioners and the teams using threat intelligence seem to clearly understand 
how to use it to support them and understand its value but are stretched thin on finding 
the appropriate talent. It was good 
to see that only a minority suffered 
from lack of management buy\-in as 
well, which appears to note that the 
value propositions of CTI are well 
understood in most organizations at 
a variety of levels.
Participants were asked about their 
level of satisfaction with various 
aspects of CTI. The highest level of 
satisfaction for respondents was 
their ability to have visibility into 
threats (75%), search and report on 
those threats (73%) and have relevant 
threat data and information (72%). 
Automation and integration of CTI information through respondents tooling still scored 
well (61%), but the lowest rated area was machine learning with 36% satisfaction and 
58% outright dissatisfaction in the effectiveness or value of it. Tools can add a lot of 
value for intelligence analysis, but the process is heavily dependent on analysts.
Sharing Is Caring
Randomly sharing IoCs by plugging in threat feeds can lead to 
more harm than good. The CTI community has become more 
regimented about how it uses intelligence, and while IoCs are still 
of great value, most organizations have become more thoughtful 
in how they source this data. This much is clear: Sharing and 
networking are still core components of success for the community. 
Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) are not available 
to all respondents, although there was great global distribution in 
the home country of participants in the survey. And yet 45% still 
answered that they are members of an ISAC (see Figure 15\). The 
biggest inhibitors based on comments was the cost of some of the 
ISACs membership dues.

Respondents belonging to an ISAC 
noted value across a couple of key 
areas: 73% noted they did get some 
timely and relevant threat information 
from ISACs. Based on the data and 
comments, it was clear that a major 
value in the ISACs was gaining points of 
contact at member organizations (68%), 
advocacy in the community (44%) and 
the membership meetups (43%). See 
Figure 16\. 
As organizations mature, it is a common complaint that ISACs for threat information 
become less valuable. However, this simply means the organizations are outgrowing the 
perceived effectiveness, which is an overall good thing. In those cases, points of contact 
at other organizations become invaluable for going beyond the immediate sharing of 
available information and analysis on emerging threats and trends.
Whereas ISACs received high marks, there was a bit less consensus on the role and 
value of government in CTI. See Figure 17\. 
Written comments called out 
some specific organizations 
positively, such as the 
UKs NCSC. Overall though, 
only 47% of organizations 
thought government provided 
something significant or unique 
in value over what they were 
getting elsewhere. In many 
cases, the role of government 
is less about providing insights 
that differ from those emerging 
from the private sector (which 
largely has the expertise to 
generate those insights), but instead around the amplification of which threats the 
government thinks matter the most. Similar to the value propositions of the ISACs for 
more mature organizations, as the industry matures, the government should likely seek 
to take a role of empowering ISACs and adding additional amplification and context 
around known public threats in a wider forum.

Conclusion: Keep Moving Forward
A lot of progress has been made in the past few years around requirements. 
Next steps in this area include identifying when and why to update intelligence 
requirementseven ad hoc adjustments can be planned for by identifying 
the circumstances under which they would need to be changed. It is also 
clear that there are numerous positive trends in the community, such as more 
organizations producing intelligence instead of just consuming it. But there are 
also many challenges, such as getting the appropriate staffing and training to 
conduct cyber threat intelligence. Tools and data sources are always going to be 
vital to the process, but the world of intelligence analysis is inherently analyst\-
driven and a focus is rightfully placed there. 
Sharing not only IoCs and adversary TTPs, but also processes and analytic 
processes, will help the community continue to mature. Some processes to 
share include strategies for measuring the effectiveness of a CTI program. These 
metrics should be based on requirements and should be defender\-based 
metricsfor example, how long did it previously take to scope your organization 
and with what level of visibility vs. what you can to today based on investments 
in people, process and technology across the organization? While the specific 
metrics will likely differ from organization to organization, the processes can be 
developed leveraging shared best practices and ideally can be built into tools 
in the future, both commercial and open\-source, making the process timely, 
effective and repeatable.

Takeaway
In the coming year, get more 
involved in the community and 
find the best practices from 
other organizations, especially 
around intelligence requirements 
and analyst development. With 
many changes in the world in 
the coming year, from political 
elections and global trade 
tensions, to natural disasters 
with unknown consequences, CTI 
analysts will likely be asked to 
focus on new and unanticipated 
threats. Being part of a community 
of intelligence analysts sharing 
threat data, best practices and 
lessons learned will help everyone 
adapt to rapidly changing 
situations and provide intelligence 
to protect critical networks.
