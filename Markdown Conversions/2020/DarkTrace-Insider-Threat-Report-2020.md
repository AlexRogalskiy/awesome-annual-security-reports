Insider ThreatInsider attacks are difficult to spot, yet they often have 
the greatest impact on business operations. Malicious 
or compromised insiders can be difficult to identify due 
to their privileged access and knowledge of company 
workings, enabling them to easily evade detection.Despitetheriskposedbymaliciousinsiders,firms 
struggle to monitor employees and respond to these 
threats. 72% of organizations reported an increase in 
insider attacks last year, according to Cybersecurity 
Insiders 2020 Insider Threat Report.Recentchangestoinfrastructureandworkforce 
habitshavecomplicatedthesituation.Thesame 
report notes that more than half of IT professionals 
say migration to the cloud has made it more difficult to 
identify insider threats. When it comes to monitoring 
critical users, only 61% of organizations have visibility 
over privileged accounts.Ontopofthis,personalmobiledeviceshave

this as highly anomalous behavior and alerted the security team to the incident.

a technician came in to perform scheduled maintenance on a smart door. As soon 
as their laptop had connected to the control unit, the IoT device was seen making 
highly unusual connections to rare external IP addresses.Darktrace then detected that the control unit was attempting to download trojans and 
other payloads, as well as mining cryptocurrency with a Monero (XMR) CPU miner. 
The device was using a SMB exploit to make external connections on port 445 while 
searching for vulnerable internal devices using the outdated SMBv1 protocol.Onehourlater,thedeviceconnectedtoanendpointrelatedtothethird\-party 
remoteaccesstoolTeamViewer.Afterafewminutes,thedevicewasseen 
uploading over 15 MB to a 100% rare external IP.The attack managed to bypass the rest of the organizations security stack because 
it was introduced directly from a trusted external laptop, and the IoT device itself 
was managed by the third\-party vendor, so the customer had little visibility over it.Darktraces Cyber AI Analyst reported on every stage of the attack, including the 
download of the first malicious executable file. The customer was also alerted via 
a Proactive Threat Notification following a high scoring model breach at 16:59, just 
seven minutes after the attack had commenced.Figure 8:The connections associated with the compromise are a significant 
deviation from the devices normal 'pattern of life' and results in multiple

and confirm that the laptop belonged to a member of the IT team who had been 
using an illegitimate scanning tool to look for vulnerabilities.35%of organizations are affected by

Most miners use surplus computer capacity at night when offices are closed, but 
others go to more extreme lengths to slip under the radar.Darktrace traced wires in the data center to 12 servers under the floorboards. It 
turned out that an employee was responsible for installing the servers: they had 
been slowly siphoning them off to set up an extensive bitcoin mining operation 
from within the company.Threat Landscape Series \| 10Figure 14: A sample of models breached by the
