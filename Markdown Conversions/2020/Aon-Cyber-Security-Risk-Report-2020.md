This years Report demonstrates the breadth and depth of our collective understanding of cyber riskacross Aon . In it, we focus on the unexpected ways that cyber risk impacts clients, in six less\-appreciatedareas: Intellectual Property, Mergers and Acquisitions, Retirement, Executives, Computer Crime and TheCorporation . Our experience allows us to see the entire puzzle and how the pieces fit together . As such,part of the Report provides a playbook for each highlighted risk to help organizations solve the ever\-more\-complex puzzle that is cyber risk .As outlined in our recent white paper, The Cyber Loop: Managing Cyber Risk Requires a Circular Strategy,there is nothing linear about cyber security . Solving the cyber puzzle requires a tactical mix of technology,people and process in the form of assessment, quantification, insurance and incident response readiness .Regardless of where your organization is in its digital journey, the Cyber Loop can help insulate your companyfrom a variety of cyber risks . And importantly, it acknowledges that cyber risk is an enterprise risk, not solelya technology concern . Companies have a duty to understand that corporate riskand the threat to businesscontinuity and customer datais at stake .Every business has a cyber story .

corporate riskis directly tied 
to balance sheet impact. 
Companies should consider an organizational assessmentand sensitive data mapping exercise to identify data thatrequires enhanced protection and governance, especiallygiven the current environment of evolving (and increasing)global privacy regulation . Quantifying the financial impactof a cyber event is essential not only for good corporategovernance, but also for strategic decision\-making .Abreach scenario impact analysis can bring needed visibilityto guide investment decisions for information security,business continuity programs and risk transfer strategies .Incident response readiness can help lessen the impactof a breach . An effective response can mitigate the potentialreputational impact and liability from regulatory fines andpenalties . This may be relevant in several ways, dependingon the type of breach . It may demonstrate to regulators andshareholders that the company was prepared and that thedirectors and officers did not breach their fiduciary dutyto the company . In the case of a credit card breach, it isimportant to have an independent forensic investigator towork with counsel to ensure that the PCI Forensic Investigator(PFI) reporting is accurate to minimize potential fines .Robust data protection and governance programsshould be established to include a holistic approach toidentify, assess, protect, monitor and manage sensitivedata throughout its lifecycle, regardless of where it isstored across the organizations operations . This willcommonly require the integration of privacy complianceand cyber security initiatives and will typically employvarious forms of technology, process and standardsas well as policies across the organization .Cyber breaches in recent years have led to investorscrutiny and event\-driven litigation is a significant exposurefor corporate leadership . Insurance can play a part inprotecting companies from the liability associated witha breach . However, the insurance purchase for breach\-related risk transfer is not one\-size\-fits\-all . Directors andOfficers liability insurance is vital to protect the corporationand the personal assets of the board against the costsof defending litigation and paying judgment awards orsettlements . Other lines of coverage may come into playas well, such as employment practices liability coverageto protect against BIPA\-related employment litigation .Cyber insurance is also an option for evolving privacy andsecurity risks to protect companies against the financialstatement impact of a breach, as well as provide pre\-lossprevention and post\-loss services, to help organizationsto recover more quickly from the impact of a breach .A breach scenario 
impact analysis can 
bring visibility to guide

against evolving 
cyber security 
risks and threats.PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHERPutting It All TogetherThis playbook is designed to help organizations be successful while operating 
in a digital environment that presents great opportunityand great risk . It 
pulls together thinking that considers less\-publicized cyber risks: intellectual 
property, mergers and acquisitions, retirement, executives, computer crime and 
the corporation, adding these pieces to the evolving cyber risk puzzle .Some of the plays to solve for cyber risk remain the same: stay 
informed, understand the organizations risk profile and be proactive 
in its defense. Others require more advanced action: Identify your organizations most critical data, dependent systems and business processes, 
and know where on the network they reside; Establish a sound incident response plan and put the plan into practice; Develop a regular cyber risk assessment program to track remediation progress andmeasure against evolving threats; Regularly test critical access points against cyber intrusion, especially new points of 
connectivity;Become deeply literate in risk transfer and understand what your portfolio of property and 
casualty insurance policies does or does not cover related to cyber security; Use financial modeling to quantify potential loss; Stay abreast of regulations and be aware that disclosing risk may be just as important as 
disclosing a breach; Realize the growing vulnerability of the executive team; Maintain a holistic cyber security program to include preventive, detective and 
reactive measures and controls, and mechanisms for continuous improvement .Taken together, the recommendations in this playbook have one chief goal: 
To help enhance the organizations position against 
evolving cyber security risks and threats.2020 Cyber Security Risk ReportCyber Solutions27
