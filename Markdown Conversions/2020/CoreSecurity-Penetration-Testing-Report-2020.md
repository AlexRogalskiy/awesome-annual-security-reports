Penetration testing is a vital method to evaluate the security of an organization. 
By attempting to exploit potential security weaknesses of all kinds, from 
misconfigurations to end user mistakes, organizations can proactively take action 
before an attack occurs. 
Having spent over two decades observing and participating in the evolution of 
penetration testing, Core Security, A HelpSystems Company, wanted to ascertain 
the role penetration testing plays across organizations of different sizes and 
industries. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the effectiveness 
of ethical hacking strategies, and the resources required to deploy a successful pen 
testing program. 
The results of this global survey, which will be explored in detail in this report, 
provide valuable data on the following key issues related to pen testing:
 
Why to pen test
 
Remediation efforts
 
Finding skilled personnel
 
Executive buy in
 
Choosing toolsets
 
How results are reported
 
Compliance concerns
This survey data establishes a strong baseline to track year over year changes, 
trends, and areas of improvement. With its inauguration, we have sought to create 
a valuable resource from which the community of cybersecurity professionals can 
benefit.
Introduction
2020 Pen Testing Report

www.coresecurity.com
One of the biggest concerns across organizations appears to 
be getting others to act on the findings (Figure 1\). However, 
97% of respondents noted that penetration testing was at least 
somewhat important to their security posture (Figure 2\).This implies that while pen testing programs are encouraged and 
supported, suggested remediations are not always implemented. 
This shows a mismatch between how important pen testing is 
seen and how much priority the results of a pen test are given. 
This may represent a lack of understanding of how security 
weaknesses correlate to business risks, such as the loss of 
revenue, or interruption of critical services.
Despite this, 39% of respondents reported being confident 
in their organizations security posture (Figure 3\), which is an 
indicator of overconfidence and a common issue in the in the 
cybersecurity world. How can you be confident in your security 
posture if you do not effectively test it?

Reasons for Pen Testing
Organizations appear to have an even balance for why they pen test, 
with 70% reporting that they perform pen tests for vulnerability 
management program support, 69% for measuring security posture, 
and 67% for compliance (Figure 4\).
Common Security Concerns
Respondents also reported misconfiguration (77%), phishing (72%), 
and poor passwords (60%) as top concerns (Figure 5\). This may 
indicate that pen testing is a desirable way to test for risks related 
to user error. These common entry points are typically best solved 
through a combination of retraining efforts and security tools.
Misconfiguration issues can be alleviated with routine training for 
the IT teams that are responsible for these systems. Additionally, 
automation tools can handle routine administration tasks to maintain 
consistent policies. Problems like phishing and poor passwords 
can occur throughout the organization, and will need consistent 
reeducation sessions, particularly for those who fail phishing 
simulations. Password tools can enforce strong password policies to 
reduce risk. Ultimately, maintaining your security posture over time 
requires regular penetration testing and retesting to see if these 
efforts are effective.

Compliance and Pen Testing
Figure 6:Importance of penetration testing for compliance 
The need to stay compliant or adhere to external mandates was a 
primary reason respondents pen testing (68%), as seen in Figure 4\. 
95% of respondents reported that pen testing held some level of 
importance for their compliance initiatives.
Much of the most important data (Figure 7\) for respondents to 
protectcustomer, patient, financial, or employeefall under 
some sort of regulation or industry best practice. NIST, SOX, NERC, 
HIPAA, CMMC, and GDPR will most likely be followed by additional 
mandates that emphasize the importance of protecting sensitive 
data, ensuring that pen testing will continue to be a critical tool for 
organizations needing to demonstrate the effectiveness of their 
security programs.

Phishing
Phishing attempts are nearly impossible to block from every inbox 
and are an incredibly common way for attackers to gain access 
to employee credentials and an organizations systems. 72% of 
respondents noted that phishing was a top security concern, 
indicating that organizations are very aware of the risk that this 
attack strategy poses (Figure 5\).
Phishing simulations can be run to see what type of ploys are tricking 
employees, and who is susceptible to them. These social engineering 
pen tests are a valuable tool for education and awareness, which are 
the primary prevention methods for this type of attack. However, 
19% responded that they never conduct phishing simulations, 
and 25% only conduct them annually, which may indicate a lack of 
awareness of how helpful frequent phishing simulations are, or a lack 
of resources (Figure 8\).

Penetration Testing Frequency
Figure 9:Frequency of penetration testing
It is promising to see that only a small percentage of respondents 
(15%) indicated that they never pen test. This indicates that pen 
testing is viewed as a critical practice that makes an impact in an 
organizations security posture. Ideally, as long as it done by the right 
people and with the right tools, pen tests should be run as frequently 
as possible, particularly when significant changes or updates are 
made to the infrastructure (Figure 9\). 
The largest percentage of respondents (32%) test one to two times 
a year. While this may help sort priorities about security weaknesses, 
it does indicate a lack of re\-testing, which is an important way to 
validate remediation efforts. Those with internal pen testing teams 
did report testing more frequently, with 47% reporting monthly or 
quarterly testing, versus 33% of everyone surveyed. This indicates 
that testing frequency is most likely heavily influenced by budget 
and resources.
20% of respondents reported pen testing daily or weekly. Pen 
testing is typically quite a large undertaking, so there may be a 
misunderstanding about the difference between a vulnerability scan, 
which can be run daily or weekly, and a full pen test.

In\-House Penetration Testing Efforts
Figure 10:In\-house penetration testing
While some businesses exclusively enlist the services of a third\-party 
penetration testing team, it is now quite common to build an in\-house 
team, with 42% of respondents working at organizations that have one 
in place (Figure 10\). 
Teams remain relatively small, with 84% of respondents reporting teams 
of five dedicated team members or fewer (Figure 11\). It is also possible 
that these teams are assisted by personnel that have pen testing tasks 
as part of their duties, but arent considered full time team members. 
Additionally, other organizations may still perform pen testing activities, 
but dont have teams solely for this purpose.
Once in place, these teams seem to prove themselves valuable. Only 7% 
responded that their in\-house team is now defunct, perhaps showing 
that once in place, organizations prefer to keep them intact. In fact, 46% 
of respondents that have in\-house teams noted that they were confident 
in their security posture versus the only 29% of those that did not have 
an internal team (Figure 12\). 
It is also worth noting that 61% of those that reported they did not have 
an internal team were in an organization with fewer than 500 employees, 
and represented 70% of those reporting that they didnt have enough 
need. Smaller organizations may not be able to justify the resources 
required to have an in\-house team. Their needs may be adequately met 
by third party services, since their IT infrastructures arent as large, so 
testing is not such a time consuming effort (Figure 13\).

Staffing Challenges
Figure 14:Reasons for not having an in\-house pen testing team
There are many reasons cited for not having an in\-house penetration 
testing team. 40% cited lack of talent and 42% cited lack of funding, 
which aligns with the ongoing skills shortage in the cybersecurity 
field (Figure 14\). There are not enough experienced pen testers to 
go around, and those that are can be very expensive. This is further 
reflected by the fact that 49% of respondents reported that their staff 
has three years or fewer of experience with pen testing (Figure 15\).60% indicated that technology plays an influence in whether or not 
they have an in\-house team, demonstrating the vital the role pen 
testing tools can play for in\-house pen testing teams (Figure 16\). 
Some tools can help combat the talent obstacle, as they function not 
only as a way to streamline and enhance pen testing efforts, but also 
as a way to standardize testing and enable comparing results.

Purple Teams
Figure 17:Utilization of a purple team approach
Purple teaming, which focuses on aligning the efforts of both red and 
blue teams, creates a communicative joint team that shares the goal 
of improving security. 39% of respondents reported that they have 
already implemented the approach (Figure 17\).
Considering the amount of resourcestime, money, and 
personnelneeded to institute this approach, this number is 
surprisingly high. Respondents may only be using purple teams for 
small engagements.
These responses imply that the idea of purple teaming is becoming 
more widely accepted as best practice, and that it is not a 
disagreement on strategy, but rather the amount of effort needed to 
implement a comprehensive purple team exercise that is the main 
inhibiting factor. This move towards purple teams, even for small 
engagements, is positive, since purple teams are more collaborative 
and make testing efforts even more effective with unified, cohesive 
plans, goals, and strategies.

Penetration Testing Tools
Figure 18:Active use of penetration testing software
Nearly all respondents indicated that they use penetration testing 
tools of some kind, and 72% of respondents noted that they used 
free andor open source tools (Figure 18\). This falls in line with 
the common practice of multiple tools that meet different needs. 
For example, commercial testing tools, used by nearly 50% of 
respondents, can provide commercial\-grade exploits that open source 
tools may not be able to offer.Using a combination of both open 
source and commercial tools aligns with the 62% of respondents that 
indicated cost as an important consideration (Figure 19\). 
Using a variety of tools also appears to be a practical solution 
given how important features were noted to be when evaluating 
a tool (83%), and the wide range of features respondents consider 
important when looking for in a pen testing tool (Figure 19\).
Among the most desired features were templatesautomation 
capabilities, an extensive threat library, and multi\-vector testing 
capabilities. Reporting was the most popular, with 69% of 
respondents listing it as an important feature (Figure 20\). This 
may be due to compliance needs, which often require extensive 
documentation to prove adherence to certain regulations and 
industry practices. Reporting is also an arduous, time\-consuming task, 
so good reporting functionality can streamline things considerably.

Conclusion
Without penetration testing, how do you know if youre at risk? 
As scary as it can be to find out that you have dangerous security 
weaknesses, the only way to eliminate them is to know they are 
there in the first place. Penetration testing remains the best way to 
keep ahead of adversaries by allowing you to uncover vulnerabilities 
before they can.
The goal of this survey was to provide visibility into how 
cybersecurity professionals are utilizing pen testing. The results 
revealed the wide range of ways that people pen test, indicating 
that any organization can tailor a program to suit their needs and 
available resources. Third party services are a great option for smaller 
organizations who may not yet be able to have someone internal 
dedicated full time, but they are also ideal for larger organizations 
with in\-house teams who need external validation or simply a second 
pair of eyes. In\-house teams can take many different shapessmall, 
large, experienced, novice. Tools are also versatile, and organizations 
typically use more than one to get all the features they want and 
need. There are any number of combinations of tools that can be 
paired together to create a unique suite that ensures a team can 
imitate any type of attacker. 
Though pen testing programs are not without their challenges, the 
amount of options available enable security teams to tweak and 
adjust things as needed to get the most out of their efforts. Having 
such flexibility in how an organization can put together a pen testing 
program will allow the practice of pen testing to continue to thrive as 
long as threat actors continue to attack.
