While excitement and budgets are rising for cutting\-edge 
security programmes, progress on actually improving 
security is sluggish, even stagnant. 
PwCs 2024 Global Digital Trust Insights survey of 3,876 
business and tech executives at the largest global 
companies 30% of respondents have revenues of 
$10 billion or more shows considerable room for 
improvement in cybersecurity. 
Consider these findings. Breach costs and the number 
of high\-dollar breaches continue to increase. Although 
cloud attacks are the top cyber concern, about one\-
third of organisations have no risk management plan to 
address cloud service provider challenges. Only half are 
very satisfied with their technology capabilities in key 
cybersecurity areas. More than 30% of companies dont 
consistently follow what should be standard practices of 
cyber defence. 
Security at the epicenter of innovation: Thats not 
the world we live in today, but what if it were?
Imagine a world with security at the epicenter 
of innovation the field where bright ideas and 
bold ambitions flourish. Imagine the CISO right 
there, working to secure the organisations lofty 
ambitions and prized assets.We note 179 respondents who seem to be doing just that. 
These top 5% our stewards of digital trust are reaping 
benefits that others are missing. Theyre experiencing fewer 
breaches, and the attacks that do hit them arent as costly. 
Managing risk is easier because theyve streamlined their 
security solutions. And theyve positioned themselves 
for greater productivity and faster growth, outpacing the 
competition as they plunge into new technologies with 
confidence that they are well protected.

With technology now at the heart of business, safeguarding 
it is tantamount to protecting the enterprise. Thats why in 
2023, PwC created a playbook for C\-level executives to help 
each C\-level executive focus on the questions they need to 
answer with their CISO. 
Weve updated the playbook for 2024\. This is likely to be 
a watershed year. Cybersecurity faces four major shifts, 
each of which could be disruptive on its own.
 
C\-suite insistence on modernising and improving 
technology infrastructure and investments in a year of 
cost\-cutting and macroeconomic uncertainty.
 
The rise of hybrid cyber threats and the blurring of the 
line between espionage and cybercrime, propelling cyber 
defence more fully into the national security arena.

Cyber risk management: Ripe for reinvention
Innovation means making bold moves, and theres 
nothing more empowering than knowing that youve 
done whats possible to remain safe and secure that 
youve assessed and addressed your most important 
cyber risks.
Mitigating cyber risk is a top priority for 2024, according 
to PwCs 2024 Global Digital Trust Insights survey. After 
dropping to fourth place in last years PwC CEO Survey, its 
now second for our respondents, behind only digital and 
Digital tops the risk list in two ways
technology risks on the list of prioritized risks. And in the 
minds of our respondents, digital and technology risks are 
inextricable from cyber risk.
In todays business climate, we simply cant talk about 
digital transformation or reinvention without mentioning 
cybersecurity in the same breath. Cloud attacks and attacks 
on connected devices are the cyber threats our respondents 
are most concerned about two technologies at the heart of 
business transformation today.

These cyber threats themselves are connected. Once 
malicious actors break into systems and networks, they often 
wreak havoc in as many ways as possible.
What may start as a cloud breach could very well become 
an advanced persistent threat as bad actors lurk inside your 
system collecting data and looking for other ways to do harm. 
They might exfiltrate your data, then launch a ransomware 
attack, then leak the data (hack and leak) even if you pay the 
ransom.
Any one of these incidents would be problematic on its 
own. Taken all together, they can devastate your business 
operations and your reputation. Mega breaches are increasing 
in number and scale and cost. The percentage of those 
reporting costs of $1 million or more for their worst breach in 
the past three years rose to 36% from 27% last year. 
The pace of business reinvention and innovation using 
technology is not slowing down. Not when 40% of CEOs 
think their companies may no longer be economically viable 
a decade from now if they stay on their current path. The 
C\-suite challenge is this: Is your organisations cyber risk 
management keeping up with the changes?The C\-suite challenge is this: Is your organisations

Modernisation and optimisation top the cyber\-investment 
priorities for 2024\. Nearly half (49%) of the business leaders 
selected technology modernisation, including cyber 
infrastructure, and 45% chose optimisation of existing 
technologies and investments. 
In our 2022 survey we found that CEOs in particular were 
very concerned that their organisations had become too 
complex to secure. At that time, 32% had consolidated 
technology vendors in an effort to simplify, as well as realign 
their mix of managed and in\-house services. 
In the 2024 survey, 44% report using an integrated suite of 
cyber tech solutions, and 39% plan to move to one in the 
next two years. Nearly one\-fifth 19% say they have too 
many cyber solutions and need to consolidate. 
An overabundance of point solutions may be one reason 
why only 5% of IT and tech respondents say theyre very 
satisfied with the technology capabilities of their cyber 
solutions in all eight key areas. Software that doesnt work 
together can hinder performance, require more time to 
manage and impede the big\-picture view thats essential to 
managing cyber risk.Those whove already been hit know this. Our 
survey respondents who have had data breaches 
costing $1 million or more in the past three years 
are more likely to acknowledge that they have too 
many cybersecurity solutions and need to integrate 
them. On the other hand, organisations that use 
cohesive cyber\-solution suites are more often able 
to avoid the big, costly breaches.

Still, survey respondents arent pulling in the reins on 
spending. More than three\-quarters (79%) say theyll increase 
their cyber expenditures in 2024 (up from 64% last year), 
especially large organisations with revenues of $5 billion 
or more. Those planning larger budget increases of more 
than 15% tend to be enterprises with $50 billion or more in 
revenues, or in tech, media and telecom industries, or those 
that project higher revenue growth in the next year. 
Cyber investments are also making up a larger 
proportion of the total IT, OT and automation budget. 
Were seeing a mean increase overall to 14% in 2024 
versus 11% for 2023\.The C\-suite challenge isnt a lack of tools or a 
lack of investment. Instead, its figuring out how 
your organisation can reap the benefits of your 
investments. Is your IT architecture too complex to 
adequately protect? Are you making it easy for threat 
actors to find gaps in your defence?

Many of our respondents 42% use more than one 
cloud, and concerns over cloud security increase among 
users of multiple hybrid clouds. Fifty\-four percent
of these respondents cite cloud as their most pressing
cybersecurity risk. Hybrid cloud users are also the most likely 
to select cloud among their top three priorities for security 
investments over the next year (36% as opposed
to 33% overall).
But nearly every organisation 97% has gaps in its 
cloud risk management plan. Only 3% maintain up\-to\-
date plans that address all nine cloud security areas. Risks 
posed by fragmented regulations, for instance, have yet to 
be addressed by 42%; 41% have no plan for dealing with 
concentration risk; 36% havent yet addressed third\-party

Platforms are licensing their large language models (LLMs) 
in tandem with their cyber tech solutions. Microsoft Security 
Copilot intends to provide GenAI features for security posture 
management, incident response and security reporting. 
Google announced Security AI Workbench for similar use 
cases.
Many vendors are pushing the limits of GenAI, testing whats 
possible. It could be some time before we see broad\-scale 
use of defenceGPTs. In the meantime, here are the three 
most promising areas for using GenAI in cyber defence. 
 
Threat detection and analysis. GenAI can be 
invaluable for proactively detecting vulnerability exploits, 
rapidly assessing their extent whats at risk, whats 
already compromised and what the damages are, and 
then presenting tried\-and\-true options for defence and 
remediation. GenAI can help identify patterns, anomalies 
and indicators of compromise that elude traditional 
signature\-based detection systems. 
The C\-suite challenge is this: How do you wield 
the new tools without inviting new risks to flare up in 
the organisation and in society? What should you do 
to use GenAI ethically and responsibly?
 
Cyber risk and incident reporting. GenAI might also 
make cyber risk and incident reporting much simpler. 
With the help of natural language processing (NLP), 
GenAI can turn technical data into concise content that 
nontechnical people can understand. It can help with 
incident response reporting, threat intelligence, risk 
assessments, audits and regulatory compliance. And it 
can present its recommendations in terms that anyone 
can understand, even translating confounding graphs 
into simple text.
 
Adaptive controls. Securing the cloud and software 
supply chain requires constant updates in security 
policies and controls a daunting task today. Machine 
learning algorithms and GenAI tools could soon 
recommend, validate and draft security policies and 
automate controls that are tailored to an organisations 
threat profile, technologies and business objectives.

The mainstream view is that new rules and regulations 
hinder revenues, but heres the take of at least one\-third 
of respondents: The guardrails regulators put up can give 
companies added confidence to explore, experiment, invent 
and compete. Navigating regulatory requirements can 
become a competitive advantage for leading companies.
About a third of this years respondents agree that four 
types of regulation will be most important to securing the 
future growth of their organisation regulation of AI (37%), 
harmonisation of cyber and data protection laws (36%), 
Regulations: Providing a safe place to play and grow
mandatory reporting of cyber risk management, strategy and 
governance (35%) and operational resilience requirements 
(32%).
Transparency is the regulatory drumbeat that will grow louder 
around the world. New SEC rules require public disclosure of 
cybersecurity breaches deemed to have a potential material 
effect on investors. The Digital Markets Act and the Digital 
Services Act require transparency in data practices and 
algorithmic decision\-making. And regulations are on the 
horizon governing AI including an EU AI Act in the works 
and GenAI regulation.

Operational resilience is another important theme. Regulators 
know that its a big risk to approach the challenge of 
interrelated and complex risks as many C\-suite teams still 
habitually do as a silo\-based exercise that treats each 
business units risk profile as separate. New requirements 
such as the Digital Operational Resilience Act will 
increasingly insist on integrated resilience with core elements 
that make an organisation adaptive, flexible and stronger 
after every disruptive event.
As many as three\-quarters expect that compliance with these 
regulations will require significant outlays of money and time. 
Incurring high costs and revenue impacts may be avoidable, 
The slow progress on cyber resilience
if businesses involve themselves early and often in regulatory 
processes meeting with law enforcement, for example, 
participating in public comments and even taking a seat at 
the table with regulators to help craft or influence proposed 
directives.
The C\-suite challenge is this: Amid regulatory 
uncertainty, can you give your organisation the 
room to innovate while keeping security and privacy 
by design? How do you turn this new regulatory 
environment as a source of competitive advantage?
Identifying critical business processes
Implementing cyber recovery technology solutions (including 
immutable backups isolated recovery environment)
Developing cyber recovery playbook for IT\-loss scenarios
Establishing protocols with major technology providers (cloud, device 
manufacturers, managed services) to coordinate incident responses

and projects that dont produce the results you want. 
These stumbling blocks and others remain in the way of 
cybersecurity thats truly trustworthy.
In the 2023 playbook, we identified critical challenges that 
C\-suite executives should address together, as partners. 
These are still relevant.

In 2024, were raising
the challenge:
Do you dare, as a C\-suite leader, to

blocking your company from its goals? 
We see some enterprises already 
picking their best bets. The array of

Placing yourself at the epicenter of innovation means meeting 
your leadership teams where they are and helping them to 
overcome the intimidation they might feel regarding what 
you do. Using insider terms such as cyber landscape, attack 
surface and even zero trust can only further mystify those 
outside your profession. 
Speak a new language.
Dare to talk about cyber in business\-speak, tech\-speak, 
finance\-speak or everyday\-speak. Speak to your customers, 
investors and business partners in annual security reports in 
ways that inform and engage. Using common vocabularies 
can help executives wrestle with the trade\-offs, tensions and 
chaos that inevitably happen at the epicenter of innovation.
Use more sophisticated approaches to cyber\-risk modeling 
such as scanning for threats using formulas specific to your 
companys sector, vision and strategy. Create a risk\-linked 
performance incentive for every bonus\-eligible employee in 
the company, to build a risk culture. Invent new ways to find

and strengthen your weaknesses, perhaps with a modern 
bug bounty programme that incentivises independent 
security research. Finally procure and begin using a cloud\-
first, centrally managed identity solution to secure your 
business expansion goals. 
Speak the language of trust, not just regulatory compliance. 
Involve yourself early and often for the better chance at 
influencing any new rules and ensuring that they boost, not 
hinder, business success. AI, the metaverse, cryptocurrency, 
privacy these hot regulatory topics could well benefit from 
your experience and insights. Remember, regulators can feel 
as befuddled as anyone by the workings of cyber and tech.
Shape guardrails.
