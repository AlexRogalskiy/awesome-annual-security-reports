Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|2Introduction \& 
Executive SummarySecurity, agility, and visibility how are data leaders prioritizing these initiativesto protect and strengthen their businesses in 2024?Generative AI has opened up a vast new world of productivity, possibility, and mostcritically, risk. AI models and use cases are being built, deployed, and restructuredwithin a span of just months. The rate of technological innovation has left many dataleaders weighing the balance between substantial gains and frightening setbacks.In an effort to develop an authentic understanding of the current moment,we surveyed 700\+ data platform and security leaders who are asking todays mostpressing questions: How should I allocate my tech and human resources to optimize our data security?
 How can I improve my data team reporting structure?
 How are others navigating organizational, technological, and process\-level security risks?
 How can my actions as a data leader directly drive better business outcomes?
 What pressing needs and data security priorities should be top of mind for me?This survey reveals the concerns, responsibilities, and real\-time decisions of dataprofessionals who are facing an exciting yet unknown future.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|3
Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|3Key Insights01AI Brings Great Excitement and RiskIn 2023, AI went from a trending topic to an organizational imperative, and data expertsfrom across industries expect that perspective to extend far beyond 2024\. As adoptioncontinues, the savviest organizations will roll out AI data protections as part of an overalldata strategy to reduce the risks of AI. 88% of data professionals say employees at their organizations are using AI, but only 50% 
say their organizations data security strategy is keeping up with the AIs rate of evolution. 56% of data professionals say their top concern with AI is the risk of sensitive data exposurevia an AI prompt. Still, just 20% cite integrating AI into business processes as a top priority in the next year, 
compared to 35% that say implementing stronger data governance and security controls isthe most significant initiative.02Seamless Collaboration Is a Key
Component of Data SecurityAs more people utilize and access data across cloud data warehouses, lakehouses, anddata mesh architectures, there are more stakeholders to manage. As a result, datasecurity will continue to fall on the shoulders of everyone in the organization, not just onedepartment or a team of IT professionals. 80% of respondents store at least half of their data in a cloud\-based platform, and mostplan to continue on this path. 46% of data professionals say that six to 10 people manage security at their organization,and another 33% say that 20 or more people are involved.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|403Despite Data Access Challenges,
Data Leaders are Confident About
Threat ResponseEnabling secure data access remains a priority for data leaders, but security processesoften slow down time\-to\-access and value. Although data leaders agree on the accessmanagement challenge, many are overconfident in their ability to sufficiently respond tothreats. This signals a disconnect if data visibility is stunted, then so is threat visibility. 44% of respondents say it takes a week or more to gain access to a new data set, and 56%agree that data security processes slow down access to data. Although access is a problem, 94% of data professionals express some degree ofconfidence in their ability to detect and sufficiently respond to threats. These findings maysignal overconfidence in the face of access challenges.04Data Security Budgets Are Expected toContinue ClimbingSecurity spending increased in prior years and is expected to escalate. The C\-Suiterecognizes that data security not just cybersecurity in general is a top priority, andthey need more resources and tools to protect their data. 80% of data professionals say their data protection capabilities have improved over thelast year. 77% say their data security budgets have increased over the past year.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|505Data Governance and Security Is a
Bigger Priority Than AI for 2024Implementing stronger data governance and security controls, and modernizing dataarchitectures, are the two top priorities even ahead of AI. It is critical to have a datastrategy before you have an AI strategy. Despite the buzz around AI, data governance and security was the most significant initiativerespondents organizations will take on in the next 12 months.What significant initiatives is your organization

AI Brings Great Excitement 
and RiskThe rapid evolution of AI and ML has left data leaders scrambling to make high\-level decisions about organizational adoption. Nearly nine out of 10 (88%) of dataprofessionals say that their employees are using AI, whether or not the companyhas officially adopted generative AI tools. At the same time, 50% strongly orsomewhat agree that their organizations data security strategy is failing to keep upwith the pace of AI evolution.While AIs presence in the workplace and its rate of change is exciting, data professionals aremore worried about its potential risks. Over half of respondents (56%) cite the exposure ofsensitive data via an AI prompt as their greatest area of concern around AI. Despite this, feworganizations are taking steps to manage this risk through policies and governance.Only 21% of companies that report adopting AI have established policiesfor AI use in the workplace.Source: The state of AI in 2023: Generative AIs breakout year, McKinseyInsights gathered from the survey reveal an interesting paradox: AI is simultaneously perceived asa notable security threat and a remedy.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|9Many data professionals are confident AI will help them become better at things like anomalydetection (44%) and phishing attack identification (46%). Virtually everyone is eager to benefitfrom AI, generative or otherwise, but the risks involved show that not everyone is willing to becomean early adopter.BenefitsRisks1\.Phishing Attack Identification (46%)1\.Inadvertent Exposure of Sensitive2\.Threat Simulation \& Red Teaming (44%)3\.Anomaly Detection (42%)4\.Audits \& Reporting (42%)Information by Employees ViaPrompts (56%)2\.Unauthorized Use of Purpose\-BuiltModels Out\-of\-Context (56%)3\.Inadvertent Exposure of SensitiveInformation by LLMs (53%)4\.Training Data Poisoning (49%)It can be difficult to ensure that sensitive information is protected frompotential data leaks. Additionally, the emergence of generative AI andGPT technologies has brought about new concerns regarding dataprivacy and security.Diego Souza, Chief Information Security Officer at CumminsOrganizations must design AI\-specific security strategies to match the pace of AI evolution andproliferation. Protecting data pipelines that fuel generative AI and its outputs ranks high among toppriorities. Large Language Models (LLMs), which are the foundation of many generative AI tools,pose a wide range of emerging threats, such as: Training\-data poisoning, which occurs when data fed to LLMs is manipulated
 Sensitive data disclosure by LLMs or employees
 Model theft and unauthorized useTo appropriately manage these risks, organizations need to identify, secure, and monitor the datathat goes into their LLMs. Capabilities like data classification and tagging, access control, andauditing all aid in building secure and fine\-tuned LLMs.Building a vast library of AI models or use cases without considering data security could backfire.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|10Data leaders must implement protocols and policies that protect everyone their organization,employees, and sensitive data. With the right policies in place, data teams can confidently positionthemselves to experiment and launch AI models at scale.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|1102
Seamless Collaboration
Is a Key Component of 
Data SecurityData security is a responsibility that must be shouldered by everyone in theorganization; it can no longer fall on one person or department. As more businessesembrace data democratization, data policies and communication guidelines will benecessary to foster safe collaboration.The adoption of advanced frameworks, like data mesh, has accelerated democratization. By givingindividual business domains responsibility for their own data governance, data mesh dispersesdata ownership while increasing collaboration in ways that a traditional, monolithic approach todata management never could.It is clear, then, why data security has become a distributed function. But who is ultimatelyresponsible for driving it?Who manages each of the following at your organization?Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|12Respondents report that the job title most commonly accountable for data security is DataPrivacy or Security Manager (19%) or Chief Technology Officer (15%), with numerous otherroles represented as well.As organizations grow, their structures become more complicated and they manage more data making data security both more important and more challenging. It is not surprising, then, thatdata security teams are growing, too. Nearly half (46%) of data leaders say that six to 10 peoplemanage security for their organization, and another third (33%) say that 20 or more peopleare involved.To avoid major delays in the development cycle or worse, insecure deployments securityis shifting left toward data teams, too. Rather than waiting to discover security issues in theproduction environment, organizations are pushing security testing earlier and implementing datasecurity measures throughout development.Shift left security forces teams and leaders to collaborate on data efforts instead of operating in asilo. When everyone aligns around data security and understands the part they play in reaching acommon goal, organizations more effectively protect their data.As essential as seamless collaboration is for data security, the industry faces a major gapwhen it comes to the tools professionals use.Although security functions are shared across data security, data platforms, and legal orcompliance teams, most tools are not designed with collaboration at the forefront. This makes theimpact of solutions that focus on collaboration profound.With Immuta, weve been able to streamline data science andengineering teamwork, dynamically adapt in real\-time, and accelerateproductivity.Halim Abbas, Chief AI Officer at CognoaOrganizations need more than good intentions to manage security collaboratively. They also needtools and platforms that support cross\-functional data security efforts and strike a good balancebetween accessibility and security.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|1303
Despite Data Access 
Challenges, Data Leaders 
Are Confident About Threat 
ResponseWith the industry\-wide push to migrate data to the cloud, data leaders have foundthemselves between a rock and a hard place. Do they choose data security overprogress and acceleration? Or do they lean into agility, becoming more vulnerable torisks and fines of noncompliance?Organizations require tools that provide both proper data protection and the flexibilityto use data to drive value.Data Access Is Still a Considerable Security 
ChallengeThe industry\-wide challenge of data access is far from novel. The 2023 State of Data EngineeringReport revealed that: 63% of data professionals lacked visibility into data access controls. 
 Nine out of 10 data professionals said they could improve their understanding of thecorrelation between data access and data security.This years findings show that managing data access remains a major security obstacle 33% ofrespondents cited a lack of visibility into data sharing and usage as their biggest securitychallenge. The underlying problem is maintaining and enforcing consistent data security controls.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|14What is the biggest data security challenge within your organization?Recent research from Gartner supports this finding:Maintaining consistent data security is difficult because so manyproducts provide siloed security controls, use proprietary dataclassification, act on specific repositories or processing steps, and donot integrate with each other. This restricts organizations ability toidentify and deploy adequate, and consistent, data security controlswhile balancing the business need to access data throughout its lifecycle.Gartner, Hype Cycle for Data Security, July 2023Yet despite these concerns, a total of 94% of data professionals feel some degree of confidencewhen it comes to detecting and responding to a data threat.This reflects overconfidence from data leaders in the face of continued data access challenges. Ifvisibility is a major issue for at least a third of data leaders, how can 94% of them proactively spotand address threats? Data professionals need streamlined security solutions in place to maintainconfidence and keep data visible and protected.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|15If you dont automate your security and simplify it, the biggest problemyoure going to have is some human making a mistake.Kaj Pedersen, Chief Technology Officer at AstrumUThis overconfidence is also directly at odds with the realities of access challenges. Nearly half ofrespondents (44%) say that accessing a new data set takes a week or more. This substantialdelay inhibits organizations from using data to drive value and business outcomes.How long does it take to get access to a new data set once requested?Slowdowns and Workarounds: The Felt 
Impacts of Data Access IssuesUnsurprisingly, 56% of respondents agree that data security processes slow down access todata. This means that over half of organizations are sacrificing some level of data\-driven value foressential security outcomes trading agility for trust and compliance.This leads many data users to look for workarounds which are inherently risky, even in the mostsecure data environment. More than half of respondents (57%) say that data users fall backon quick fixes to access data outside of proper data access governance practices. This is aReport: 2024 State of Data Security\|16problem that data leaders need to cut off at the source by improving onboarding (and offboarding)processes and building out proper access control measures.Despite respondents confidence in their data access management, more than half (56%) haveexperienced access issues that hinder business operations or outcomes.Compliance: A Moving Target for Data 
LeadersCompliance may be perceived as a peripheral challenge in comparison to data access. Just 12%of respondents cite noncompliance as the biggest security challenge for their organization.But the potential consequences surrounding compliance are mounting especially in the face ofunpredictable AI regulations that organizations cannot yet foresee.Take it from the experts:We are seeing a rise in compliance and privacy regulations. This trendpotentially can slow the ability for an organization to use data, as well asincrease the need for data access and governance solutions to preventany potential fines or enforcement actions.Dave DeWalt, Founder, Managing Director \& CEO of NightDragonMore countries are going to enforce data protection and localizationregulations, slowing down the pace at which the industry is going towant to use data to drive business decisions.Ananth Hegde, Head of Data Engineering, Commercial Bank at JPMorgan ChaseRegulatory changes will only exacerbate existing data access challenges. Three\-quarters ofrespondents say that they are currently subject to 10 or more regulations, which is sure to increasein the coming years.Still, as new regulations unfold, data professionals seem optimistic about compliance. Nearly a third(32%) believe that improved data security will improve compliance for their organization.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|1704
Data Security Budgets 
Are Expected to Continue 
ClimbingOrganizational resources and assets are flowing into the hands of data teams. 91% ofrespondents say they have a documented data strategy in place, and 77% say theirbudgets have increased. Perhaps this accounts for the 80% of data professionalsreporting that their data protection capabilities are better than they were just a yearago, a trend that seems likely to continue into 2024\.Despite this, when it comes to the tools at their disposal, the majority of respondents are lookingfor something better.More than half (57%) of respondents say that their tools and tech definitely need improvement.When enterprises decide to shift data to the cloud or implement a data mesh approach, theyimplement security strategies to protect their organization through these changes. But by thetime theyre ready to go to production, they already need new security strategies in placethatshow quickly strategies need to evolve. As budgets, processes, and regulations shift over time, datateams need data security platforms and tools to shift and scale with them.Vineeth Menon, Head of Data Lake Engineering at Swedbank, described his organizationspriorities this way:Swedbank needed to build an enterprise\-scale advanced analyticsplatform that would also enforce trust in our security, management, andaccess to data internally while protecting our customers assets anddata.With such multi\-faceted needs for data security and access, leaders are choosing platforms thatcan support those needs.Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|18Among our respondents, the most commonly used data platforms were:1\.Azure Synapse (26%)2\.Databricks (16%)3\.Google BigQuery (15%)Comparing this data to our 2021 Impact Report, it is clear that most organizations adopted (and stilluse) the tools they planned on three years ago and time to insight and collaboration remain theirtop priorities for cloud\-based platforms.Planned Adoption vs. Most Commonly Used PlatformsReport: 2024 State of Data Security\|1905
Data Governance and
Security Is a Bigger Priority 
Than AI for 2024According to this survey, the two top priorities for next year are (1\) implementingstronger data governance and security controls, and (2\) modernizing dataarchitectures. AI is number three.The Gartner Chief Data \& Analytics Officer Agenda Survey for 2023 had a similar finding, showingthat the top three critical enablers for success were:1\.Governance2\.BI and reporting3\.Data literacy4\.AIMLWithout the foundation of a strong data architecture and the proper data protections in place, it isimpossible to safely integrate AI.If polling a business audience, the responses may have been flipped given the news cycles spent onGen AI. Gen AI is certainly exciting. However, we have to give the data professionals who respondedto this survey credit for prioritizing the data hygiene required to be successful long term.In the age of cloud and AI, data security and governance complexitiesare mounting. Its simply not possible to use legacy approaches tomanage data security across hundreds of products.Sanjeev Mohan, Principal at SanjMoReport: 2024 State of Data Security\|20The truth is that AI will never go from science project to production unless organizations canfeel safe doing so. In another research report, Gartner predicts that, By 2027, at least one globalcompany will see its AI deployment banned by a regulator for noncompliance with data protectionor AI governance legislation (Gartner, Security Leaders Guide to Data Security, September 2023\).Over a third of respondents (35%) say the major initiative their organization will take on in the nextyear is the implementation of stronger governance and security controls.What significant initiatives is your organization 
taking on in the next 12 months?It is perhaps worth asking whether AI itself is a driver for better security and governance. By puttingtools like ChatGPT in the hands of everyday users, questions about personal data and businesssecrets have become hot conversations. We are entering a landscape where data and its uses areall democratized. One thing is certain securing data across this complex landscape requires a newset of tools.Organizations must foster data democratization by prioritizing providersthat amplify data literacy and enable self\-service data access.The Forrester Wave: Data Governance Solutions, Q3 2023Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|212024 and Beyond: No Cons 
to Investing in Data SecurityThe pace of change has left data leaders and professionals clinging to the one truth that likelywont change for years to come: trust, security, and compliance are invaluable.It comes as no surprise, then, that an overwhelming majority (88%) of data leaders believe thatdata security will become an even higher priority in the next 12 months. From AI advancementsto shifting regulations, data professionals are rightly noting how important data security will bethrough the changing tides.The future of our business depends on making our data and AI initiativessuccessful.Jochen Kaiser, Department Lead for Data Ecosystem at Mercedes\-Benz GroupIn 2024, one\-third (32%) of respondents expect the top benefit of improved data security tobe improved compliance. Nearly one\-quarter (23%) of data professionals cite faster access todata as the top benefit.Over the next 12 months, how do you expect your 
organizations to benefit by improving data security?Report: 2024 State of Data Security\|22Here are our top four recommendations for data leaders in 2024:1\.Develop a long\-term data strategy ASAP: Frameworks and guidelines serve as the confidentconstant that grounds all other elements subject to change. Governance, AI, and securitythreats will continue to introduce unknown variables into organizational strategy. Those whoinvest the time and resources into high\-level strategy today will have a stronger foothold in 2024\.2\.Ensure collaborative systems are in place: Do what you can to eliminate obstacles tocollaboration. Its vital that CISOs, CDOs, and other data stakeholders can work togetherseamlessly, no matter where they are in the world and no matter if the data is stored in clouddata warehouses, lakehouses, or data mesh architectures. The ROI on business intelligence anddata\-informed decisions will only increase.3\.Craft a plan to assess and address potential data access issues: Data security is dynamic. Itrequires consistent monitoring, maintenance, and oversight. Make it a priority in 2024 to speedup time\-to\-access for your overall organization without compromising governance. This is a tallorder, but teams who strike a balance between data visibility, risk mitigation, and accessibility willnot only be the most secure, but also the most efficient.4\.Place the right big bets on your data platform: The savviest data professionals are not tryingto juggle security, agility, and visibility on their own.

Both terms refer to an organizations policies andprocedures that facilitate data access. There are particular models for data access, such as Role\-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute\-Based Access Control (ABAC). This term refers to theimplementation of those models and the management of the policies, including how they are stored,executed, and monitored.Data mesh: Data mesh is a modern data architecture design that decentralizes data ownership,leaving data governance and quality in the hands of self\-contained domains. Built to meet the needsof hybrid and multi\-cloud data environments, data mesh reduces data silos and bottlenecks, andputs data in the hands of those who need it.Generative AI: Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to createand output various content types, including text, images, graphics, audio, and video.Large Language Model: A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model knownfor its natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. LLMs are trained using massive data sets, andcan both understand humans and generate conversational responses to questions or prompts.Machine Learning: Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses data andalgorithms to train machines to learn as humans do. ML plays an emerging role in the data sciencefield, as algorithms learn to review large data sets then identify patterns, predict outcomes, andmake classifications.Shift left: The shift left approach to security introduces security measures and testing early in thedevelopment cycle to avoid major delays or expensive errors due to security or compliance gaps. 2023 Immuta, Inc.
