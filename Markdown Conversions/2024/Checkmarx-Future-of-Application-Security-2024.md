REP ORTThe Future ofAPPLICATION
SECURITY 2024The State of 
Application 
SecurityApplication development has changed.It has moved from waterfall development with infrequent releases, 
to agile development and continuous delivery. Software is deployed 
multiple times per day, development is complex, and it is increasingly 
cloud\-native. This has dramatically changed how organizations need 
to secure their applications.There is more software deployed 
in more environments, 
and less time available to secure it.Theresponsibilityhasshiftedawayfromdedicated 
security teams and is now shared between AppSec 
managersanddevelopers.TrustbetweenCISOs, 
development and security teams \- called \#DevSecTrust 
\-iscriticaliftheenterprisegoingtosuccessfully 
reducethebusinessriskofvulnerableapplications.Building \#DevSecTrust requires a holistic approach. 
CISOs must understand the issues facing their AppSec 
and development teams while trying to gain greater 
visibilityovertheirenterprisesAppSec.AppSec 
tools must meet the needs of multiple stakeholders, 
andtherisinginfluenceofdevelopersmustbe 
recognized if organizations are going to successfully 
continue to improve their application security posture.The third annual Future of Application Security survey 
reveals how key stakeholders are responding to this 
challenge. We surveyed 1504 developers, CISOs, and 
AppSec managers from a broad range of industries 
across the US, Europe, and Asia\-Pacific regions.Discoverthecurrentstateofapplicationsecurity

AppSec program. Alignment and trust between CISOs, 
AppSec professionals, and developers is necessary to 
identify and address vulnerabilities that could impact the 
business. Yet, there are some differences between CISOs, 
AppSec managers, and developers. Developers and AppSec 
managers focus on the things that are in their immediate 
control, while CISOs seem to take a more holistic approach 
to AppSec.3Developer influence is rising, 
making developer experience 
more importantDevelopers are increasingly powerful decision\-makers 
in the buying process. Developer experience is a crucial 
when considering in any AppSec solution, with vulnerability 
prioritization, secure code training, and seamless AppSec 
integration all key focus areas.Main breach causesStolen credentials,secrets,

CISOs say managing cloud risk is their top priority in the coming
