VP Research, Check PointWelcome to the Check Point 2024 Cyber Security Report. In 2023, the world of cybersecurity witnessed significant changes, with the nature and scale of cyber attacksevolving rapidly. This year, we saw cyber threats stepping out from the shadows of theonline world into the spotlight, grabbing the attention of everyone from governmentagencies to the general public.The reasons behind these attacks have become as varied as the methods used.Ransomware remained a major threat, with attackers not just after money, but alsoseeking recognition. Ransomware attacks exploiting zero\-day vulnerabilities whileusing shame sites for publicly revealing who their victims are became more popular,turning ransomware into a sort of competition among cybercriminals. The cost ofthese attacks went beyond just paying the ransom, with companies like MGM, DP World,and the British Library facing huge expenses to rebuild their systems.We also saw an increase in hacktivism, where hackers are driven by political or socialcauses. This type of hacking, once a tool for individual activists, is now being used bygovernments as a way to attack adversaries indirectly. This was especially noticeablein the wake of events like the Russo\-Ukraine war and the Israel\-Hamas conflict.Attackers found new ways to break into systems, with devices like routers and switchesbecoming easy targets. Big organizations, including Okta and 23AndMe, were hit byattacks that used stolen login details or malicious software.Artificial Intelligence (AI) played a bigger role in cyber attacks this year. Attackersstarted using AI tools to make their phishing campaigns more effective. However, thegood news is that AI is also being used by cyber defenders to better protect againstthese threats.5CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R1There were some wins against cybercriminals too. Law enforcement agencies, includingthe FBI, made progress in taking down major threats like the Hive Ransomware networkand the Qbot infrastructure. But the comeback of some of these groups reminds us thatthe fight against cybercrime is ongoing.This report looks back at the major cyber security events of 2023, offering insights andanalysis to help understand and prepare for the challenges ahead. Our goal is to providevaluable information to organizations, policy makers, and cyber security professionals,helping them to build stronger defenses in an increasingly digital world.We hope you find this report informative and useful in your efforts to keep your digitalenvironments secure.Maya HorowitzVP Research at Check Point Software Technologies6CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R20

DevicesOften under\-prioritized in security strategies, edgedevices have long been exploited by cybercriminalsto setup botnets for DDoS attacks and to orchestratespam campaigns.In an ongoing trend that has reached its zenith thisyear, edge devices have become the target ofnation\-state APTs and financially motivated advancedthreat actors, who are using them either as a partof a sophisticated exfiltration infrastructure or asentry points for penetrating broader network systemsof carefully selected entities and devices. Initiallyleveraged by state actors using expensive zero\-dayexploits and custom\-made malware, this strategyhas since been adopted by financially motivatedsophisticated groups who exploit misconfigurationsand known vulnerabilities in unpatched systems forransomware attacks.Edge devices like routers, switches, VPN hardwareand security appliances are often neglectedin security analyses.

In a sophisticated cyber\-attackdiscovered in July, the Chinese APT group knownas Storm\-0558 successfully compromisedmultiple email accounts belonging to at least25 organizations, including several U.S. Federalagencies. This breach was achieved by exploitinga stolen Microsoft account (MSA) consumersigning key. This key, integral to Microsoft'ssecurity infrastructure, is used to digitally signand authenticate tokens during the login processto consumers' Microsoft accounts. According toMicrosoft's findings, the attack most likely beganwith the compromise of a Microsoft engineer'saccount, which gave the attackers access to38CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R3the engineer's debugging environment. Withinthis environment, the attackers located an MSAkey that was inadvertently left in an unsanitizedcrash dump.

However, theaverage educational institution is still hit with over 2,000 attack attempts weekly. Some attacks havebeen part of larger campaigns, such as those involving Johns Hopkins University and the UniversitySystem of Georgia, which were compromised by the CL0P ransomware through the MOVEit managedfile transfer software.50CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R4Schools are particularly vulnerable to cyber\-attacks due to the vast amounts of sensitive personalinformation they have in their systems and lower levels of investment in cybersecurity. The privatesectorincluding retail, wholesale manufacturing, and financial institutionsis more likely toacquiesce to ransom demands than public sector groups, and has seen an increase in targeting overthe previous year. Access to these institutions is often traded in underground markets.Figure 9: Postings in an underground for um selling access to retail companies.In 2023, the cybersecurity landscape experienced a worrying surge in ransomware attacks acrossvarious sectors. Ransomware attacks now account for 10% of all malware types detected byCheck Point sensors. This trend is further underscored by CPIRT (Check Point Incident ResponseTeam) data and victim postings on ransomware shame sites. According to CPIRT data, nearly halfof all of the incidents they handled involved ransomware and the reported number of ransomwarevictims has reached nearly 5,000 victims, a marked increase from the 2,600 reported in 2022\.51CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024

Eighty\-eight percent ofall malicious file deliveries occur through email, with the remainder downloaded directly from theinternet. Threat actors have adapted to email protection strategies and are exploring innovativedelivery techniques. Following Microsofts restrictions on Office VBA macros in files from externalsources denoted with the Mark\-of\-the\-Web (MotW), there was a sharp decrease in the prevalenceof malicious Office files, from nearly 50% in 2022 to 2% in 2023\. Notable alternative attack vectorsinclude HTML files and various archive file types. In particular, the exploitation of HTML files saw asignificant uptick. HTML files comprise 69% of all malicious file attachments.Threat actors use HTML files in several ways. They are used in phishing schemes to imitate legitimatewebsite login pages and steal user credentials. They can include malicious JavaScripts or exploits tounpatched browser and browser\-plugins. As demonstrated in recent CP research, these tacticsare not limited to low\-level criminals but are also utilized by advanced APT actors. Other uses ofHTML include HTML smuggling, or auto download for executables and redirections to other maliciousURLs. Legitimate use cases of email\-delivered HTML are unusual and therefore organizations shouldconsider implementing restrictions.54CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R4Utilization of various archive files has also been on the rise. The contents of password\-protectedarchives are hidden from many security services, thus forming an effective attack vector. Otherformats like .img and .iso depend on the software used for their extraction to propagate the MotWfunctionality, which is used to prevent malicious attempts. While Microsoft has fixed this feature,other providers like 7\-zip have opt\-in policies, thus decreasing the effectiveness of the MotWprotection mechanism.The increased detection of malicious .py files, ranking fourth in the list of the most commonweb\-delivered malicious file types, indicates a rising use of malicious code packages. This trend isexplored in detail in a separate section. The continued decrease in the use of executables as maliciousemail attachments, which dropped from 26% in 2022 to just 3% in the past year, can be attributedto restrictive corporate policies, the integration of security mechanisms by popular email serviceproviders, such as Google and Microsoft, and enhanced user awareness.55CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024

Also known as SocGholish, it relies on a network of compromised websites toredirect users to fake software and browser updates. In turn, these fake updates trick users intodownloading and executing a JavaScript downloader that acts as the initial access point, enableingfurther compromise through other malware such as GootLoader, NetSupport and DoppelPaymer.The network of compromised websites is linked to TA569, a prolific threat actor who serves as anInitial Access Broker (IAB).TA569 is suspected of selling initial access to malware victims in a pay\-per\-install (PPI) pricing model toother cybercriminals who can then leverage compromised systems to deploy ransomware. The infectionchain begins when a victim visits a compromised website, whether they were lured there by a phishingemail or they access it directly. On the website itself, the victim may encounter a fake browser updaterequest, or fake Captcha puzzles, and security software updates, then leading to malware infection.Qbot, also known as QakBot or PinkslipBot, ranks second on our list. Qbot is a Windows malwarethat was first discovered in 2008 as a banking Trojan. Through many updates and evolutions, it hasbecome one of the most well\-known and longest\-prevailing malware droppers out there. In fact,Qbot has caused so much damage in terms of data theft and extortion, that in August 2023 the FBIand the Department of Justice launched an international campaign to dismantle the botnet, removeit from infected servers and seize over $8 million in illicit profits. In December, Qbot was observedin new phishing campaigns.Emotet has long persisted on Check Points most prevalent malware list. Despite its dilutedoperational mode, it affected 4% of corporate networks globally, mostly in the first quarter ofthe year. Emotet was taken down in a Europol\-led global effort in November 2021, but made ameasured comeback in 2022, orchestrated by the cybercrime group Mealybug (AKA TA542\)through multiple spam campaigns alternating with prolonged periods of silence.After Microsoft restricted the exploitation of VBA macros in downloaded documents (the principalmethod used in Emotets campaign), Mealybug went on to explore alternative infection methods.In 2023, Mealybug was observed trying out different techniques, and in March began usingVBScript\-embedded OneNote files in their campaigns. Upon downloading the file, the victims werelured to click the View button to see the document contents, which would then download theEmotet DLL. This campaign was planned to coincide with tax season deadlines in the United States.58CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R4TOP MULTIPURPOSE MALWAREGLOBALAMERICAS44%FakeUpdatesQbotEmotetMiraiUrsnifRamnitOther21%17%3%4%8%3%23%19%40%FakeUpdatesQbotEmotetMiraiGluptebaRaspberry RobinOther3%3%4%8%Figure 18: Most prevalent multipurpose malwareFigure 19: Most prevalent multipurpose malwareglobally2023in the Americas2023EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (EMEA)ASIA PACIFIC (APAC)23%19%FakeUpdates38%QbotEmotetUrsnifMiraiPhorpiexOther3%4%5%9%17%48%13%6%6%5%5%FakeUpdatesQbotRamnitEmotetDarkGatePhorpiexOtherFigure 20: Most prevalent multipurpose malwareFigure 21: Most prevalent multipurpose malwarein EMEA2023in APAC202359CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R4MULTIPURPOSE MALWARE GLOBAL ANALYSISAs in our previous report, we have merged two malware categories, banking Trojans and botnetsand introduced instead a new unified category called 'multipurpose malware'. This change reflectsthe evolution of many banking Trojans, which have acquired additional functionalities.In addition to FakeUpdates, Qbot, and Emotet, which were discussed in the previous section,DarkGate, a Windows RAT developed in Delphi, has also risen in popularity and is especiallyprominent in campaigns targeting entities in the APAC region. In the latter half of 2023, DarkGategained significant notoriety for its ability to evade security system detection. In contrast to Emotetand Qbot, which run their own infection campaigns and subsequently sell access and infections,DarkGate employed a more direct sales strategy in a Malware\-as\-a\-Service (MaaS) model. It wasdirectly advertised on underground forums to a select group of customers, highlighting its newcapabilities and limited availability.

At the heart of this ecosystem are MaaS providers, who focus ondeveloping and maintaining both the malware and its operational infrastructure. Infostealeroperators, who either rent or purchase the malware, deploy them in cyber\-attack campaignsagainst victim platforms. Underground marketplaces are crucial for trading the data harvestedfrom these campaigns.In the past year, this ecosystem has seen only minimal changes, with malware such as AgentTesla,FormBook, and LokiBot remaining prevalent. The accessibility of these infostealers is evident intheir pricing on underground forums, where they are offered for monthly subscriptions ranging from$60 to $1,000 USD. This tiered pricing structure accommodates a wide spectrum of threat actors,from novices to seasoned hackers. In addition, there are the Initial Access Brokers, who utilize thepurchased data to breach networks, often leading to extensive exploitation by ransomware.AgentTesla, first identified in 2014, is a MaaS with keylogging capabilities and is one of theinfostealers commonly detected by CP. Its current version has been enhanced to stealcredentials from multiple applications, including web browsers, VPN software, FTP services,and email clients. Beyond credential theft, AgentTesla has functionalities for collecting systeminformation, disabling anti\-malware processes, and capturing clipboard contents. AgentTesla isadept at extracting credentials from system registries and configuration files, and it transmitsthis stolen data to its command and control (C\&C) server. Notably, this malware is marketed onunderground forums through low\-cost subscription models, making it accessible to cybercriminalswith limited technical expertise.62CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R4TOP CRYPTOMINING MALWAREGLOBALAMERICAS12%3%4%8%8%65%XMRigRubyMinerLemonDuckLuciferWannamineOther4%11%XMRigRubyMinerLemonDuckWannamineLuciferOther1%6%1%75%Figure 27: Top cryptomining malware globally2023Figure 28: Top cryptomining malware in the Americas2023EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (EMEA)ASIA PACIFIC (APAC)16%1%2%5%8%69%XMRigRubyMinerLemonDuckLuciferWannamineOther10%6%7%9%13%XMRigLemonDuckLuciferWannamineRubyMinerOther55%Figure 29: Top cryptomining malware in EMEA2023Figure 30: Top cryptomining malware in APAC202363CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R4 CRYPTOMINERS GLOBAL ANALYSISIllegal cryptomining saw a decrease in 2023 due to Bitcoin rates not rebounding to their 2021 peakand the continued increase in mining difficulty. Only 9% of global corporate entities were affected bycryptominers in 2023, compared to 16% in 2022\. With the increase in GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)prices, some threat actors are now specifically targeting graphic designers and engineering platformsfor their enhanced GPU capabilities as miners. Monero remains profitable for mining, and its commonopen\-source mining tool, XMRig, was used in 65% of cryptomining attacks in 2023\. Cryptominersare integrating additional malicious functionalities, transforming some of them, like LemonDuck,into multifaceted threats that span beyond their core function of mining cryptocurrency. In someinstances, as with the StripedFly malware, cryptomining activities might just be a cover for morecomplex espionage operations.Cloud infrastructure continues to be a target for cryptomining exploitation. In October, researchersreported a years\-long operation that exploited poorly secured IAM keys to access cloud environmentsfor deploying Monero miners. Often, the same access that allows threat actors to install acryptominer is later used for additional exploitation and breaches. This makes the presence ofcryptominers a potential precursor to broader security issues.64CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024

PERSPECTIVE75CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R6This section is based on the experience and data from a wide array of CPIRT analyses and mitigationcases, not limited to Check Point product users. CPIRT typically steps in after the clear manifestationof malicious activity, such as files encrypted by ransomware, identified email compromises, or thedetection of unauthorized malware files or processes. Analysis of initial threat indicators, or triggers,offers a different perspective of the threat landscape.Our Incident Response Team was contacted following an EDR security alert in a customersenvironment. Mimikatz, a notorious credential\-stealing tool, was caught in the act and blockedby the EDR system. This unusual activity raised immediate concerns, indicating the presenceof an adversary and its attempt to unobtrusively navigate the network. The client, realizing thepotential gravity of the situation, reached out to CPIRT for assistance.UNDERSTANDING INCIDENT TRIGGERSWe define incident triggers as the first indication of a compromise that prompted the client to seekIR services. Ransomware stands out as the predominant factor, accounting for approximately 30% ofall Incident\-Triggers. Ransomware attacks are often highly visible and severely disruptive, requiringimmediate action.11%3%3%6%14%RansomwareSecurity AlertBehavioural AnomalySuspicious EmailDDoSCERT AlertFraudulent TransactionOther30%13%20%Figure 40: Breakdown of CPIRT cases by Incident trigger in 2023\.76CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024 
CHAPTE R6Twenty percent of CIPRT cases in 2023 were triggered by an alert from a security product in thecustomers environment. These are often alerts of the highest severity, while lower severity alerts donot usually require the same response. Interestingly, behavioral anomalies, which include any unusualactivity that the regular user observes and that deviate from established patterns, prompted 13% ofincident response (IR) engagements. This high percentage reflects their significance as a red flag forpotentially severe security issues. However, it is important to keep in mind that reports of behavioralanomalies are often less reliable and may result in False Positives.In the graph above, the suspicious email category refers to any suspect inbound or outbound emailactivity. Suspicious outbound emails are extremely concerning, as they often indicate an emailcompromise in the organization. If not detected in time, these incidents may lead to an unauthorizedmoney transfer, which is another common IR trigger that comprised 3% of our cases in 2023\.Incident triggers that are less frequent but still critical include CERT alerts, in which the initialindication of compromise is provided by the local CERT, and dark web monitoring, in which the initialalert comes from finding mentions on underground forums of a breach or offers to buy initial access.Despite their lower prevalence, these triggers often indicate sophisticated and severe threats thatcan have significant ramifications if not addressed promptly.As we delved deeper into the incident, the plot thickened. We detected signs of data exfiltration,coupled with the discovery of a RAT (Remote Access Tool) and encryption binaries on the ActiveDirectory server. These elements were prepared for a wide\-scale deployment across thenetworkthe unmistakable precursors of a ransomware attack, mere minutes from execution.TOP ATTACK TYPESTop Attack refers to the category of the attack, not the indicator that triggered the investigation.Analysis of the top attack types shows that ransomware is the most prevalent threat type, accountingfor 46% of IR cases. Business Email Compromise (BEC), at 19% of the cases, is detected throughindicators such as suspicious email activity or fraudulent money transfers.In 2023, attacks thataimed to steal specific user identities, such as BEC, browser hijacking, and accounttakeover were even more prevalent, with an increase of over 20% over the previous year. Contributingto this increase was the growing reliance on cloud infrastructure as well as the prominence of accessbrokers, who sell credentials and access to organizations.77CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024

This tacticunderscores a stealth approach by attackers, who are leveraging tools that evade traditional malwaredetection. These tools, originally intended for legitimate use, are increasingly used by threat actors,which makes it more complicated to distinguish between conventional and malicious activities onnetworks. In contrast, known malicious tools, such as Mimikatz and CobaltStrike were involved in26% and 16% of breaches, respectively.Further investigation into the incident revealed the use of AnyDesk as the remote command toolof choice by the attackers, providing them with persistent access to the compromised systems.Their initial access did not trigger security alerts, allowing the threat actor to hide in plain sight.78CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024 
CHAPTE R6RANSOMWARE: THE PRINCIPAL THREATSeveral families emerge as particularly prominent in the 2023 CPIRT ransomware threat landscape.Notably, the 'Royal' ransomware has rapidly evolved to become a potent threat, accounting for asignificant number of incidents. In most cases, phishing was used as the initial access vector, oftendeploying malicious PDFs or employing callback phishing tactics to install remote desktop access.In addition, Royal actors repurposed tools like Cobalt Strike, NSudo, and PsExec for the second stagesof the attacks.ALPHV (BlackCat) ransomware demonstrated its versatility as it was used to attack various systems,including Windows, Linux, and VMware instances. As ALPHV operates as a Ransomware\-as\-a\-Service(RaaS) model, deployed by distinct affiliates, we saw a variety of entry vectors and TTPs used before itsdeployment, making each incident unique and challenging to predict and defend against.Not all breaches are leveraged immediately.
The initial breach often begins when threat actors 
use mass scanners to exploit newly discovered 
vulnerabilities in devices across the internet. However, 
even after patching, webshells and other persistence 
mechanisms can remain intact. These footholds are 
often later sold by Initial Access Brokers (IABs) and may 
resurface months or years later in subsequent attacks.TI MO TI SHead of Global Detection

CHAPTE R6These vulnerabilities, particularly ProxyShell and Citrix RCE (CVE\-2023\-3519\), can enable threat actorsto install webshells on internet\-facing vulnerable devices. The devices targeted in those vulnerabilities,such as Exchange servers and NetScaler Gateways, are often internet\-facing, constituting primetargets. Once compromised, these devices continue to function as dormant footholds for the threatactor, even after patching.While diving deeper into the incident and trying to locate the initial infection vector, we identifiedCVE\-2023\-3519, a remote code execution vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler systems as the initialpoint of compromise. This vulnerability had been exploited to deploy a webshell on the device,which remained undetected even after the system was patched. This oversight allowed the threatactor to maintain network access. Three months post\-exploitation, this webshell was activatedby another threat actor who intended to deploy ransomware. Fortunately, due to the customer'salertness and CPIRT's prompt response, the ransomware attack was successfully thwartedbefore it could inflict damage.This reality creates a false sense of security for administrators who believe patched devices are secure,while actually, a threat actor's foothold might have been established much earlier. In our investigationsthis year, the longest period noted for a dormant threat was 22 months.Following the patching of vulnerabilities, security procedures must include security scans to removepossible backdoors, webshells and other persistence mechanisms. Organizations must also continueto monitor for any anomalies that may indicate covert threats within network infrastructure.80CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2024C HAPTE R70
