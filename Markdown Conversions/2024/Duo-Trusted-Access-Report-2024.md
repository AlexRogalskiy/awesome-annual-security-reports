All rights reserved.MethodologyIn this report, well delve into insights drawn from ananalysis of over 16 billion authentications in the lastyear (and over 44B in the last 4 years), spanning nearly52 million different browsers, on 58 million endpointsand 21 million unique phones across regions includingNorth America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East,and the Asia Pacific. We defined our 2023 annual timerange as between June 1, 2022, and May 31, 2023\.Key Findings01Stronger Auth Methods Show Upward Trends
Authenticator apps like Duo mobile appeal to both demand for higher security and ease\-of\-use,with 91\.5% of accounts enabling Duo Push as a factor accounting for 21% or over 3\.2 billionauthentications. We also observed a decreasing trend in SMS and phone calls as a factor,dipping to an all\-time\-low with 4\.9% of authenticationsa 22% decrease from 2022\.020304Return\-to\-Office is the New Hybrid Work Reality
Last year, access to remote access applications fell to nearly 25% of authentications afterpeaking in 2020\. The quantity of authentications in this category has continued to declinesince then as more companies move staff back into the office.MFA Usage Continues to Expand Globally
The number of MFA authentications using Duo rose by 41% in the past year, with countries likeGermany seeing a 52\.3% increase in authentications year over year. In the Asia\-Pacific region,Japan, the Philippines, and Australia saw continued growth from last year, increasing by 28%,24\.9%, and 16\.9% respectively. Brazil makes the third\-highest increase in authenticationsseeing26\.3% more MFA usage from 2022\.Diverse Device Environments Require Vendor\-Agnostic Security
While Windows continues to lead the pack comprising 38\.2% of access devices, we note thatiOS is a strong second at 33\.4% in the overall operating system ranking. Apple continues to rulethe roost in the mobile category amongst Duo users, with the nearest contender being Android,which has a far lower adoption rate at 28\.2%.Eliminating potential security gaps,vendor\-agnostic security also allows for greater flexibility and scalability as the securitysystem can easily adapt to changes in the device environment.5 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.Key Findings05Organizations are putting in stricter controls reducing risk of out\-of\-date software
The percentage of failures due to out\-of\-date devices increased by 74\.7% in 2023\.The more operating systems (OS) an organization allows to authenticate, the more likely it isthose authentications will occur with an out\-of\-date OS.Organizations particularly thosewhich are expanding their IT environments are increasingly putting in stricter controls, aimingto reduce risks posed by out\-of\-date software.060708Failed Authentications Highlight User Risks
5% of all measured authentications were ones that failed. When we further examined the data,we discovered that 28% of the failed authentications were due to the users not being enrolled inthe system. Unenrolled users may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or critical systems,leading to data breaches.Top 3 Policy Groups to Reduce Security Debt
One of the most effective strategies for mitigating security debt is through the comprehensivemanagement of risk. Policies addressing geo\-restrictions, unsecure devices, and granular per\-user or per\-application access can help reduce complexity and increase security coverage.However, 96\.4% of organizations have no policy related to location (allow, deny, or require 2FA).Identity is The New Perimeter 
Without proper visibility, threat detection, and response, identity infrastructure provides ampleopportunity for attackers to enter critical systems.In 23% of engagements observed by Talos 
IR, attackers were able to abuse compromised credentials to access valid accounts1\. The 
average company has 40\.26% of accounts with either no MFA or a weak MFA2\.In an environment where sophisticated cyberattacks have become the norm, an 
access management solution needs to be enhanced with identity threat detection
and response capabilities, offering visibility across an organizations identity 
ecosystem in a single, comprehensive interface.Footnotes:1\.From Talos IR 2023 Year In Review, see Telemetry Trends pg. 6\-72\.From the State of Identity Security report (Oort), see Section 2 Multi Factor Authentication: Full Coverage Remains Elusive6 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates.

All rights reserved.Stronger Auth Methods Show Upward TrendsThe weaknesses of passwords as a sole authentication method are well\-documented. They canbe guessed, cracked, phished, or stolen, and users often exacerbate these vulnerabilities byreusing passwords across multiple services or creating simple, easily decipherable passwords.In contrast, multi\-factor authentication (MFA) mitigates these risks by introducing additionalhurdles for potential attackers. Even if a password is compromised, the chances of an attackeralso having access to the users physical device or biometric information are significantly lower.However, recent high\-profile cyber\-attacks have shown that simply enabling a second factordoes not make an account impenetrable.

These apps areused for various purposes including troubleshooting, file transfers, remote administration, oraccessing files and software on an office computer from a remote location.Last year, the number of authentications for remote access applicationsreached nearly 25%. This is lower than pre\-pandemic levels after thepeak we saw in 2020\. The quantity of authentications in this categoryhas continued to decline since then as more companies move staff backinto the office. While we observe a lower volume of authentications acrossthe board during the December and January holiday periods, severalindustries including education, retail, and healthcare spiked during thefirst calendar quarter.10 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.Lets set the sceneWith the return of business travel, designated in\-office policy, or even just flu season,predictable ebb and flow of authentication requests begin to fluctuate. The cadence breaks asemployees take leave, work remotely, or operate on varied schedules. These changes can leadto a surge in remote access requests, with employees reaching out to corporate networks froma multitude of locations and devices, not just their usual work terminals. Consequently, the ITsystems must handle an influx of mixed on\-premises and off\-site login attempts with a greaterreliance on VPNs and other remote access technologies.Moreover, seasonality can also bring about an increase in temporary staff as businesses scaleup to meet demand. This influx requires the creation and management of additional temporarycredentials, a wave of new entries into the authentication system. Once the season wanes,theres a corresponding outflow as these seasonal credentials are revoked.This variance does not merely alter the volume, but also the nature of authentications. There isa heightened need for robust security measures as the risk of cyber threats often spikes duringthese times. Thus, a layered security approach becomes even more crucial with MFA as aminimum requirement.During these peak times, the IT environments authentication protocols must be both elasticand secure, expanding to accommodate the increased and varied load while maintaining theintegrity of the system. IT staff remain on high alert to watch for any anomalous activity thatcould signify a breach attempt.11 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.Futureproofing Against AttackersThe identity threat landscape is rapidly evolving, and trusted identity providers have fallenunder attack. According to CISA, attackers are actively exploiting identity policy gaps to gainaccess to critical applications. Regardless of the increased risk, 85% of organizations feelthey are not prepared and ready to protect themselves against modern attacks according to
the Cisco Secure Readiness Index study3\.Visibility across the identity infrastructure is a must\-have when addressing the types of attacksadversaries concoct. While theres been a significant uptick amongst MFA authenticationsthrough Duo, another piece of research suggests that security gaps are still across the market: 
the average company has 40% of accounts with either no MFA or weak MFA4\. Especially 
in periods of change, strong access management and identity visibility is critical. For briefmoments you might strike the right balance, only to be disrupted by new and emerging threats, 
changing user behavior, and a complex IT environment.This is why modern security initiatives require continuous monitoring across identity, criticalapplications, and human resources information system (HRIS) versus a set it and forget itapproach. As the security landscape evolves, many businesses are adopting a zero trustaccess policy strategy to mitigate modern attack surfaces. Organizations with a maturezero trust implementation score 30% higher in security resiliency than organizations without
a zero trust strategy5\.In 2023, we saw a proliferation of two specific types of MFA\-targeting attacks takingadvantage of push\-based authentications and unassuming users:0102Push harassmentMultiple successive push notifications to bother a user into accepting apush for a fraudulent login attempt.Push fatigueConstant MFA means users pay less attention to the details of their login,causing a user to mindlessly accept a push login request.Duo already supports WebAuthn FIDO2 authenticators, which offer the strongest protectionagainst MFA\-based attacks. However, we know that rolling passwordless out across anorganization is a journey. Its encouraging to see that Duo Verified Push, a more flexible step\-upfactor that became generally available to all Duo customers during the data period of this report,was enabled on over 5,600 accounts.12 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.As attackers techniques become more sophisticated, a multi\-layered defense system is crucial.Trust in users is essential, but no longer enough. The addition of outsidevendors and contractors adds complexity to closed, managed endpoint\-only 
access policy. Duo Trusted Endpoints, made available to all Duo editions, adds 
an extra layer of security even if an organization cannot manage the devicedirectly.Administrators can define a trust policy for every endpointwhethermanaged or unmanaged, company\-issued, contractor\-owned, or personaland stop attackers unknown devices even if they are able to bypass MFA.Increased friction often appears as a challenge to user adoption. As part of 
balancing security with productivity, we enhanced Duo Remembered Devices 
to account for changes in risk: when we recognize the device a user is on,we use a securely generated device token to authenticate so long as trustis maintained.While access security should be tailored to the level of risk,organizations can struggle to get buy\-in to add friction for every login.
Duos Risk\-Based Authentication solution addresses this challengeonly 
stepping up to the more secure method when environment risk signalsindicate there are potential threats, like location anomalies or known attack 
patterns. Whether security teams enable Verified Duo Push for all users, or 
through a risk\-based approach, this allows organizations to make accesssecurity decisions based on their risk appetite and organizations needs.IT teams must ensure that their Identity Security program is built on a strongfoundation with the right tools, like strong MFA factors and intelligent step\-up. 
Once these tools and policies are in place, Identity Threat Detection and 
Response (ITDR) can bolster an organizations identity security posture by 
arming the IT security professionals with both proactive and reactive tools.ITDR helps proactively detect policy misconfigurations, identity\-provider\-to\-HRIS discrepancies,and excessive privileges. It can also catch high\-risk scenarios such as dormant or inactiveaccounts and accounts with MFA disableda trend noted in the 2023 Cisco Talos Year in Review 
Report6\. On the reactive side, the tool equips IT teams to respond to suspicious activities such as 
new MFA device registration, risky SSO sessions, superman (unrealistic travel) logins, access froma new device or location and more.Footnotes:3\.See Cisco Cybersecurity Readiness Index, which categorizes companies into four stages of readiness: from Beginner, to Formative, Progressive,and finally Mature, based on their preparedness across five keypillars and the state of deployment of 19 security solutions within those4\.From the State of Identity Security report (Oort), see Section 2 Multi Factor Authentication: Full Coverage Remains Elusive5\.Read more findings from the Security Outcomes Report, Vol 3 published by Cisco (Renner)6\.Read all Cisco Talos Year in Review13 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates.

All rights reserved.An internationally dispersed workforce means more employees, contractors, clients, and thirdparties can access the organizations businesss digital infrastructure from various locations,often on different devices, networks, and operating systems which can introduce additionalvulnerabilities. Data and resources can be accessed from a greater scale of networks andendpoints. This helps support the concept that identity is the new perimeter and contextis the new MFA. Identity security is a forever evolving problem and its a daunting task fororganizations to plug every hole the user journey creates.In addition, an international presence does not only increase the variety in technology stack, butit can also add a wider array to the physical challenges of a more geographically diverse userbase. Also, IT systems must cater to mixed tech stacks and varying data protection and privacylaws. This pushes the complexity that IT teams need to deal with yet another notch.Globalization, like the organization size, increases the probability of a presence of more thanone identity provider. Moreover, large organizations may acquire other companies, each ofwhich may have its own existing identity provider. Instead of consolidating everything underone identity provider, which can be complex and disruptive, organizations sometimes choose tomaintain multiple identity providers.Managing identities increases in complexity with greater probabilities of supporting morethan one identity provider (IdP). Without proper security measures in place, this can lead topotential security gaps or vulnerabilities that can be exploited for identity\-based attacks likecompromised credentials.Global business practice requires broader, vendor\-agnostic access management
that helps organizations detect, respond to, and report attacks.16 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.Identity is The New PerimeterIdentity security is a key part of access management. Securing and verifying identities allows anidentity and access management (IAM) system to manage access to resources effectively andsecurely. Because of this, its important to spend a few moments highlighting identity\-securitytrends that have come to light when we were pulling together this report.There are a few reasons why gaps in identity security occur. For some companies, the promptcomes from cloud migration. As companies grow and move their operations to the cloud,they often need to introduce new IAM systems but do not completely deprecate older IAMsystems. For other companies it is migration from an on\-premises directory to a cloud\-baseddirectory but keeping both. And the third group is composed of companies that have acquiredone or more companies and support numerous identity platforms.Another contributing factor comes in the form of operational challenges. Identity securityoften falls under the IT function and may not receive the attention and resources itneeds to be effective. It requires investment in technology and personnel to manageand continuously monitor the IAM systems, ensure compliance with regulations, andrespond to security incidents.For some, cloud migrations and organizational scaling require the introduction of new IAMsystems. Mergers and acquisitions, operational globalization, and a geographically diverse userbase add even more complexity to keeping track of authenticating identities.In the face of digital transformation, identity security may suffer from a lack of resources orprioritization typically bucketed as an IT function rather than a security one. Without propervisibility and threat detection, identity infrastructure provides ample opportunity for attackersto gain entry to critical systems. Identity has traditionally been managed by an organizations ITteams. With identity being a top attack vector, its critical to bring together identity teams andthe Security Operations Center (SOC) with ITDR so everyone is on the same page.Without proper visibility and threat 
detection, identity infrastructure provides 
ample opportunity for attackers to gain 
entry to critical systems17The Talos PerspectiveCyber attackers are agile and often backed by substantial resources,including state sponsorship. This has led to an increase in advancedpersistent threats which can target identities to gain access tosensitive information.But this is nothing new. Attackers have targeted identities in their campaignsfor many years. For example, on\-premises identity directories or VPNs thatlack additional protections have fallen victim to several attacks. Managingan increased range of identities is also an indicator of expanded attacksurface. Talos Incident Response (Talos IR) has repeatedly seen attackerstargeting vendor and contractor accounts (VCAs), which typically haveexpanded privileges and access. VCAs are often overlooked duringaccount audits due to trust placed in the third party, making them an
easy target for attackers.The Talos 2023 Year in Review report saw compromised credentialson valid accounts making up 23% of initial access vectors, with use ofvalid accounts as the second\-most common MITRE ATT\&CK technique 
observed7\. While one major vulnerability is improperly implemented MFA 
or lack thereof, in some engagements attackers were able to bypass MFAthrough MFA fatigue or push bombing attacks. ITDR can help surface therisks associated with valid account attacks and help correlate informationfrom HRIS to identity providers and critical applications to help mitigatelow\-hanging fruit credential attacks.Identity sprawlOrganizations are struggling with identity sprawl, which occurs whenusers have numerous accounts and identities managed by multiple systemsthat are not synchronized. This presents a continuous security risk andoperational challenge for many security and IT teams.Identity sprawl is a growing challenge. Talos IR research noted that it waschallenging to identify how the credentials were compromised consideringthey were obtained from devices outside the companys visibility, such assaved credentials on an employees personal device. One report sharedthat on average, companies have 340\.5 personal accounts (Gmail, Yahoo,

All rights reserved.03Establishing Device TrustGaining visibility into and securing myriad devices is still an ongoing battle, especially fororganizations and industries that see a large diversity of endpoints such as higher education.Strong authentication mechanisms are at the heart of the security protocol an essentialline of defense in confirming the identities of users accessing the network. However, robustauthentication is just one piece of the cybersecurity puzzle.Ensuring users are using trusted devices and networks to access corporate data addsanother layer of complexity. IT environments with complex supply chain operations, third\-party partnerships, and contractor devices introduce risk of outside, unmanaged devices andunknown endpoints. This variability makes it challenging, if not impossible, to guarantee visibilityand trust without a dedicated layer of security. Even with strong end\-user authentication, theuncertainty of unmanaged network and device security remains a vulnerable chink in the armor.In this context, identity\-centric security is a dynamic and multifaceted endeavor. It demandsa strategy that is comprehensive and adaptive, integrating advanced authentication, networksecurity solutions, endpoint protection, continuous monitoring, and an informed andconscientious workforce.A Diverse Device EnvironmentThe starting point for establishing device trust is gaining a comprehensiveunderstanding of the devices themselves their operating systems, thebrowsers they use, their patch levels, and their compliance with corporatesecurity policies. This understanding is critical because the securityposture of any device is heavily influenced by the currency and integrityof its OS and browser. Outdated software can be riddled with unpatchedvulnerabilities that are ripe for exploitation, turning an unassuming deviceinto a Trojan horse within the network.To determine if a device can be considered trustworthy, IT and
security teams must be able to answer several key questions:Are there any unauthorized applications or software present?Is the device encrypted, and are its security settingsconfigured according to the enterprises standards?What OS is the device running?Is this OS still supported and receiving security updates?What browser versions are installed, and are they setto update automatically?19 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates.

Should a device fall short say, running anOS version thats no longer supported it can be flagged for review, blocked from accessingsensitive resources, or provided with limited, controlled access to mitigate potential risks.This is important as applications and browsers like Google Chrome up the frequency of patches,accounting for performance and security bug fixes on a weekly basis. But how often arepeople relaunching and updating their applications? Of the 16 billion authentications measured,62% of non\-mobile authentications are attributed to the Chrome browser. The ability to seeaccess device patch levels and prompt users to self\-remediate out\-of\-date devices growseven more critical.Visibility can be achieved through various tools and practices. Endpoint management systems,for instance, offer dashboards that provide real\-time insights into the status of every device 
connected to the network. Automated inventory tools can keep track of the devices in use,their software versions, and their patch history. This monitoring is essential not just for ongoingmanagement but also for responding to potential security incidents with speed and precision.23 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates.

In the ever\-evolving geographyof digital threats, authenticating within an IT environment that relies on outdated softwareis akin to navigating a ship with an old map.Outdated software often contains unpatched vulnerabilities, which are like hidden,open backdoors for cyber attackers. These vulnerabilities are well\-documented andeasily exploitable as they stay in the public domain, providing a treasure map for maliciousentities to gain unauthorized access. In this scenario, each authentication event is a gamble,increasing the chances that a security flaw can be used to compromise credentials.Moreover, software that is past its support life no longer receives updates from its developers.This means that even as new threats emerge, the authentication mechanisms stay static andbecome increasingly ineffective against the sophisticated techniques employed by modern 
cyber adversaries. It is a static defense against a dynamic offense.24 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.Proportion of successful authentications with out of date Operating SystemCount of accounts10k1k100101All1 in

A higher number means a wider variety of OSesthat share an equal proportion of authentications. On the vertical axis is the proportion ofauthentications made with out\-of\-date OSes. The line across the bottom shows organizationsthat enforce OSes to be up to date, and the vertical line on the left shows organizations that useonly a single OS.Based on the data in Figure 11, the correlation shows that the more operating systems anorganization allows to authenticate, the more likely it is those authentications will occur withan out\-of\-date OS. This becomes a fast reality for those expanding IT environmentsTo rely on outdated authentication software is to walk on a tightrope without a safety net. Its anopen invitation to security breaches, data theft, and the many consequences that follow. For anIT environment to remain secure and effective, it is imperative to invest in current, robust devicetrust methods that evolve in lockstep with the landscape of digital threats, providing visibilityand enabling remediation. This is not just best practice; it is a fundamental tenet of responsible 
IT management in the digital age.25 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.69%Increase encryption 
usageOn Encryption \& FirewallWith the hybrid work model, organizations must also consider the use of virtual private
networks (VPN), application of strict firewall policies, enforcement of data encryption, andsecure setup of home networks. We looked at Duo Endpoint Health, particularly seeking tofind out if organizations were generally increasing or decreasing their use of various protections.On an organization\-by\-organization basis, we see that, on average, organizations increased thepercentage of encryption usage by 69%.Device hygiene for the enterprise is an ongoing, evolving requirement, not a set\-it\-and\-forget\-itpolicy. This responsibility extends to the end\-of\-life process for devices, ensuring that all datais securely wiped and that devices are disposed of in a manner that does not pose a securitythreat. Similarly, user access levels must be adjusted to mitigate unnecessary or excessiveprivileges. Regular audits and compliance checks ensure that device and identity hygienepractices are not just in place but are effectively enforced and updated.By diligently managing and monitoring operating system and browsers, among other deviceattributes, organizations can enforce a strong security posture and ensure that trust is notblindly given, but is based on verifiable, compliant device behavior.26 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.Powerful Policy Controls04In a previous section, we highlighted the critical challenge of security debt an accumulation ofunaddressed risks and vulnerabilities that an organization must manage. Security debt can arisefrom various sources such as outdated software, legacy systems, technical shortcuts, and thedelayed application of security patches. Reducing this debt is essential for maintaining a robustsecurity posture and minimizing the organizations exposure to potential breaches.One of the most effective strategies for mitigating security debt is through the comprehensivemanagement of risk. This includes identifying, assessing, and prioritizing the vulnerabilitieswithin an organizations IT infrastructure. By understanding where the greatest risks lie, anorganization can allocate resources and efforts more effectively to address the most pressingsecurity concerns first, thereby reducing the overall security debt.Learning From When Authentications FailWhen reviewing the policy data, we uncovered some notable findings.In a move towards stronger methods of authentication, Duo Push\-based69\.2%authentication was present in 99\.3% of all global policies.

It was noted that 5% of all measured authentications were ones thatfailed. When we further examined the data, we discovered that 28% of thefailed authentications were due to the users not being enrolled in the system.move towards strongermethods of authenticationPercent of authentications failingDeny unenrolled userUser not in

All rights reserved.Benefits of Strong Device\-Based PoliciesA cornerstone of this risk reduction strategy is the implementation of uniform security policiesacross all assets in the environment. Device\-based policies are especially critical because theyprovide a consistent security framework that applies to every device within the organization,irrespective of its location or user. These policies can control various aspects of device security,including the enforcement of strong authentication measures, the application of regular patchesand updates, the configuration of firewalls and antivirus software, and the management ofuser privileges.Uniform device\-based policies are beneficial for several reasons:Consistency: They ensure that every device adheres to 
the same security standards, which helps to cut weaklinks in the security chain that attackers might exploit.Scalability: As the organization grows, new devices 
can be brought into the fold with established policiesautomatically applied, making it easier to managesecurity at scale.Compliance: Device\-based policies help organizations 
meet regulatory requirements by ensuring that alldevices are compliant with industry standards and laws,reducing the risk of fines and other penalties.Automation: These policies can often be enforced 
automatically, reducing the need for manual interventionand the associated human error.Visibility and Control: Implementing uniform policies 
aids in the monitoring and control of device security,as deviations from the policy are easier to detectand remediate29 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.Top 3 Policy Groups to Reduce Security DebtWhile reducing security debt is a complex, multifaceted endeavor, the foundation of this effortlies in the consistent application of comprehensive device\-based policies. Such an approachaddresses the security debt at its root, reducing risk and fostering a more secure, resilientorganizational environment.The interplay between access devices and security policies is a critical facet of anorganizations cybersecurity framework. Rigorous security policies are set in place to ensurethat devices attempting to access corporate resources meet certain standards of securitybefore they are granted entry into the network. When a device does not meet these prescribedcriteria, it triggers a series of automated responses aimed at safeguarding the organizationsdigital assets.Duos data shows that organizations that implement device\-based policies most commonlyblock access from locations they consider unsecure and from where access should notoriginate. Organizations also tend to set policies to block invalid and out\-of\-date devices andthose that dont feature a screen lock or disk encryption, as those simple security steps canprotect the device and the data it transmits from being viewed by others.Here are 3 types of policies that can help reduce complexity and
increase security coverage:01Firstly, geo\-restrictions are a common security measure, especially in 
scenarios involving sensitive data regulated by legal or corporate policiesdictating data residency and sovereignty. When a user attempts to accessthe system from a location that is not whitelisted, the security protocolpromptly intervenes, resulting in a failed authentication. This geographicalgating is an effective deterrent against a range of threats, includingunauthorized access by international cybercriminals.Based off our research, many organizations do not take the necessarystep to implement geography\-based policies. In fact, we reported last yearthat the percentage of organizations who have any kind of policy denyingspecific geographic locations has dropped 20% since 2020\. In 2023,96\.4%96\.4% of organizations have no policy related to location (allow, deny,of organizations have noor require 2FA). However, among those enterprises that do deny geographicpolicy related to locationlocations, they block either Russia or China 91% of the time and 63% ofthose organizations block both countries.30 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates.

Devices that are no longer supported or have not been updated with thelatest security patches are often riddled with vulnerabilities that can beexploited by cyber attackers. Security policies are designed to detect suchdevices based on their security posture which includes the operatingsystem version, installed security patches, and other critical securityconfigurations. If a device is found wanting in any of these areas, the usermay be barred from logging in or prompted to update their device to complywith the current security standards.31 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates.

All rights reserved.03Third, granular access policies at the per\-user group or per\-application 
level lay the groundwork for least privileged access. Organizations today 
rely on their third\-party ecosystems to supplement and support criticalbusiness functions. Aside from regulatory requirements, having unknownguest, dormant, or orphaned accounts can create additional managementoverhead and be a vector for unauthorized access to sensitive resources.Organizations should implement policies and procedures for managingaccounts and limiting what they can access. This can include enforcingstrong multi\-factor authentication, regularly reviewing and auditing guestaccounts, and disabling those that are no longer needed.According to the State of Identity Security Report 2023, the averageorganization has many inactive accounts \- more than 24% of its totalidentities. These accounts experience more than 500 attacks everymonth. To add to user base complexity, more than 3\.24% of allidentities are guest accounts.The average organization 
sees over 500 attacks on 
inactive accounts each yearTo ensure these policies are effective, organizations must also invest in employee educationand awareness. After all, the most sophisticated policies can be undermined by human error.Organizations should educate their users about the potential risks associated with guestaccounts and the importance of granting access only to trusted external users. Regulartraining sessions, simulations, and security drills can ingrain best practices and create avigilant workforce capable of identifying and responding to security threats proactively.Such stringent access controls, while occasionally inconvenient for users, are a necessary 
defense in an era where the sophistication of cyberattacks continues to escalate. Theyensure that only compliant devices and by extension, their users can interact with theorganizations systems, thus preserving the integrity, confidentiality, and availabilityof corporate data and services.33 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.\+Closing WordsThe future of identity securityIdentity sprawl foments vulnerabilities. However, traditional identity infrastructure was builtwith IT operations in mind instead of security. Although the worlds of identity and security arecoming together, in many larger organizations, security teams continue to work independentlyof IAM teams. Talent shortage makes securing the organization even more challenging.For small and mid\-sized organizations, the IT department may just be a handful of peoplewearing lots of hats. A security team may not even exist yet. New security technologiessuch as identity threat detection and response can help bridge the gap between identityand security teams.In addition to operational challenges, organizations battle with human capital constraints,namely the reliance on people to manage identities. Identity security is complex and requiresan oversight of multiple elements, including:User identity, which represents a specific user and 
is typically associated with unique credentials forauthentication.Device identity, which can be uniquely identified
and associated with a user. The status andtrustworthiness of a device can affect a usersability to access certain resources.Attributes or properties of an identity, such as a users 
role, location, department, etc. Attributes can be used todetermine and enforce access policies.Permissions and access rights given to an identity, 
determining what resources that identity can accessand what actions they can perform.34 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.When IAM hygiene is poor, organizations identity attack surfaces increase and provideadditional opportunities to attackers. As more relationships are created between devices,attributes, identities and permissions, it becomes increasingly difficult to see and keep trackof which identities are doing what.Investigating incidents is also challenging without a solution that brings identity\-related datatogether from multiple sources or helps pass contextualized posture information from ITto SOC. Visibility into misconfigured and unused accounts, including employees, contractors,and service accounts is also vital.Having identity threat detection and response capabilities under one roof with accessmanagement is becoming a necessity.In tandem, these capabilities can help minimizechances of successful identity\-based attacks while offering holistic coverage acrossidentities and applications.To address identity\-based attacks with greater efficacy, IAM analytics need to be an inherentpart of such a solution. This way, IT administrators can quickly address any security gaps bymigrating from weak authentication to strong, phishing\-resistant, multi\-factor passwordlessdeployments across a customers entire enterprise stack.Context is the new MFAIn a world where data is king, but context is key, strong access management does notjust continue to strengthen corporate security it reshapes it. It addresses the inherentweaknesses of password\-dependent systems and establishes a more robust, dynamic defenseagainst the ever\-evolving threat landscape.Detailed logging and alerting mechanisms are essential to make sense of the noise. An attemptto authenticate via MFA can trigger alerts if the second or third factor fails, offering real\-timethreat detection and allowing for immediate response. This can greatly reduce the dwell time,the interval between a breach and its detection, which is crucial in mitigating the damageinflicted by a security incident.We know that when navigating uncharted complexities, the steps we need to take can beeasy to understand but hard to implement. As cyber threats grow in complexity and subtlety,adopting IAM best practices stands as a necessary evolution of security protocolsintegralto safeguarding the assets, reputation, and future of any modern organization.35 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.RecommendationsOrganization\-wide adoption of strong MFA and moving towards requiring only
phishing\-resistant MFA such as FIDO2 security keys for privileged accounts.Enable Verified Duo Push which disarms push harassment and push fatigue attacks andputs your organization on the path towards passwordless.Ensure only trusted devices, managed or unmanaged, are granted access tocorporate resources.Set data\-informed user authentication policies that consider your organizations risk levels 
and focus points, with intelligent factor step\-up that doesnt impede user productivity.Leverage a modern single sign\-on solution as a policy enforcement tool to apply
principles of zero trust and least privilege access for each application.Take advantage of solutions that assess user and device telemetry to identify known
threat patterns and anomalies, like Duo Risk\-Based Authentication. Evaluate login
attempts for context and risk.Identify the IAM complexities in your environment with ITDR and assess weak
points based on how much visibility you have. Leverage Identity Threat Detection 
and Response capabilities to get visibility across your identity ecosystem in a single, 
comprehensive interface.36 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates.
