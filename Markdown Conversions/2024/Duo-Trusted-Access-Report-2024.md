The New Frontier of Access 
Management and Identity Security
In exploring the future, were often drawn to predicting 
the unknown. Our quest for answers is unending, and 
we rely heavily on data to guide our predictions. 
Organizations today navigate a treacherous digital 
landscape where the motives of attackers are as 
varied as their methods ranging from financial gains, 
cyber espionage, and disruption to reputation damage 
to cyber warfare. Concurrently, these organizations 
also manage various internal complexities, from the 
intricacies of their IT stacks to dispersed hybrid 
workforces and a great variety of devices accessing 
their systems and applications. This evolution from ad 
hoc remote work setups to hybrid work models has 
extended the traditional enterprise perimeter to the far 
corners of the cyber realm.
Years ago, protecting an IT infrastructure might have 
been largely about ensuring that systems were running 
smoothly the proverbial keeping the lights on. Now, 
the remit has expanded exponentially; it encompasses 
a vigilant defense against a host of external cyber 
threats, from ransomware to state\-sponsored hacking. 
As the threat landscape has widened, so has the 
surface area for attacks, with every employees access 
or device becoming a potential entry point. This shift 
has transformed IT departments from units concerned 
primarily with operational uptime to essential guardians 
against a spectrum of sophisticated external threats.
While we cant tell precisely what the future will bring, 
analyzing historical patterns provides insights into 
future possibilities. For instance, the previous edition 
of the Trusted Access Report pointed out the soaring 
adoption of multi\-factor authentication (MFA) as 
companies have been looking to reduce risk in a more 
advanced security landscape.
As organizations grapple with increasingly sophisticated 
cybersecurity threats, a demand for holistic access 
management solutions has been apparent for a 
few years. MFA is a great security measure, but not 
enough on its own.More sophisticated threats call for 
additional layers of security. 
By integrating context, an access management solution 
can analyze the situation in which access is being 
requested, such as information about the users typical 
behavior or environment including their usual login 
times, geolocation and device.This adds an additional 
layer of security, providing a more holistic and dynamic 
approach to authentication. 
In essence, adding context to the authentication 
process allows systems to better differentiate between 
legitimate users and potential threats, enhancing 
security while maintaining a good user experience. 
Thus, context becomes the new form of MFA.
Introduction
MFA is a great security measure, but not 
enough on its own.More sophisticated 
threats call for additional layers of security.

Contextual factors such as location or device details 
(operating systems, for example) have been included
in Trusted Access Reports for years. However, with 
hybrid work as a firmly ingrained reality, the importance 
of contextual factors carries even more weight.
Another area where we have detected a rising level of 
interest is the future of identity; more specifically ways 
of addressing proliferation of digital identities from the 
cybersecurity perspective.
In the modern workplace, every employee may have 
multiple digital identities across various systems, 
applications, and platforms. This can range from email 
accounts, to access credentials for internal systems,
to profiles on collaboration platforms like Slack.
As businesses continue to adopt cloud services, 
software\-as\-a\-service platforms, and remote 
collaboration tools, the number of these digital
 identities grows. This proliferation has significant 
implications for both productivity and security.
On one hand, these identities can enable more 
seamless collaboration and access to necessary 
resources, improving efficiency. On the other hand, 
managing these numerous identities and ensuring
they are properly secured becomes a complex task.
Risk visibility across an organizations identity 
ecosystem in a single, comprehensive interface
has become a must.
This can be achieved via identity threat detection and 
response (ITDR) capabilities.The evolution of ITDR is 
integral to the future of identity, ensuring that our digital 
identities remain secure as they become increasingly 
prevalent in our day\-to\-day lives.
The challenge is clear: as the MFA usage continues to 
expand globally, so do attackers methods. To minimize 
chances of a breach, traditional MFA does not only 
need to be enhanced with contextual factors such as 
the users typical behavior or environment but also the 
visibility across an organizations identity ecosystem
in a single, comprehensive interface.

Key Findings
Stronger Auth Methods Show Upward Trends
Authenticator apps like Duo mobile appeal to both demand for higher security and ease\-of\-use, 
with 91\.5% of accounts enabling Duo Push as a factor accounting for 21% or over 3\.2 billion 
authentications. We also observed a decreasing trend in SMS and phone calls as a factor, 
dipping to an all\-time\-low with 4\.9% of authenticationsa 22% decrease from 2022\.
Return\-to\-Office is the New Hybrid Work Reality
Last year, access to remote access applications fell to nearly 25% of authentications after 
peaking in 2020\. The quantity of authentications in this category has continued to decline
since then as more companies move staff back into the office.
MFA Usage Continues to Expand Globally
The number of MFA authentications using Duo rose by 41% in the past year, with countries like 
Germany seeing a 52\.3% increase in authentications year over year. In the Asia\-Pacific region, 
Japan, the Philippines, and Australia saw continued growth from last year, increasing by 28%, 
24\.9%, and 16\.9% respectively. Brazil makes the third\-highest increase in authentications
seeing26\.3% more MFA usage from 2022\.
Diverse Device Environments Require Vendor\-Agnostic Security
While Windows continues to lead the pack comprising 38\.2% of access devices, we note that 
iOS is a strong second at 33\.4% in the overall operating system ranking. Apple continues to rule 
the roost in the mobile category amongst Duo users, with the nearest contender being Android, 
which has a far lower adoption rate at 28\.2%.Eliminating potential security gaps,
vendor\-agnostic security also allows for greater flexibility and scalability as the security
system can easily adapt to changes in the device environment.
Methodology
In this report, well delve into insights drawn from an 
analysis of over 16 billion authentications in the last
year (and over 44B in the last 4 years), spanning nearly 
52 million different browsers, on 58 million endpoints
and 21 million unique phones across regions including 
North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, 
and the Asia Pacific. We defined our 2023 annual time
range as between June 1, 2022, and May 31, 2023\.

Key Findings
Organizations are putting in stricter controls reducing risk of out\-of\-date software
The percentage of failures due to out\-of\-date devices increased by 74\.7% in 2023\.
The more operating systems (OS) an organization allows to authenticate, the more likely it is 
those authentications will occur with an out\-of\-date OS.Organizations particularly those 
which are expanding their IT environments are increasingly putting in stricter controls, aiming 
to reduce risks posed by out\-of\-date software.
Failed Authentications Highlight User Risks
5% of all measured authentications were ones that failed. When we further examined the data, 
we discovered that 28% of the failed authentications were due to the users not being enrolled in 
the system. Unenrolled users may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or critical systems, 
leading to data breaches.
Top 3 Policy Groups to Reduce Security Debt
One of the most effective strategies for mitigating security debt is through the comprehensive 
management of risk. Policies addressing geo\-restrictions, unsecure devices, and granular per\-
user or per\-application access can help reduce complexity and increase security coverage. 
However, 96\.4% of organizations have no policy related to location (allow, deny, or require 2FA).
Identity is The New Perimeter 
Without proper visibility, threat detection, and response, identity infrastructure provides ample 
opportunity for attackers to enter critical systems.In 23% of engagements observed by Talos 
IR, attackers were able to abuse compromised credentials to access valid accounts1\. The 
average company has 40\.26% of accounts with either no MFA or a weak MFA2\.
In an environment where sophisticated cyberattacks have become the norm, an 
access management solution needs to be enhanced with identity threat detection
and response capabilities, offering visibility across an organizations identity 
ecosystem in a single, comprehensive interface.

Stronger Auth Methods Show Upward Trends
The weaknesses of passwords as a sole authentication method are well\-documented. They can 
be guessed, cracked, phished, or stolen, and users often exacerbate these vulnerabilities by 
reusing passwords across multiple services or creating simple, easily decipherable passwords. 
In contrast, multi\-factor authentication (MFA) mitigates these risks by introducing additional 
hurdles for potential attackers. Even if a password is compromised, the chances of an attacker 
also having access to the users physical device or biometric information are significantly lower.
However, recent high\-profile cyber\-attacks have shown that simply enabling a second factor 
does not make an account impenetrable. Not all authenticators are born equal, with factors like 
FIDO2 security keys and WebAuthn\-enabled biometrics proving harder to exploit compared to 
weaker, but more accessible, factors like SMS text or phone call.

4\.9% of authentications a 22% decrease from 2022\. More secure methods like WebAuthn 
and hard tokens take their place as the benefits of phishing\-resistant MFA and smarter access 
policies gain traction amongst SMB and enterprises alike.

Return\-to\-Office is the New Hybrid Work Reality 
Figure 05 Authentications for Remote Access Applications
Remote access applications are software apps that allow a user to remotely access and control 
another computer or network over the internet or a local network connection. These apps are 
used for various purposes including troubleshooting, file transfers, remote administration, or 
accessing files and software on an office computer from a remote location.
Last year, the number of authentications for remote access applications 
reached nearly 25%. This is lower than pre\-pandemic levels after the
peak we saw in 2020\. The quantity of authentications in this category
has continued to decline since then as more companies move staff back 
into the office. While we observe a lower volume of authentications across 
the board during the December and January holiday periods, several 
industries including education, retail, and healthcare spiked during the
first calendar quarter.

Lets set the scene
With the return of business travel, designated in\-office policy, or even just flu season, 
predictable ebb and flow of authentication requests begin to fluctuate. The cadence breaks as 
employees take leave, work remotely, or operate on varied schedules. These changes can lead 
to a surge in remote access requests, with employees reaching out to corporate networks from 
a multitude of locations and devices, not just their usual work terminals. Consequently, the IT 
systems must handle an influx of mixed on\-premises and off\-site login attempts with a greater 
reliance on VPNs and other remote access technologies.
Moreover, seasonality can also bring about an increase in temporary staff as businesses scale 
up to meet demand. This influx requires the creation and management of additional temporary 
credentials, a wave of new entries into the authentication system. Once the season wanes, 
theres a corresponding outflow as these seasonal credentials are revoked.
This variance does not merely alter the volume, but also the nature of authentications. There is 
a heightened need for robust security measures as the risk of cyber threats often spikes during 
these times. Thus, a layered security approach becomes even more crucial with MFA as a 
minimum requirement.
During these peak times, the IT environments authentication protocols must be both elastic 
and secure, expanding to accommodate the increased and varied load while maintaining the 
integrity of the system. IT staff remain on high alert to watch for any anomalous activity that 
could signify a breach attempt.

The identity threat landscape is rapidly evolving, and trusted identity providers have fallen
under attack. According to CISA, attackers are actively exploiting identity policy gaps to gain 
access to critical applications. Regardless of the increased risk, 85% of organizations feel
they are not prepared and ready to protect themselves against modern attacks according to
the Cisco Secure Readiness Index study3\.
Visibility across the identity infrastructure is a must\-have when addressing the types of attacks 
adversaries concoct. While theres been a significant uptick amongst MFA authentications 
through Duo, another piece of research suggests that security gaps are still across the market: 
the average company has 40% of accounts with either no MFA or weak MFA4\. Especially 
in periods of change, strong access management and identity visibility is critical. For brief 
moments you might strike the right balance, only to be disrupted by new and emerging threats, 
changing user behavior, and a complex IT environment.
This is why modern security initiatives require continuous monitoring across identity, critical 
applications, and human resources information system (HRIS) versus a set it and forget it 
approach. As the security landscape evolves, many businesses are adopting a zero trust
access policy strategy to mitigate modern attack surfaces. Organizations with a mature
zero trust implementation score 30% higher in security resiliency than organizations without
a zero trust strategy5\.
Futureproofing Against Attackers 
01
02
In 2023, we saw a proliferation of two specific types of MFA\-targeting attacks taking 
advantage of push\-based authentications and unassuming users:
Push harassment 
Multiple successive push notifications to bother a user into accepting a 
push for a fraudulent login attempt.
Push fatigue 
Constant MFA means users pay less attention to the details of their login, 
causing a user to mindlessly accept a push login request. 
Duo already supports WebAuthn FIDO2 authenticators, which offer the strongest protection 
against MFA\-based attacks. However, we know that rolling passwordless out across an 
organization is a journey. Its encouraging to see that Duo Verified Push, a more flexible step\-up 
factor that became generally available to all Duo customers during the data period of this report, 
was enabled on over 5,600 accounts.

As attackers techniques become more sophisticated, a multi\-layered defense system is crucial.

Trust in users is essential, but no longer enough. The addition of outside 
vendors and contractors adds complexity to closed, managed endpoint\-only 
access policy. Duo Trusted Endpoints, made available to all Duo editions, adds 
an extra layer of security even if an organization cannot manage the device 
directly.Administrators can define a trust policy for every endpointwhether 
managed or unmanaged, company\-issued, contractor\-owned, or personal
and stop attackers unknown devices even if they are able to bypass MFA.
Increased friction often appears as a challenge to user adoption. As part of 
balancing security with productivity, we enhanced Duo Remembered Devices 
to account for changes in risk: when we recognize the device a user is on,
we use a securely generated device token to authenticate so long as trust
is maintained. 
While access security should be tailored to the level of risk,
organizations can struggle to get buy\-in to add friction for every login.
Duos Risk\-Based Authentication solution addresses this challengeonly 
stepping up to the more secure method when environment risk signals
indicate there are potential threats, like location anomalies or known attack 
patterns. Whether security teams enable Verified Duo Push for all users, or 
through a risk\-based approach, this allows organizations to make access 
security decisions based on their risk appetite and organizations needs.
IT teams must ensure that their Identity Security program is built on a strong 
foundation with the right tools, like strong MFA factors and intelligent step\-up. 
Once these tools and policies are in place, Identity Threat Detection and 
Response (ITDR) can bolster an organizations identity security posture by 
arming the IT security professionals with both proactive and reactive tools.
ITDR helps proactively detect policy misconfigurations, identity\-provider\-to\-HRIS discrepancies, 
and excessive privileges. It can also catch high\-risk scenarios such as dormant or inactive 
accounts and accounts with MFA disableda trend noted in the 2023 Cisco Talos Year in Review 
Report6\. On the reactive side, the tool equips IT teams to respond to suspicious activities such as 
new MFA device registration, risky SSO sessions, superman (unrealistic travel) logins, access from 
a new device or location and more.

Attack Surface Increase
The Continuing Rise in Global MFA Usage 
Data shows that the global customer base protected by Duos
multi\-factor authentication security is continuing to grow. The number
of MFA authentications using Duo rose by 41% in the past year, with 
countries like Germany seeing a 52\.3% increase in authentications year 
over year. In the Asia\-Pacific region, Japan, the Philippines, and Australia 
saw continued growth from last year, increasing by 28%, 24\.9%, and 16\.9% 
respectively. For the first year measured, Brazil makes the third highest 
increase in authentications seeing 26\.3% more MFA usage from 2022\.
This indicates a rising trend in the recognition of the importance of 
enhanced security measures predominantly as a response to a rising 
volume of cyber threats, but also as a reflection of international
compliance requirements such as GDPR, C5, AgID, or HIPAA.

In figure 7 we revisit a statistic we looked at last year, which is the geographic diversity
from which an organization operates. In particular, we look at the average number of countries 
that we see users authenticate from when an organization is found in, say, Hong Kong.
With continued diversification and spread of business interests, Hong Kong saw the highest 
average spread of authentication across 5\.6 different countries on average. Organizations
in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom saw authentications come in from
an average of 4 different countries a 72% jump from the 1\.5 to 1\.75 different countries
on average seen last year.

An internationally dispersed workforce means more employees, contractors, clients, and third 
parties can access the organizations businesss digital infrastructure from various locations, 
often on different devices, networks, and operating systems which can introduce additional 
vulnerabilities. Data and resources can be accessed from a greater scale of networks and 
endpoints. This helps support the concept that identity is the new perimeter and context 
is the new MFA. Identity security is a forever evolving problem and its a daunting task for 
organizations to plug every hole the user journey creates.
In addition, an international presence does not only increase the variety in technology stack, but 
it can also add a wider array to the physical challenges of a more geographically diverse user 
base. Also, IT systems must cater to mixed tech stacks and varying data protection and privacy 
laws. This pushes the complexity that IT teams need to deal with yet another notch.
Globalization, like the organization size, increases the probability of a presence of more than 
one identity provider. Moreover, large organizations may acquire other companies, each of 
which may have its own existing identity provider. Instead of consolidating everything under 
one identity provider, which can be complex and disruptive, organizations sometimes choose to 
maintain multiple identity providers.
Managing identities increases in complexity with greater probabilities of supporting more 
than one identity provider (IdP). Without proper security measures in place, this can lead to 
potential security gaps or vulnerabilities that can be exploited for identity\-based attacks like 
compromised credentials. 
Global business practice requires broader, vendor\-agnostic access management
that helps organizations detect, respond to, and report attacks.
17
Identity is The New Perimeter 
Identity security is a key part of access management. Securing and verifying identities allows an 
identity and access management (IAM) system to manage access to resources effectively and 
securely.Because of this, its important to spend a few moments highlighting identity\-security 
trends that have come to light when we were pulling together this report.
There are a few reasons why gaps in identity security occur.For some companies, the prompt 
comes from cloud migration. As companies grow and move their operations to the cloud, 
they often need to introduce new IAM systems but do not completely deprecate older IAM 
systems.For other companies it is migration from an on\-premises directory to a cloud\-based 
directory but keeping both. And the third group is composed of companies that have acquired 
one or more companies and support numerous identity platforms.
Another contributing factor comes in the form of operational challenges. Identity security
often falls under the IT function and may not receive the attention and resources it
needs to be effective. It requires investment in technology and personnel to manage
and continuously monitor the IAM systems, ensure compliance with regulations, and
respond to security incidents.
For some, cloud migrations and organizational scaling require the introduction of new IAM 
systems. Mergers and acquisitions, operational globalization, and a geographically diverse user 
base add even more complexity to keeping track of authenticating identities.
In the face of digital transformation, identity security may suffer from a lack of resources or 
prioritization typically bucketed as an IT function rather than a security one. Without proper 
visibility and threat detection, identity infrastructure provides ample opportunity for attackers 
to gain entry to critical systems.Identity has traditionally been managed by an organizations IT 
teams. With identity being a top attack vector, its critical to bring together identity teams and 
the Security Operations Center (SOC) with ITDR so everyone is on the same page.

detection, identity infrastructure provides

The Talos Perspective 
Cyber attackers are agile and often backed by substantial resources, 
including state sponsorship. This has led to an increase in advanced 
persistent threats which can target identities to gain access to
sensitive information.
But this is nothing new. Attackers have targeted identities in their campaigns 
for many years. For example, on\-premises identity directories or VPNs that 
lack additional protections have fallen victim to several attacks. Managing 
an increased range of identities is also an indicator of expanded attack 
surface. Talos Incident Response (Talos IR) has repeatedly seen attackers 
targeting vendor and contractor accounts (VCAs), which typically have 
expanded privileges and access. VCAs are often overlooked during
account audits due to trust placed in the third party, making them an
easy target for attackers.
The Talos 2023 Year in Review report saw compromised credentials 
on valid accounts making up 23% of initial access vectors, with use of 
valid accounts as the second\-most common MITRE ATT\&CK technique 
observed7\. While one major vulnerability is improperly implemented MFA 
or lack thereof, in some engagements attackers were able to bypass MFA 
through MFA fatigue or push bombing attacks. ITDR can help surface the 
risks associated with valid account attacks and help correlate information 
from HRIS to identity providers and critical applications to help mitigate
low\-hanging fruit credential attacks.
Identity sprawl
Organizations are struggling with identity sprawl, which occurs when 
users have numerous accounts and identities managed by multiple systems 
that are not synchronized. This presents a continuous security risk and 
operational challenge for many security and IT teams.
Identity sprawl is a growing challenge. Talos IR research noted that it was 
challenging to identify how the credentials were compromised considering 
they were obtained from devices outside the companys visibility, such as 
saved credentials on an employees personal device. One report shared 
that on average, companies have 340\.5 personal accounts (Gmail, Yahoo, 
Hotmail, iCloud, etc.) with access to company data8\. With the BYOD and 
perimeter\-less work culture, a growing quantity of employee identities goes 
unchecked or unmanaged.

Establishing Device Trust
03
Gaining visibility into and securing myriad devices is still an ongoing battle, especially for 
organizations and industries that see a large diversity of endpoints such as higher education. 
Strong authentication mechanisms are at the heart of the security protocol an essential 
line of defense in confirming the identities of users accessing the network. However, robust 
authentication is just one piece of the cybersecurity puzzle.
Ensuring users are using trusted devices and networks to access corporate data adds 
another layer of complexity. IT environments with complex supply chain operations, third\-
party partnerships, and contractor devices introduce risk of outside, unmanaged devices and 
unknown endpoints. This variability makes it challenging, if not impossible, to guarantee visibility 
and trust without a dedicated layer of security. Even with strong end\-user authentication, the 
uncertainty of unmanaged network and device security remains a vulnerable chink in the armor.
In this context, identity\-centric security is a dynamic and multifaceted endeavor. It demands 
a strategy that is comprehensive and adaptive, integrating advanced authentication, network 
security solutions, endpoint protection, continuous monitoring, and an informed and 
conscientious workforce.
A Diverse Device Environment
The starting point for establishing device trust is gaining a comprehensive 
understanding of the devices themselves their operating systems, the 
browsers they use, their patch levels, and their compliance with corporate 
security policies. This understanding is critical because the security 
posture of any device is heavily influenced by the currency and integrity 
of its OS and browser. Outdated software can be riddled with unpatched 
vulnerabilities that are ripe for exploitation, turning an unassuming device 
into a Trojan horse within the network.
To determine if a device can be considered trustworthy, IT and
security teams must be able to answer several key questions: 
Are there any unauthorized applications or software present?
Is the device encrypted, and are its security settings
configured according to the enterprises standards?
What OS is the device running?
Is this OS still supported and receiving security updates?
What browser versions are installed, and are they set
to update automatically?

First, lets take a look at the browsers and OSes Duo customers use: 
Mobile and non\-traditional operating systems platforms show steady adoption, making up
61\.8% of measured authentications. While we find that Windows is still the frontrunner,
mixed IT environments can lead to more platform\-agnostic security considerations.
While Windows continues to lead the pack, we note that iOS is a strong second at 33\.4% in 
the overall listings. Apple continues to rule the roost in the mobile category with the nearest 
contender being Android, which has a far lower adoption rate at 28\.2%.

Device Visibility: Protecting What You Cant See 
Maintaining device trust is a continuous process, requiring regular assessments and updates. 
This might involve automated compliance checks that verify whether a device is operating 
within the set parameters before granting access. Should a device fall short say, running an 
OS version thats no longer supported it can be flagged for review, blocked from accessing 
sensitive resources, or provided with limited, controlled access to mitigate potential risks.
This is important as applications and browsers like Google Chrome up the frequency of patches, 
accounting for performance and security bug fixes on a weekly basis. But how often are
people relaunching and updating their applications? Of the 16 billion authentications measured, 
62% of non\-mobile authentications are attributed to the Chrome browser. The ability to see 
access device patch levels and prompt users to self\-remediate out\-of\-date devices grows
even more critical.
Visibility can be achieved through various tools and practices. Endpoint management systems, 
for instance, offer dashboards that provide real\-time insights into the status of every device 
connected to the network. Automated inventory tools can keep track of the devices in use, 
their software versions, and their patch history. This monitoring is essential not just for ongoing 
management but also for responding to potential security incidents with speed and precision.

Authentication with Out\-of\-Date Software
Out\-of\-date failures 
The percentage of failures due to out\-of\-date devices increased by 74\.7% in 2023\.
This is despite the fact that the percentage of organizations with policies governing
out\-of\-date devices decreased by 6\.9%. The Asia\-Pacific region ranked highest,
with 3\.8% of authentications occurring on an out\-of\-date browser. 
Figure 10 Typical (geometric mean) percentage of successful authentications using out\-of\-date browsers
The core of device trust lies in the ability to achieve complete visibility over the devices that
are requesting access to corporate applications and data. In the ever\-evolving geography
of digital threats, authenticating within an IT environment that relies on outdated software
is akin to navigating a ship with an old map.
Outdated software often contains unpatched vulnerabilities, which are like hidden,
open backdoors for cyber attackers. These vulnerabilities are well\-documented and
easily exploitable as they stay in the public domain, providing a treasure map for malicious
entities to gain unauthorized access. In this scenario, each authentication event is a gamble, 
increasing the chances that a security flaw can be used to compromise credentials.
Moreover, software that is past its support life no longer receives updates from its developers. 
This means that even as new threats emerge, the authentication mechanisms stay static and 
become increasingly ineffective against the sophisticated techniques employed by modern 
cyber adversaries. It is a static defense against a dynamic offense.

Figure 11 OS diversity and percentage of authentications that use an out\-of\-date operating system
The horizontal axis represents how diverse (in the ecological sense) a set of OSes is
used to authenticate within an organization. A higher number means a wider variety of OSes 
that share an equal proportion of authentications. On the vertical axis is the proportion of 
authentications made with out\-of\-date OSes. The line across the bottom shows organizations 
that enforce OSes to be up to date, and the vertical line on the left shows organizations that use 
only a single OS.
Based on the data in Figure 11, the correlation shows that the more operating systems an 
organization allows to authenticate, the more likely it is those authentications will occur with
an out\-of\-date OS. This becomes a fast reality for those expanding IT environments
To rely on outdated authentication software is to walk on a tightrope without a safety net. Its an 
open invitation to security breaches, data theft, and the many consequences that follow. For an 
IT environment to remain secure and effective, it is imperative to invest in current, robust device 
trust methods that evolve in lockstep with the landscape of digital threats, providing visibility
and enabling remediation. This is not just best practice; it is a fundamental tenet of responsible 
IT management in the digital age.

On Encryption \& Firewall 
With the hybrid work model, organizations must also consider the use of virtual private
networks (VPN), application of strict firewall policies, enforcement of data encryption, and 
secure setup of home networks. We looked at Duo Endpoint Health, particularly seeking to
find out if organizations were generally increasing or decreasing their use of various protections. 
On an organization\-by\-organization basis, we see that, on average, organizations increased the 
percentage of encryption usage by 69%.
Device hygiene for the enterprise is an ongoing, evolving requirement, not a set\-it\-and\-forget\-it 
policy. This responsibility extends to the end\-of\-life process for devices, ensuring that all data 
is securely wiped and that devices are disposed of in a manner that does not pose a security 
threat. Similarly, user access levels must be adjusted to mitigate unnecessary or excessive 
privileges. Regular audits and compliance checks ensure that device and identity hygiene 
practices are not just in place but are effectively enforced and updated.
By diligently managing and monitoring operating system and browsers, among other device 
attributes, organizations can enforce a strong security posture and ensure that trust is not 
blindly given, but is based on verifiable, compliant device behavior.

Powerful Policy Controls
In a previous section, we highlighted the critical challenge of security debt an accumulation of 
unaddressed risks and vulnerabilities that an organization must manage. Security debt can arise 
from various sources such as outdated software, legacy systems, technical shortcuts, and the 
delayed application of security patches. Reducing this debt is essential for maintaining a robust 
security posture and minimizing the organizations exposure to potential breaches.
One of the most effective strategies for mitigating security debt is through the comprehensive 
management of risk. This includes identifying, assessing, and prioritizing the vulnerabilities 
within an organizations IT infrastructure. By understanding where the greatest risks lie, an 
organization can allocate resources and efforts more effectively to address the most pressing 
security concerns first, thereby reducing the overall security debt.

Learning From When Authentications Fail
When reviewing the policy data, we uncovered some notable findings. 
In a move towards stronger methods of authentication, Duo Push\-based 
authentication was present in 99\.3% of all global policies. Mobile one\-time 
passcodes were in 91\.4% of policies defined. One of the more interesting 
findings was that WebAuthn was in 69\.2% of the global policies.
It is just as important, if not more so, to measure the authentications that 
failed. It was noted that 5% of all measured authentications were ones that 
failed. When we further examined the data, we discovered that 28% of the 
failed authentications were due to the users not being enrolled in the system.

Here we see that even though a little less than 1% of organizations have a policy concerning

Benefits of Strong Device\-Based Policies
A cornerstone of this risk reduction strategy is the implementation of uniform security policies 
across all assets in the environment. Device\-based policies are especially critical because they 
provide a consistent security framework that applies to every device within the organization, 
irrespective of its location or user. These policies can control various aspects of device security, 
including the enforcement of strong authentication measures, the application of regular patches 
and updates, the configuration of firewalls and antivirus software, and the management of
user privileges.
Uniform device\-based policies are beneficial for several reasons:
Consistency: They ensure that every device adheres to 
the same security standards, which helps to cut weak 
links in the security chain that attackers might exploit.
Scalability: As the organization grows, new devices 
can be brought into the fold with established policies 
automatically applied, making it easier to manage 
security at scale.
Compliance: Device\-based policies help organizations 
meet regulatory requirements by ensuring that all 
devices are compliant with industry standards and laws, 
reducing the risk of fines and other penalties.
Automation: These policies can often be enforced 
automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention 
and the associated human error.
Visibility and Control: Implementing uniform policies 
aids in the monitoring and control of device security,
as deviations from the policy are easier to detect
and remediate
30
 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.
Here are 3 types of policies that can help reduce complexity and
increase security coverage: 
Firstly, geo\-restrictions are a common security measure, especially in 
scenarios involving sensitive data regulated by legal or corporate policies 
dictating data residency and sovereignty. When a user attempts to access 
the system from a location that is not whitelisted, the security protocol 
promptly intervenes, resulting in a failed authentication. This geographical 
gating is an effective deterrent against a range of threats, including 
unauthorized access by international cybercriminals.
Top 3 Policy Groups to Reduce Security Debt
While reducing security debt is a complex, multifaceted endeavor, the foundation of this effort 
lies in the consistent application of comprehensive device\-based policies. Such an approach 
addresses the security debt at its root, reducing risk and fostering a more secure, resilient 
organizational environment.
The interplay between access devices and security policies is a critical facet of an 
organizations cybersecurity framework. Rigorous security policies are set in place to ensure 
that devices attempting to access corporate resources meet certain standards of security 
before they are granted entry into the network. When a device does not meet these prescribed 
criteria, it triggers a series of automated responses aimed at safeguarding the organizations 
digital assets.
Duos data shows that organizations that implement device\-based policies most commonly 
block access from locations they consider unsecure and from where access should not 
originate. Organizations also tend to set policies to block invalid and out\-of\-date devices and 
those that dont feature a screen lock or disk encryption, as those simple security steps can 
protect the device and the data it transmits from being viewed by others.
01
Based off our research, many organizations do not take the necessary 
step to implement geography\-based policies. In fact, we reported last year 
that the percentage of organizations who have any kind of policy denying 
specific geographic locations has dropped 20% since 2020\. In 2023,
96\.4% of organizations have no policy related to location (allow, deny,
or require 2FA). However, among those enterprises that do deny geographic 
locations, they block either Russia or China 91% of the time and 63% of 
those organizations block both countries.

Figure 14 Percentage of accounts with denial policies focused on specific countries 
Second, the use of invalid or outdated devices poses a significant risk. 
Devices that are no longer supported or have not been updated with the 
latest security patches are often riddled with vulnerabilities that can be 
exploited by cyber attackers. Security policies are designed to detect such 
devices based on their security posture which includes the operating 
system version, installed security patches, and other critical security 
configurations. If a device is found wanting in any of these areas, the user 
may be barred from logging in or prompted to update their device to comply 
with the current security standards.

Third, granular access policies at the per\-user group or per\-application 
level lay the groundwork for least privileged access. Organizations today 
rely on their third\-party ecosystems to supplement and support critical 
business functions. Aside from regulatory requirements, having unknown 
guest, dormant, or orphaned accounts can create additional management 
overhead and be a vector for unauthorized access to sensitive resources. 
Organizations should implement policies and procedures for managing 
accounts and limiting what they can access. This can include enforcing 
strong multi\-factor authentication, regularly reviewing and auditing guest 
accounts, and disabling those that are no longer needed.
According to the State of Identity Security Report 2023, the average 
organization has many inactive accounts \- more than 24% of its total 
identities. These accounts experience more than 500 attacks every
month. To add to user base complexity, more than 3\.24% of all
identities are guest accounts.
03
The average organization 
sees over 500 attacks on 
inactive accounts each year
To ensure these policies are effective, organizations must also invest in employee education 
and awareness. After all, the most sophisticated policies can be undermined by human error. 
Organizations should educate their users about the potential risks associated with guest 
accounts and the importance of granting access only to trusted external users. Regular
training sessions, simulations, and security drills can ingrain best practices and create a
vigilant workforce capable of identifying and responding to security threats proactively.
Such stringent access controls, while occasionally inconvenient for users, are a necessary 
defense in an era where the sophistication of cyberattacks continues to escalate. They 
ensure that only compliant devices and by extension, their users can interact with the 
organizations systems, thus preserving the integrity, confidentiality, and availability
of corporate data and services.

Closing Words
\+
The future of identity security
Identity sprawl foments vulnerabilities. However, traditional identity infrastructure was built
with IT operations in mind instead of security. Although the worlds of identity and security are 
coming together, in many larger organizations, security teams continue to work independently
of IAM teams. Talent shortage makes securing the organization even more challenging.
For small and mid\-sized organizations, the IT department may just be a handful of people 
wearing lots of hats. A security team may not even exist yet. New security technologies
such as identity threat detection and response can help bridge the gap between identity
and security teams.
In addition to operational challenges, organizations battle with human capital constraints, 
namely the reliance on people to manage identities. Identity security is complex and requires
an oversight of multiple elements, including:
User identity, which represents a specific user and 
is typically associated with unique credentials for 
authentication.
Device identity, which can be uniquely identified
and associated with a user.The status and 
trustworthiness of a device can affect a users
ability to access certain resources.
Attributes or properties of an identity, such as a users 
role, location, department, etc. Attributes can be used to 
determine and enforce access policies.
Permissions and access rights given to an identity, 
determining what resources that identity can access 
and what actions they can perform.
35
 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.
When IAM hygiene is poor, organizations identity attack surfaces increase and provide 
additional opportunities to attackers. As more relationships are created between devices, 
attributes, identities and permissions, it becomes increasingly difficult to see and keep track
of which identities are doing what.
Investigating incidents is also challenging without a solution that brings identity\-related data 
together from multiple sources or helps pass contextualized posture information from IT
to SOC.Visibility into misconfigured and unused accounts, including employees, contractors, 
and service accounts is also vital.
Having identity threat detection and response capabilities under one roof with access 
management is becoming a necessity. In tandem, these capabilities can help minimize
chances of successful identity\-based attacks while offering holistic coverage across
identities and applications.
To address identity\-based attacks with greater efficacy, IAM analytics need to be an inherent 
part of such a solution. This way, IT administrators can quickly address any security gaps by 
migrating from weak authentication to strong, phishing\-resistant, multi\-factor passwordless 
deployments across a customers entire enterprise stack.
Context is the new MFA
In a world where data is king, but context is key, strong access management does not 
just continue to strengthen corporate security it reshapes it. It addresses the inherent 
weaknesses of password\-dependent systems and establishes a more robust, dynamic defense 
against the ever\-evolving threat landscape.
Detailed logging and alerting mechanisms are essential to make sense of the noise. An attempt 
to authenticate via MFA can trigger alerts if the second or third factor fails, offering real\-time 
threat detection and allowing for immediate response. This can greatly reduce the dwell time, 
the interval between a breach and its detection, which is crucial in mitigating the damage 
inflicted by a security incident.
We know that when navigating uncharted complexities, the steps we need to take can be
easy to understand but hard to implement. As cyber threats grow in complexity and subtlety, 
adopting IAM best practices stands as a necessary evolution of security protocolsintegral
to safeguarding the assets, reputation, and future of any modern organization.
36
 2024 Cisco andor its affiliates. All rights reserved.
Recommendations
 
Organization\-wide adoption of strong MFA and moving towards requiring only
phishing\-resistant MFA such as FIDO2 security keys for privileged accounts.
 
Enable Verified Duo Push which disarms push harassment and push fatigue attacks and 
puts your organization on the path towards passwordless.
 
Ensure only trusted devices, managed or unmanaged, are granted access to
corporate resources.
 
Set data\-informed user authentication policies that consider your organizations risk levels 
and focus points, with intelligent factor step\-up that doesnt impede user productivity.
 
Leverage a modern single sign\-on solution as a policy enforcement tool to apply
principles of zero trust and least privilege access for each application.
 
Take advantage of solutions that assess user and device telemetry to identify known
threat patterns and anomalies, like Duo Risk\-Based Authentication. Evaluate login
attempts for context and risk.
 
Identify the IAM complexities in your environment with ITDR and assess weak
points based on how much visibility you have. Leverage Identity Threat Detection 
and Response capabilities to get visibility across your identity ecosystem in a single, 
comprehensive interface.
