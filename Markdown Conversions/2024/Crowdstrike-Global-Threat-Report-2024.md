GLOBA LT HRE ATR EPOR T2ForewordThe 2024 edition of the CrowdStrike Global Threat Report arrives ata pivotal moment for our global community of protectors. The speedand ferocity of cyberattacks continue to accelerate as adversariescompress the time between initial entry, lateral movement and breach.At the same time, the rise of generative AI has the potential to lower thebarrier of entry for low\-skilled adversaries, making it easier to launchattacks that are more sophisticated and state of the art.These trends are driving a tectonic shift in the security landscape andthe world. The good enough approach to cybersecurity is simply nolonger good enough for modern threats. As organizations increasinglymove business to the cloud, adversaries are advancing their capabilitiesto exploit this, and abuse features unique to the cloud. We continue tosee identity\-based attacks take center stage, as adversaries focus onsocial engineering attacks that bypass multifactor authentication.The use of legitimate tools to execute an attack, an increasinglyprevalent technique, impedes the ability to differentiate betweennormal activity and a breach.We are entering an era of a cyber arms race where AI will amplifythe impact for both the security professional and the adversary.Organizations cannot afford to fall behind, and the legacy technologyof yesterday is no match for the speed and sophistication of themodern adversary.With the release of the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report, ourelite Counter Adversary Operations team is delivering the actionableintelligence you need to stay ahead of todays threats and secure yourfuture. This years report provides critical insight and observations intoadversary activity, including: The tactics and techniques that adversaries use to exploitgaps in cloud protection The continued exploitation of stolen identity credentialsand increasingly sophisticated methods adversaries use to gaininitial access The growing menace of supply chain attacks and exploitationof trusted software to maximize the ROI of attacks The potential for adversaries to target global elections in a year

5IntroductionAs we reflect on the 2023 cyber threat landscape, the theme of stealth prevails.Adversaries have faced a hardening attack surface thanks to advancements in threatdefense technology and threat awareness, and they have responded by increasinglyadopting and relying on techniques that empower them to move faster and evadedetection.These techniques are evident in the consistent prevalence of eCrime, a highly attractiveand lucrative business venture for many criminals. Unsurprisingly, eCrime persisted asthe most pervasive threat across the 2023 threat landscape as adversaries leveragedtechniques to maximize stealth, speed and impact.DATA\-THEFT EXTORTION CONTINUESTO BE AN ATTRACTIVE AND OFTENEASIER MONETIZATION ROUTE, ASEVIDENCED BY THE 76% INCREASE INTHE NUMBER OF VICTIMS NAMED ONBGH DEDICATED LEAK SITESWhile ransomware remains the tool of choice for many big game hunting(BGH) adversaries, data\-theft extortion continues to be an attractive and ofteneasier monetization route, as evidenced by the 76% increase in the number ofvictims named on BGH dedicated leak sites (DLSs) between 2022 and 2023\.Access brokers continued to profit by providing initial access to eCrime threatactors throughout the year, with the number of advertised accesses increasingby 20% from 2022\.Nation\-state adversaries were also active throughout 2023\. China\-nexus adversariescontinued to operate at an unmatched pace across the global landscape, leveragingstealth and scale to collect targeted group surveillance data, strategic intelligence andintellectual property.In other areas of the world, conflict continued to drive nation\-state and hacktivistadversary activity. In 2023, as the Russia\-Ukraine war entered its second year,Russia\-nexus adversaries and activity clusters maintained high, sustained levels ofactivity in support of Russian Intelligence Service intelligence collection, disruptiveactivity, and information operations (IO) targeting Ukraine and NATO countries.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

The assessed geographic range of this activity, as well asthe capabilities and target scope of global threat actors, continued to underscorethe extent to which targeted intrusion capabilities have proliferated beyond thosedemonstrated by commonly reported countries. In some cases, this activitywas assisted by private sector offensive actors and openly available adversaryemulation frameworks.One of the greatest threat actor motivations driving stealth in cyber threatoperations is CrowdStrikes development of new products and partnershipsthroughout 2023\. These changed the stakes within the operational landscape andleft adversaries with no place to hide.In 2023, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence and CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatchmerged to become CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations (CAO). Combiningthe power of threat intelligence with the speed of dedicated hunting teams andtrillions of cutting\-edge telemetry events from the AI\-native CrowdStrike Falconplatform that detect, disrupt and stop todays sophisticated adversaries, thismerger has exponentially raised the business cost of conducting cyberattacks.In 2024, CrowdStrike CAO repackaged CrowdStrikes threat intelligence modulesto add managed threat hunting (an industry first), empowering organizations tobetter pursue adversaries and stop breaches.Over the course of 2023, CrowdStrike CAO introduced 34 new adversaries including a newly tracked, Egypt\-based adversary, WATCHFUL SPHINX raisingthe total number of actors tracked across all motivations to 232\. In addition tonamed adversaries, CrowdStrike CAO tracks more than 130 active maliciousactivity clusters.CrowdStrike CAO drives unparalleled, actionable reporting coverage thatcaptures new cyber threat developments in real time and identifies and tracksnew adversaries. The CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report sheds light on thestandout trends from last year, how adversaries activities and motivations areevolving and the ways CrowdStrike anticipates the threat landscape will evolvein the coming year.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

10Todays cyber threats are particularly alarming due to the widespread use of hands\-on or interactiveintrusion techniques, which involve adversaries actively executing actions on a host to accomplish theirobjectives. Unlike malware attacks that depend on the deployment of malicious tooling and scripts,interactive intrusions leverage the creativity and problem\-solving skills of human adversaries. Theseindividuals can mimic expected user and administrator behavior, making it difficult for defenders todifferentiate between legitimate user activity and a cyberattack.In 2023, CrowdStrike observed a 60% year\-over\-year increase in the number of interactive intrusioncampaigns, with a 73% increase in the second half compared to 2022\.The technology sector was the most frequently targeted industry in which CrowdStrike CAO observedinteractive intrusion activity in 2023, a continuing trend from 2022\. The charts below reflect the relativefrequency of intrusions in the top 10 industry verticals and in geographical regions.Interactive Intrusions by Region6%11%1%5%7%4%61%5%NORTH AMERICAEUROPESOUTH ASIAEAST ASIASOUTH AMERICAMIDDLE EASTOCEANIAAFRICAInteractive Intrusions by Industry23%15%13%9%9%8%8%6%4%4%TECHNOLOGY TELECOMMUNICATIONSFINANCIALGOVERNMENTRETAILMANUFACTURINGHEALTHCARESERVICESEDUCATIONMEDIAAfter gaining initial access to a network, adversaries seek to break out and move laterally from thecompromised host to other hosts within the environment. The time it takes for them to do this breakout time is crucial because the initially compromised machines are rarely the ones adversariesneed to achieve their goals. They must move laterally into the network, conduct reconnaissance, establishpersistence and locate their targets. Responding within the breakout time window allows defenders tomitigate costs and other damages associated with intrusions.This year, the average breakout time for interactive eCrime intrusion activity decreased from 84 minutes in2022 to 62 minutes in 2023\. The fastest observed breakout time was only 2 minutes and 7 seconds.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

BeginsIn this case, the security team had the quarantine on write policy settingdisabled, enabling the four files to be written to disk. The adversaryexecuted a legitimate tool to obtain system information for reconnaissanceand then dropped three more files, including ransomware, onto the system.They attempted to execute a network discovery and reconnaissance toolto map out lateral movement options, which was immediately blocked andquarantined by the Falcon sensor. This caused the adversary to open thecontrol panel to understand which security tool was in use. When theyidentified the Falcon platform, they never attempted to execute the seconddiscovery tool or the ransomware (which would have been prevented andquarantined) and moved to another victim. Within minutes, CrowdStrike CAOthreat hunters notified the customer, took the machine offline and reset theuser password.Once an initial compromise occurs, it only takes seconds for adversaries todrop tools andor malware on a victims environment during an interactiveintrusion. However, the saying time is money holds true for adversaries.More than 88% of the attack time was dedicated to breaking in and gaininginitial access. By reducing or eliminating this time, adversaries free upresources to conduct more attacks.To do this, they have continued to move beyond malware to faster, moreeffective means such as identity attacks (phishing, social engineeringand access brokers) and the exploitation of vulnerabilities and trustedrelationships. This trend is apparent over the last five years, as malware\-freeactivity represented 75% of detections in 2023 up from 71% in 2022\.Attack Disrupted:

12This trend is partly related to the success of identity attacks, accessbrokers and the prolific abuse of valid credentials to facilitate access andpersistence in victim environments. Access brokers are threat actors whoacquire access to organizations and provide or sell this access to otheractors, including ransomware operators. These adversaries continued toprofit from providing initial access to a variety of eCrime threat actors in2023, with the number of accesses advertised increasing by almost 20%compared to 2022\.Access Broker Advertisements by MonthMonthJANFEBMARAPRMAYJUNEJULYAUGSEPTOCTNOVDEC150891601343522111721942393924494503090150210270330390450TOTAL \= 2,9922023Todays sophisticated cyberattacks only take minutes to succeed.Adversaries use techniques such as interactive hands\-on\-keyboardattacks and legitimate tools to attempt to hide from detection. To furtheraccelerate attack tempo, adversaries can access credentials in multipleways, including purchasing them from access brokers for a few hundreddollars. Organizations must prioritize protecting identities in 2024\.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

ThemesIDENTITY\-BASED ANDSOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKSAdversaries spanning multiple motivations and regions continue to usephishing techniques spoofing legitimate users to target valid accounts,as well as other authentication and identifying data, to conduct their attacks.In addition to stealing account credentials, CrowdStrike CAO observedadversaries targeting API keys and secrets, session cookies and tokens,one\-time passwords (OTPs) and Kerberos tickets throughout 2023\.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT14ACCOUNT CREDENTIALSAdversaries can authenticate to a system andor user account usingstolen credentials, which can either be obtained by the adversarydirectly (for example, using information stealers or exploitingunmanaged edge devices) or by purchasing them.API KEYS AND SECRETSAccess to protected resources using stolen API keys and secrets mayallow an adversary to steal sensitive data. Unless the API keys andsecrets are changed, the adversary could maintain indefinite access.SESSION COOKIES AND TOKENSAdversaries can steal session cookies and tokens to masquerade as thelegitimate user and authenticate to an application.ONE\-TIME PASSWORDS (OTPs)OTP theft allows the adversary to bypass multifactor authentication(MFA) by SIM swapping, SS7 attacks, socially engineering the victim oremail compromise.KERBEROS AND KERBEROS TICKETSBy stealing or forging Kerberos tickets, adversaries can gain access toencrypted credentials, which can then be cracked offline.

15BEAR Adversaries 
Conduct Credential 
Collection CampaignsFANCY BEAR conducted regular credential collection campaigns throughout 2023\.In March 2023, Microsoft patched a zero\-day elevation\-of\-privilege vulnerabilityin Microsoft Outlook (CVE\-2023\-23397\), which FANCY BEAR had been exploitingsince at least March 2022 to solicit NT LAN Manager authentication sessions fromtargets using specially crafted spear\-phishing emails. The Polish Cyber Commandreported that the adversary used this authentication data to connect to Exchangeservers and change additional high\-value account mailbox permissions through 
the Exchange Web Services protocol.1FANCY BEAR also conducted credential phishing campaigns and developed acustom toolkit to capture credentials from Yahoo! Mail and ukr.net webmail users.The adversary expanded this toolkit to use the Browser\-in\-the\-Browser techniquein April 2023 and added MFA interception capabilities to its toolkit to collect OTPssent to the MFA contact (e.g a phone number) linked to the targeted account.COZY BEAR has conducted credential phishing campaigns using Microsoft Teamsmessages to solicit MFA tokens for Microsoft 365 accounts since at least late May2023\. If a user accepts its initial message request, COZY BEAR attempts to sociallyengineer the target by claiming a change was made to their current MFA settingsand stating an MFA code is required for verification.CrowdStrike Services has observed COZY BEAR connecting to a compromisedaccount using Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure Active Directory) beforeregistering a new device and enabling a passwordless phone sign\-in for the user.The adversary also exported certificates containing private keys and requested aKRBTGT\-authentication ticket for a different account using a legitimately issuedcertificate.1https:www.wojsko\-polskie.plwocarticlesaktualnosci\-wdetecting\-malicious\-activity\-against\-

16SCATTERED SPIDER 
Conducts Sophisticated 
Social Engineering CampaignsIdentity\-based techniques are also central to SCATTERED SPIDER tradecraft.Throughout 2023, this adversary conducted sophisticated social engineeringcampaigns to access victim accounts. SCATTERED SPIDERs tactics included SMSphishing (smishing) and voice phishing (vishing) to harvest credentials; it alsoto provide password andor MFA resets for targeted accounts. In many cases,SCATTERED SPIDER also leveraged earlier intrusions at telecom organizationsto SIM swap targeted employee phone numbers, enabling the adversary to thenreceive SMS messages containing OTP codes.SCATTERED SPIDER deliberately selects social engineering campaign targetsfrom employees in information security and other IT\-related teams. This islikely due to direct employee access to security tools as well as applicationsand documentation that may support lateral movement and further accountcompromise. In a minority of incidents, SCATTERED SPIDER targeted accountsbelonging to employees who had direct access to company financial resources.Additionally, SCATTERED SPIDER often configured residential proxies to appear asthough they were logging in to victim accounts from the same geographical areaas the legitimate account owner. In doing so, the adversary further exhibited itsunderstanding of identity\-related security policies in enterprise organizations.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

Next are several observations of cloud\- andidentity\-focused activities categorized by the MITRE ATT\&CK enterprisetactics of Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Credential Access,Lateral Movement, Exfiltration and Impact.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT18Initial AccessAdversaries relied on valid credentials to achieve initial access.They obtained these credentials via accidental credential leakage, brute\-forceattacks, phishingsocial engineering, credential stealers, access brokers, insecureself\-service password\-reset services and insider threats.IN THE WILDFANCY BEAR AND SCATTERED SPIDER COMMONLY TARGETED MICROSOFT 365CREDENTIALS VIA CREDENTIAL\-PHISHING ATTACKS.PersistenceTo maintain access to Azure and Microsoft 365, adversaries commonly achievedpersistence at the identity level.IN THE WILDACHIEVING PERSISTENCE AT THE IDENTITY LEVEL IS COMMONLY ACHIEVEDBY REGISTERING ADDITIONAL AUTHENTICATION FACTORS IN ENTRA ID.SCATTERED SPIDER USED AN IDENTITY PROVIDER TO ESTABLISHPERSISTENCE WITH A FEDERATED DOMAIN IN ENTRA ID, INITIALLYRELYING ON AADINTERNALS AZURE AD BACKDOOR.2 THIS PROVIDEDTHE ADVERSARY WITH PERSISTENT ACCESS TO MULTIPLE ENTRA IDIDENTITIES.

This type of attack takes advantageof vendor\-client relationships to deploy malicious tooling via two keytechniques: 1\) compromising the software supply chain using trustedsoftware to spread malicious tooling and 2\) leveraging access to vendorssupplying IT services.Threat actors targeting third\-party relationships are motivated by thepotential return on investment (ROI): One compromised organization canlead to hundreds or thousands of follow\-on targets.

Trusted\-Relationship Compromises by 
China\-Nexus AdversariesIn 2023, China\-nexus adversaries increasingly targeted third\-party relationshipsin efforts to deploy malicious implants and gain initial access. Two adversaries JACKPOT PANDA and CASCADE PANDA consistently exploited trustedrelationships through supply chain compromises and actor\-on\-the\-sideor actor\-in\-the\-middle attacks. In each case, the operations focused onChinese\-speaking victims, possibly indicating ongoing domestic surveillance.Throughout 2023, JACKPOT PANDA continued to use trojanized executables to deploymalicious utilities or second\-stage implants. Beginning in May 2023, the adversaryused a trojanized installer for CloudChat, a China\-based chat application popular withillegal, Chinese\-speaking gambling communities in Mainland China. The trojanizedinstaller served from CloudChats website contained the first stage of a multi\-stepprocess that ultimately deployed XShade a novel implant with code that overlapswith JACKPOT PANDAs unique CplRAT implant.Additional JACKPOT PANDA activity was identified in May 2023 using a signed.NET downloader, dubbed QuestDownloader, launched by a LiveHelp100 process.LiveHelp100 is associated with Comm100, a software utility targeted by a JACKPOTPANDA supply chain compromise in September 2022\. QuestDownloader was ultimatelyused to deploy Cobalt Strike and UltraVNC.Beginning in late 2023, CASCADE PANDA routinely used likely actor\-in\-the\-middle oractor\-on\-the\-side attacks to intercept legitimate update traffic from common utilities,as well as Chinese\-language tools, to deploy WinDealer a malicious remote accesstool (RAT) uniquely associated with this adversary. In all CASCADE PANDA instancesfrom this time period, legitimate software update processes connected to legitimateinfrastructure associated with respective products and legitimate Chinese internetservice provider infrastructure.CASCADE PANDA likely distributes WinDealer by using domestic infrastructureto redirect legitimate traffic in transit. In one instance, CASCADE PANDA used alegitimate trojanized Chinese\-language translation tool executable to deploy WinDealer.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT22Unattributed targeted intrusion actors using TTPs consistent with China\-nexusadversaries also exploited trusted relationships to conduct operations in 2023\.Throughout the second half of the year, an unattributed actor compromised anIndia\-based information security software vendor and used the resulting access todistribute trojanized executables via legitimate software update processes.These attacks target victims from multiple regions and industries, including theconstruction, financial services, government, technology, telecom and logisticssectors throughout the U.S India, Brazil, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Zambia,Mexico and Malaysia. Though this trusted\-relationship exploitation activity remainsunattributed, the final payload used in this attack shares significant code overlapswith BackShell and StealthPipes, two tools uniquely attributed to WET PANDA.A second unattributed actor was observed in late 2023 distributing ShadowPad tosuspected Chinese\-speaking targets as part of a likely supply chain compromise.The actor compromised a China\-based virtual conference platform and leveragedthe resulting access to deploy a trojanized ShadowPad installer masqueradingas a legitimate software tool. Though this activity is unattributed, ShadowPad isexclusively used by China\-nexus adversaries such as AQUATIC PANDA, WICKEDPANDA and VAPOR PANDA.In early 2023, an unattributed actor likely compromised an update serverassociated with iPhone i4Tools management software to deploy AvanteGarde, amalware framework associated with China\-nexus activity cluster InnateSpark.Though CrowdStrike CAO was able to confirm at least 250 customers hadconnected to the compromised update server, only 10% received the maliciousupdate, possibly indicating the actor down\-selected high\-value targets.Threat Highlight: 
North Koreas Supply Chain 
CompromisesDemocratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) adversaries also demonstratedan increased interest in exploiting trusted relationships in 2023\. In particular,LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA abused a trusted relationship between a technologyvendor and a client in three instances last year, highlighting an interest in usingsupply chain compromises as an intrusion vector.This exploitation tradecraft was first observed in March 2023, when an adversarycompromised software at VoIP provider 3CX. This compromise appears to havestarted with an upstream supply chain compromise of financial technology firmTrading Technologies. The adversary used trojanized 3CX Electron Windowsand macOS desktop application variants to deliver information stealers to victimenvironments. The threat actors then persisted with a July 2023 campaign thatsimilarly abused access to a technology company in efforts to compromise itsproduct and use legitimate infrastructure to infiltrate the compromisedcompanys clientele.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT23CrowdStrike CAO also observed LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA distributing malwarevia a trojanized CyberLink media player variant. This campaign stands out amongother LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA supply chain compromises, as the adversary usedexecution guardrails that limited the campaign to a specific geography andtemporal window, suggesting the targeting of a particular victim set.The motivation driving these compromises remains undefined. In one supply chaincompromise, CrowdStrike CAO detected trojanized software in the environmentsof 62 customers; however, subsequent supply chain compromises were morelimited in scope. The adversary may be using supply chain compromises to cast awide net and deliver appropriate follow\-on tooling to interesting targets.LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA is equally likely abusing trusted relationships betweensuppliers and product users to infiltrate specific high\-value targets for currencygeneration and espionage campaigns. CrowdStrike CAO assesses that additionalLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA supply chain compromises are increasingly likely to occurin the near future. The adversary likely considers supply chain compromise auseful tactic with potential to streamline operations. This assessment is madewith moderate confidence based on the volume of supply chain compromisesobserved in 2023\.Outlook: 
Third\-Party Relationship ExploitationTrusted\-relationship compromises will continue to attract targeted intrusion actors in the immediate future.The high ROI for these attacks, particularly in terms of access to potential downstream compromises relativeto the limited effort required to compromise one target, will likely motivate attacks throughout 2024\.Organizations operating in the technology sector are uniquely at risk from third\-party relationship exploitation.In 2023, nearly every trusted\-relationship compromise originated as part of an intrusion at a technology sectororganization that provided commercial software.24VULNERABILITY LANDSCAPE:UNDER THE RADAR EXPLOITATIONThreat actors have adapted to the enhanced visibility of traditional endpoint detection and response(EDR) sensors by altering their exploitation tactics for initial access and lateral movement. They are nowtargeting the network periphery, where defender visibility is reduced by the possibility that endpoints maylack EDR sensors or cannot support sensor deployment (Figure 3\).MANAGED

These devices are commonly based on obsolete architecture, leading tobroadly exploited vulnerabilities in firewall and VPN platforms from Cisco (CVE\-2023\-20198\), Citrix (CVE\-2023\-3519, CVE\-2023\-4966\) and F5 (CVE\-2023\-46747\).Exploitation was also observed in various other unmanaged devices throughout2023\. Targeted intrusion actors likely engaged in opportunistic Ivanti mobile devicemanagement application targeting via CVE\-2023\-35078 and CVE\-2023\-35082\.Akira ransomware operators leveraged exploits for CVE\-2023\-27532 avulnerability in Veeam Backup \& Replication to pivot into victim backup storageinfrastructure. Additionally, eCrime actors developed zero\-day exploits fortelephony products based on an abandoned open\-source project.The latter zero\-day exploit relates to another trend observed in 2023: a focuson EOL product exploitation. Threat actors are actively developing exploits forEOL products that cannot be patched and often do not allow for modern sensordeployment. Unsupported operating system (OS) servers and legacy gatewayappliances offer easy access even to otherwise antiquated malware families leading to lingering infections that distract resources from contemporary securityissues.Increasing defender visibility to such exploit vectors is key in mitigating the riskposed by these tactics. CrowdStrike Falcon Surface can be leveraged to monitorand reduce internet\-exposed services and maintain an application inventory acrossan organizations attack surface. Defenders should prioritize patching exposedproducts, particularly open\-source platforms, when the products are subject toknown remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. Finally, CrowdStrike FalconSpotlight can determine whether sensor\-deployed assets are subject to knownvulnerabilities and when these endpoints have reached EOL.2023 ISRAEL\-HAMAS CONFLICT: CYBER OPERATIONSFOCUS ON DISRUPTION AND INFLUENCEOn October 7, 2023, Hamas military wing Izz al\-Din al\-Qassam Brigades (IDQB) and several other Gaza\-based militantgroups launched a massive kinetic attack against Israel, killing hundreds of Israelis and taking hostages. In the ensuingmonths, CrowdStrike CAO tracked ongoing cyber operations from targeted intrusion and hacktivist actors. Activityand claims from both groups primarily focus on targeting operational technology or other critical systems likely topsychologically influence target populations and deploying destructive wipers against Israeli or Israel\-linked entities.Most conflict\-driven cyber operations observed include hacktivist activity and operations by suspected faketivists.Within the context of the Israel\-Hamas conflict, the dividing line between these two threat actor types has blurred,as genuine hacktivist groups often amplify the claims of, or provide support to, likely state\-nexus inauthentic personas.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT26 \> HAMAS AND ALLIED MILITANT GROUPS ATTACK ISRAEL \> NUMEROUS REGIONAL HACKTIVIST GROUPS CLAIM DDOS ATTACKS ON ISRAELI ENTITIES \> Anonymous Sudan AND GHOST JACKAL CLAIM DISRUPTIVE ACTIVITY TARGETING ISRAELIAERIAL PROJECTILE WARNING SYSTEMS \> PRO\-IRGC GROUP Rights Seekers CLAIM ISRAELI MILITARY CRAM NATIONAL WARNINGSYSTEM TARGETING \> IRGC\-AFFILIATED Cyber Av3ngers CLAIMS ATTACKS AGAINST CRITICAL ISRAELIINFRASTRUCTURE \> ISRAEL IMPLEMENTS FOUR\-HOUR CEASEFIRE IN NORTHERN GAZA \> HAYWIRE KITTEN\-LINKED al\-Toufan Team LAUNCHESHACK\-AND\-LEAK AND DDOS OPERATIONS \> IRANIAN Rights Seekers GROUP TARGETS CRITICAL ISRAELI INFRASTRUCTURE \> Cyber Av3ngers TARGETS U.S. ICS \> HEZBOLLAH TARGETS ISRAEL WITH

Noticeably Absent from 
Conflict\-Related ActivityCrowdStrike CAO\-assessed, likely Gaza\-based adversaries EXTREME JACKALand RENEGADE JACKAL demonstrate support for strategic Hamas interests.Additionally, evidence suggests the CruelAlchemy activity cluster represents aHamas\-linked cyber operations unit physically present in Turkey.RENEGADE JACKAL was the most active Hamas\-nexus adversary throughout2023\. The group primarily targeted Middle East\-based government entities withits custom Micropsia Windows malware and Android implants. In mid\-October 2023,CrowdStrike CAO linked RENEGADE JACKAL to the Jerusalem Electronic Army, anostensible hacktivist group Hamas officials previously indicated was in supportof the IDQB Cyberwarfare Unit.Open\-source reporting identified activity, allegedly attributable to Hamas,targeting Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) personnel. However, CrowdStrike CAO hasno further evidence to suggest the aforementioned adversaries are currently 
targeting Israeli entities in connection with recent events in Israel and Gaza.3Since the onset of the conflict, internet connectivity in the Gaza Strip has beensignificantly degraded almost certainly due to a combination of kinetic activity,power outages and distributed denial\-of\-service (DDoS) attacks.Power and internet disruptions have likely hindered Gaza\-based adversaryoperations. Though no CruelAlchemy activity has been observed in directassociation with the Israel\-Hamas conflict, identified command\-and\-control(C2\) infrastructure indicates the actor remained active following the onset ofthe conflict, possibly supporting prior reporting that suggests CruelAlchemyoperates from outside of Gaza.Widespread Hacktivist Operations

Known and previously unobserved hacktivists within the conflict regionand from around the world claimed the activity, a significant portion of whichrevolved around attempted or alleged aerial projectile warning system and criticalinfrastructure disruption targeting Israel. A smaller number of hacktivists alsoextended their operations beyond the conflict region to target countries or entitiesdeemed supportive of Israel.3https:www.timesofisrael.comliveblog\_entryidf\-exposes\-catfishing\-network\-seeking\-to\-extract\-info\-from\-troops\-on\-hamass\-behalfCROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 
28Aerial Projectile Warning Systems 
and Critical Infrastructure TargetingMultiple hacktivist entities have targeted aerial projectile warning systems in Israeland claimed to have disrupted IDF counter\-rocket, artillery and mortar systemsto prevent notification delivery andor send false imminent attack notifications toIsraeli citizens. Observed targeting of these services decreased after mid\-October2023; however, a surge of kinetic activity in the region could ignite a renewedinterest in further disruption or false notifications.Throughout the duration of the conflict, pro\-Palestine hacktivists have consistentlytargeted critical infrastructure in Israel, including disruptive activity againstenergy\-distribution infrastructure and water pumps, DDoS attacks against utilitycompanies, and hack\-and\-leak operations against water treatment and energyplants. This activity is likely an attempt to inflict physical and psychologicaldamage on Israeli citizens and will likely continue throughout the duration of theIsrael\-Hamas conflict. This assessment is made with high confidence based onconsistent targeting to date and similar activity observed in other recent conflicts,such as the Russia\-Ukraine war.Operations Beyond the Immediate 
Conflict RegionLimited hacktivist activity extended beyond the immediate conflict area inretaliation against real or perceived support of Israel. On October 12, 2023, Yemenigroup Team R70 claimed a DDoS attack against a U.Sbased airport, alleging theairport receives the most Israeli air traffic.On October 14, 2023, prominent South Asian hacktivist group Team InsanePakistan claimed a DDoS attack against a British military website. This activity wasaccompanied by references to U.K. support for Israel.On October 16, 2023, a likely Indonesian hacktivist group calling itself INFINITEINSIGHT shared leaked data, claiming to have breached the personally identifiableinformation (PII) of nearly 790,000 doctors in the United States. The alleged leakwas reportedly in retaliation against U.S. support for Israel as well as to showsupport for Palestinians.Hacktivists will likely continue limited targeting of countries and entities beyondthe conflict region that they perceive as supporting Israel. This assessmentis made with high confidence based on consistent activity observed to dateand in similar conflicts, such as the Russia\-Ukraine war, as well as observedcommunications within hacktivist channels.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT31Outlook: 
Cyber Operations in the ConflictUnlike in the Russia\-Ukraine war, where known cyber operations have directly contributed to the conflict,those involved in the Israel\-Hamas conflict have not directly contributed to Hamas military operations againstIsrael. The full breadth and effects of activity targeting Israel, particularly by Iranian state\-nexus adversariesand allied proxies, are almost certainly not fully known. However, identified incidents have largely beenmisaligned with early concerns that Iranian cyberattacks could cause significant disruptions across criticalsectors in Israel and broaden in scope to allied countries. This misalignment may point to Iranian forcesincapability or lack of preparedness and their desire to avoid an unintended escalation that could draw Iranmore directly into the conflict.CrowdStrike CAO tracks activity clusters SpoiledMocha and Moonshuttle. These are reportedly aligned withIrans regional proxies the Houthi movement in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon, respectively eventhough these entities have not yet been observed within the Israel\-Hamas conflict context.Pro\-Iraqi Shia militia hacktivist groups have demonstrated consistent involvement in targeting Israeli entitiessince the onset of the conflict. An escalation in kinetic hostilities could lead to related activity from thesegroups.Hacktivist activity will almost certainly continue apace with fluctuations in related geopolitical developments.This assessment is made with high confidence based on the activity patterns exhibited to date as well asconsistent patterns observed across other similar conflicts.32GENERATIVE AI HAS MASSIVELYDEMOCRATIZED COMPUTING TOIMPROVE ADVERSARY OPERATIONS.IT CAN ALSO POTENTIALLY LOWERTHE ENTRY BARRIER TO THETHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR LESSSOPHISTICATED THREAT ACTORS.THREATS ON THE2024 HORIZONAs organizations plan for potential threats emerging in 2024, twopotential disruption drivers come to the forefront: generative AI and2024 global government elections.Generative AI Use Within 
the Threat LandscapeMainstream accessible generative AI technology exploded in late 2022,opening up a new realm of possibilities for efficient content creation anddrawing the attention of adversaries seeking ways to exploit this newtechnology for their own purposes.Generative AI has massively democratized computing to improveadversary operations. It can also potentially lower the entry barrier tothe threat landscape for less sophisticated threat actors.Two primary generative AI opportunity areas within the threatlandscape include: Developing andor executing malicious computer networkoperations (CNO), including tool and resource development such asscripts or code that could be functionally malicious if used correctly Supporting the efficiency and effectiveness of social engineeringand information operations campaignsGenerative AI in MaliciousComputer Network OperationsIts difficult to confidently gauge the probability of adversariesusing newer technologies such as generative AI in their operations,particularly in relation to how these technologies will support maliciousCNO. Only rare concrete observations included likely adversary use ofgenerative AI during some operational phases.CrowdStrikes visibility into the use of such tools is likely incomplete.This is either a result of limited observations, the fact that the AI\-generated material did not intrinsically leave significant indicators of itstrue nature or adversaries taking steps to avoid revealing evidence thatgenerative AI was in use.Throughout 2023, generative AI was rarely observed supportingmalicious CNO development andor execution.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT33INDRIK
SPIDERIn February 2023, CrowdStrike Services responded to anINDRIK SPIDER incident involving BITWISE SPIDERs LockBitRED ransomware. During this incident, INDRIK SPIDERexfiltrated credentials from cloud\-based credential managerAzure Key Vault. Logs show that INDRIK SPIDER also visitedChatGPT while interacting with the Azure Portal.In addition to visiting ChatGPT while browsing the AzurePortal presumably to understand how to navigate inAzure browsing activity analysis indicates INDRIK SPIDERused search engines such as Google and Bing and searchedon GitHub during the operations to understand how toexfiltrate Azure Key Vault credentials.Using search engines and visiting ChatGPT indicate thatthough INDRIK SPIDER is likely new to the cloud and not yetsophisticated in this domain, it is using generative AI to fillthese knowledge gaps.SCATTERED
SPIDERIn the second half of 2023, SCATTERED SPIDER used theAzure AD PowerShell module to download all Entra IDuser immutable IDs at a North American financial servicesvictim. Using its Entra ID backdoor, the adversary could login as any of the downloaded users. The PowerShell usedto download the users immutable IDs resembled largelanguage model (LLM) outputs such as those from ChatGPT.In particular, the pattern of one comment, the actualcommand and then a new line for each commandmatches the Llama 2 70B model output.Based on the similar code style, SCATTERED SPIDERlikely relied on an LLM to generate the PowerShell scriptin this activity.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 
2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORTCrowdStrike34Generative AI in Social Engineering
and Information OperationsIn recent years, certain language models have been able to compose fictional stories5 and generate digital 
artwork.6 Since at least mid\-2021, CrowdStrike has frequently reported on alleged research interest in highlydeceptive AI\-fabricated images, audio and video (aka deepfakes) by Russia, China and Iran. Researchersand academics have further speculated that threat actors will almost certainly use generative AI tools in 
information and influence operations in the near future.7These speculations began actualizing in 2023: A Chinese information operations campaign, likely relianton images produced by generative AI (specifically diffusion\-model\-generated images), gained authenticengagement across several prominent social media platforms throughout September. Beyond state\-nexusactors, CrowdStrike also observed a hacktivist group attempting to create a spam tool using generative AI aspart of its efforts to disseminate pro\-Azerbaijan messaging.OutlookGenerative AI has potential for use in numerous fields not likely identified or popularized in mainstream publicdiscourse. AIs continuous development will undoubtedly increase the potency of its potential misuse particularly within the scope of information operations and especially for less digitally literate audiences. Thedegree to which popular generative AI tools can be used maliciously will likely adapt over time as companies,tool owners and governments respond to new developments and perceived misuse.CrowdStrike CAO assesses that generative AI will likely be used for cyber activities in 2024 as the technologycontinues to gain popularity. The team will track exactly how threat actors use this technology, and how thisuse differs from mainstream applications, throughout 2024\. This type of research includes examinations ofboth: The potential that adversaries will use publicly available or open\-source LLMs, which will likely require 
continual adversary navigation around safeguards against malicious or illegal activity (e.g jailbreaking). Adversaries attempts to develop their own models or generative AI tools that require less prompt 
engineering. Notably, the cost of training LLMs can significantly deter their independent, illicitdevelopment. Threat actors attempts to craft and use such models in 2023 frequently amounted to scamsthat created relatively poor outputs and, in many cases, quickly became defunct.5https:apnews.comarticle7f49bd9aa9d1427d8400e40beb9f5ba4

High\-profile, national\-levelelections will also occur in countries or groups involved in, or proximal to, majorgeopolitical conflicts. These include Taiwan, Azerbaijan, India, Pakistan, Iran, Belarus,Russia, Finland, Lithuania and the European Union.2024s potential to transform geopolitics around the globe for the near future willlikely give adversaries numerous opportunities, and a considerable strategic impetus,to target entities involved in electoral processes throughout the coming year.Election TargetingCyber activity targeting elections can range from direct attempts to disrupt electoralprocesses to more indirect efforts to sway voter opinion toward outcomes preferred 
by the adversary.8 The most direct, but least frequent, targeting involves intrusionsagainst the software and hardware used to record, tally, count and transmit votes invoting systems. This form of election interference can range from using computernetwork attacks to intentionally disrupt, degrade or destroy voting systems to usingprivileged access or vulnerabilities to attempt to alter vote counts without detection.Less direct forms of targeted intrusion can involve attempts to compromise, disruptaccess to or leak data from government systems that provide logistical information tovoters, store voter registration data or otherwise support transparent and democraticelection conduct. These targeted intrusion efforts include using DDoS attacks orwebsite defacements against local, municipal, provincial and state governmentsystems, a tactic historically favored by hacktivists seeking to espouse theirviewpoints during tense political moments. Other parties involved in elections such as political candidates, parties, donors and advocacy groups can also betargeted in a variety of ways, including via the use of hack\-and\-leak operationsoften designed to publicly discredit the target.The least direct type of election targeting but almost certainly the mostcommon and typically the most difficult to prevent involves distributing mis\- ordisinformation to electorates before, during and after voting processes in an effortto influence popular opinion.These information operations can take many forms. One common theme involvesattempts to generate disruptive narratives for example, they may undermine publicconfidence in election outcomes, enhance perceptions that specific political partiesor individuals are corrupt, impugn candidates personal character or disseminateinflammatory and polarizing social rhetoric. Other operations may aim to reinforceperspectives that portray the threat actor responsible in a more positive light;for example, as an advocate for specific policy positions beneficial to that entityor representative of cooperation or coexistence rhetoric.8Though this section details the actions of external malicious actors targeting elections, it is worthnoting that ostensibly democratic governments sometimes also use their own domestic security authorities 
to legally restrict the free flow of information during election cycles (e.g internet shutdowns and censorship).CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

Adopting ransomware as its primarymeans of extortion has shifted the scope of the adversarys target profile: MostSCATTERED SPIDER victims in 2023 can be categorized as either reconnaissancetargets or monetization targets. Reconnaissance targets are typically organizationsin the business process outsourcing, customer relationship management, customerexperience, technology and telecom sectors. SCATTERED SPIDER uses intrusionsinto these entities networks to identify data that may prove useful in downstream,third\-party monetization targeting.The adversarys monetization target profile is considerably broader.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly maintainedaccess to HIVE SPIDERs internal infrastructure since July 2022 and has sinceprovided decryption keys to more than 300 worldwide victims, preventingransom payments totaling 130 million USD. No HIVE SPIDER activity has beenobserved since January 2023; however, Hive affiliates have since migrated to otherransomware as a service (RaaS) operations.In February and September 2023, law enforcement issued sanctions againstWIZARD SPIDER members aiming to restrict the named individuals finances, travel,and assets and disrupt the adversarys operations as it worked to circumvent therestrictions.In March 2023, Europol announced the arrest of two suspected core DOPPELSPIDER members. In June 2023, the DOJ announced the arrest of a suspectedBITWISE SPIDER affiliate. In August 2023, the FBI announced a multinationaloperation using a custom payload to send a shutdown command thatremoved MALLARD SPIDERs QakBot malware from more than 700,000 hosts andseized a significant amount of cryptocurrency.

43Data Theft and Extortion OptimizationSince 2019, BGH adversaries have threatened to publish stolen data on DLSs as 
a secondary extortion means in concert with deploying ransomware.12 In 2023,adversaries continued to invent exploitation methods to steal victim data andincrease pressure on victims, with many including GRACEFUL SPIDER andMASKED SPIDER adopting data theft as their sole means of extortion.GRACEFUL SPIDER was the most prolific data theft and extortion actor in 2023\.The adversary exploited zero\-day vulnerabilities in file\-transfer applicationsGoAnywhere Managed File Transfer and MOVEit Transfer as well as ITmanagement software SysAid On\-Premise. GRACEFUL SPIDERs Clop ransomwaredeployment within the scope of these campaigns was not observed, although theadversary exfiltrated and published data to its DLS that belonged to more than380 victim organizations. To allow broader audience access to leaks, GRACEFULSPIDER also published victim data on clearweb domains, a technique first used byan ALPHA SPIDER affiliate in 2022\.BGH adversaries have historically and indiscriminately exfiltrated and publishedstolen victim data. In 2023, these threat actors demonstrated greater focus onstolen data in efforts to maximize pressure on victims, as shown by the following: Publishing victim Domain Admin credentials and system IP addresses on theBlack Basta RaaS DLS. This data could be leveraged by distinct threat actors totarget victim organizations. Creating separate victim posts for third\-party organizations whose data was 
identified in the victim network but were not subjected to compromises. Multiple RaaS affiliates compromised mental and physical healthcare entities 
and highlighted their access to and provided previews of sensitive dataand records, including patient photos, in DLS posts. VICE SPIDER continued to use a PS script to automate data exfiltrationbut customized the script to search for directory and filenames containing 
strings such as \*violence \*abuse \*Theft \*Stealing 
\*humiliation \*harassment\* and \*death likely to identify data thatposed a high potential for embarrassing victim organizations.Many adversaries, including GRACEFUL SPIDER and MASKED SPIDER, havestruggled with cryptographic flaws in their ransomware that enable trivialdecryption under specific conditions. In contrast, data theft and extortion offerBGH actors an easier route to monetization, and many simply steal data from asingle host or public\-facing application. CrowdStrike CAO assesses that BGHadversaries will likely continue to become more targeted in their pursuit of datawith a high potential for embarrassing victims.12https:www.crowdstrike.comblogdouble\-trouble\-ransomware\-data\-leak\-extortion\-part\-1CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

This increase is driven by various factors,including GRACEFUL SPIDERs zero\-day exploitation campaigns, BGH adversariescontinued targeting of unmanaged devices such as edge gateway devicesfor initial access and targeting VMware ESXi for encryption and an increasingnumber of adversaries naming victims following data theft incidents that did notinclude ransomware deployment.Though CrowdStrike CAO assesses that ransomware will highly likely remainthe primary extortion method through 2024, BGH adversaries will increasinglyemphasize stolen\-data exploitation as a means to pressure victims into payment.This is particularly true as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules 
impact major cybersecurity incident disclosures.13SCATTERED SPIDERs Alphv ransomware underscored the effectiveness ofextortion as a tactic throughout 2023\. Though SCATTERED SPIDER previouslymonetized campaigns through cryptocurrency theft and SIM swaps, ransomwareis a more opportunistic tactic, enabling the adversary to broaden its targetscope. Barring any successful law enforcement activity targeting the adversary,SCATTERED SPIDER will highly likely remain a critical threat to high\-revenueprivate sector entities in 2024, particularly those based in Europe and NorthAmerica.Coordinated international law enforcement operations targeted BGH actors in2023\. These included adversary personnel arrests, technical action againstvarious capabilities, cryptocurrency seizure and sanctioning of named individuals.The disruption of HIVE SPIDERs Hive RaaS and MALLARD SPIDERs enabling QakBotmalware left voids that were quickly filled by competing RaaS and malware as aservice (MaaS) actors, demonstrating the eCrime ecosystems resilience againsttakedowns that do not arrest the individuals behind the operations.13https:www.sec.govnewspress\-release2023\-139CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 
45eCRIME ENABLERSMalware Delivery Trends Following 
Mark\-of\-the\-Web Patch on ISO FilesAdversaries in 2023 experimented with malware delivery methods that do notrely on macros or ISO files, following a sharp increase in ISO files being used formalware delivery and a subsequent patch by Microsoft for a Mark\-of\-the\-Webbypass vulnerability in container files in 2022\.The number of malware campaigns using malicious OneNote files for initial 
access rose significantly14 between late December 2022 and March 2023, withthe techniques earliest adopters including criminals distributing informationstealers and commodity malware. By mid\-January 2023, large\-scale malwaredistributors such as LUNAR SPIDER, HONEY SPIDER and MALLARD SPIDER beganusing OneNote files as a primary malware distribution method. In March 2023,Microsoft announced a change that would prevent file types commonly abused by 
adversaries from being embedded in OneNote files.15 Following the announcement,the popularity of OneNote files within adversary campaigns rapidly declined.Though no one technique has emerged as a front\-runner to replace OneNote files,adversaries continue to experiment with malware delivery methods. Adversariessuch as LUNAR SPIDER, APOTHECARY SPIDER and HERMIT SPIDER haveconsistently used malvertising and search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning.Adversaries reliant on spam campaigns use multiple techniques and file types todeliver malware. Several adversaries have used PDF files containing links to fileshosted on external URLs as well as HTML smuggling. More novel techniqueshave included using WebDAV files to distribute payloads. Toward the end of2023, multiple malware families were distributed in new lures containing fakebrowser updates.Malvertising and SEO PoisoningMalvertising is a technique in which threat actors create malicious advertisementsto facilitate criminal activity. Adversaries use SEO poisoning to falsely promotemalicious websites to higher ranks in search engine results. Similar to malvertising,SEO poisoning relies on users believing the results closest to the top of a searchresult are the most credible.Throughout 2023, adversaries such as LUNAR SPIDER regularly abused Googleadvertisements to ensure their malicious ads appeared at the top of search resultpages.

All observedmacOS malware families are information stealers capable of harvestingstored passwords, cookies and cryptocurrency wallets.AMOS customers have distributed these tools via SEO poisoning as well asfake play\-to\-earn games and illegitimate job advertisements. MacOS Stealercustomers, including BITWISE SPIDER, ROYAL SPIDER and ALPHA SPIDERransomware affiliates, have praised the stealer. Although COOKIE SPIDERstated that a portion of its current 50 to 100 customers include BITWISESPIDER and ALPHA SPIDER affiliates, CrowdStrike CAO cannot presentlyverify this claim.macOS stealers gained traction in the eCrime ecosystem throughout2023 due to their ability to enable opportunistic actors and ransomwareaffiliates during criminal operations. Since the majority of informationstealers typically target Windows\-based OSs, the increasing number ofmacOS stealers in the eCrime ecosystem has expanded eCrime profitopportunities.Access Brokers Persistently Provide

Furthermore, eCrimeenablers regularly copy successful tactics used by other criminal actors, as madeevident by the increase of OneNote files for malware delivery.eCrime enablers will highly likely continue to innovate and offer new products oncriminal marketplaces in 2024\. This assessment is made with high confidencebased on historical trends in the eCrime ecosystem. Malware delivery trends willlikely continue to fluctuate, with SEO poisoning and malvertising remaining popularand spam\-reliant adversaries proceeding to regularly experiment with differentmethods. This assessment is made with high confidence based on malwaredelivery trends observed since the end of 2022\.The access broker threat shows no immediate sign of abating. These threat actorswill almost certainly facilitate intrusions into various organizations worldwidethroughout 2024 using a mixture of established TTPs alongside commodity andcustom tooling.TARGETED eCRIMEAdversaries Continue Legitimate 
RMM Tool UseThroughout 2023, multiple targeted eCrime adversaries particularly CHEF SPIDER, DISTANT SPIDER and SOLARSPIDER heavily used legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools.Starting in March 2023, CHEF SPIDER adopted sophisticated social engineering tactics to direct victims to downloadInno Setup and ClickOnce installers for RMM tool ConnectWise ScreenConnect. Though CHEF SPIDER has historicallytargeted point\-of\-sale systems in the hospitality sector by compromising internet\-facing servers, the adversary graduallyshifted to targeting U.Sbased hospitality sector service providers, financial service providers and digital marketing firmsthroughout 2023\.In 2023, DISTANT SPIDER which universally relies on ConnectWise ScreenConnect continued deploying MSIinstallers (aka Windows Installers) for this legitimate RMM tool after exploiting vulnerable internet\-facing servers withinvictim environments. In September 2023, an earlier DISTANT SPIDER ConnectWise ScreenConnect intrusion likelyenabled an ALPHA SPIDER affiliate to exfiltrate data and demand a ransom from a victim.In June 2023, SOLAR SPIDER likely used phishing emails to direct victims to download a ZIP archive hosted on GitHub.This archive contained a loader that abuses DLL search\-order hijacking to run the legitimate RMM Remote ManagementSystem tool.

Fsociety tools typically consist ofa set of scripts that download and execute an intermediate .NET payload thatsubsequently loads a final RAT payload in memory. Throughout 2023, ROBOTSPIDER continued to update the Fsociety crypter to improve obfuscation and addcapabilities. Generally, infection chains leveraging Fsociety culminated in commodityRATs such as njRAT Lime.ODYSSEY SPIDER, which is likely based in Brazil, uses ROBOT SPIDERs Fsocietycrypter service along with other commodity crypters and RATs. ODYSSEYSPIDER predominantly focuses on the travel and hospitality sectors in LATAM andSoutheastern Europe, specifically aiming to monetize payment card details enteredduring travel\-related booking processes. However, in Q3 2023, the adversarybegan targeting numerous other sectors and regions, likely while leveraging localtax return periods.SQUAB SPIDER primarily targets financial institutions, particularly but notexclusively those based in Mexico. The adversary achieves initial access byexploiting web servers to deploy a wide set of webshells. From there, threatactors rely on passive BLUEAGAVE bind shells or simple listeners to enable lateralmovement through a network and to generally avoid conventional C2 traffic.SQUAB SPIDER likely attempts to steal transaction\-related data from victims.OutlookThough opportunistic BGH campaigns remain the primary eCrime threat acrossall sectors, a smaller eCrime actor subset will likely continue targeted eCrimecampaigns seeking to steal payment card\- or transaction\-related data fromvictims. As with the BGH ecosystem, legitimate RMM tools will likely remainpopular among targeted eCrime operations due to their widespread use withinnormal business processes.

CrowdStrike52ConclusionOver the course of 2023, CrowdStrike CAO observed adversaries acrossthe targeted intrusion, eCrime and hacktivist landscapes operating withunprecedented stealth. The ability to operate undetected remains paramount formalicious actors, and todays sophisticated cybercriminals continue to discovernew methods to increase effectiveness, enhance operations and achieveobjectives.eCrime remained a 2023 threat landscape cornerstone, with BGH adversariesSCATTERED SPIDER and GRACEFUL SPIDER accounting for most activity.CrowdStrike CAO assesses BGH will continue to pose the dominant threat withinthe eCrime landscape in 2024\. This assessment is made with high confidencebased on the continued success of these operations, as observed in the 76%growth in DLS posts in 2023\. Trends likely to be observed in 2024 in support ofBGH operations include ransomware\-free data leak operations and an increase incloud\-conscious operations.The number of cloud\-conscious threat actors continued to grow in 2023 asin 2022 and will highly likely continue to grow in 2024\. Adversaries are highlymotivated to invest in and use cloud and other new technologies, such asgenerative AI, to increase the efficiency and success of their operations. Cloud\-aware adversaries will look to detect, enumerate and navigate cloud environmentsto harvest valuable proprietary information from Microsoft 365, SharePoint andcode repositories. They will use this information in ongoing operations and ransomnegotiations or simply sell it to other eCrime adversaries.Financially motivated adversaries also increasingly realized the benefits ofdedicated relationships in 2023 and were likely able to increase resultingoperational success rates. Access brokers and RaaS actors will likely continueto forge dedicated relationships in 2024\. The coming year will also likely includeenhancements in social engineering effectiveness, MFA bypass and third\-partyprovider targeting in efforts to leverage a single larger point of access.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORTCrowdStrike53High\-profile geopolitical conflicts namely the Russia\-Ukraine and Israel\-Hamasconflicts generated significant targeted intrusion and hacktivist cyber activity in2023, particularly for Iran\-nexus and Russia\-nexus adversaries. In 2024, these andother high\-profile conflicts will remain as significant hacktivism drivers.Beyond cyber activity related to the Israel\-Hamas conflict, Iran\-nexus adversariesremained consistent in targeting telecom organizations, a trend likely to continuein 2024\. Russia\-nexus adversaries also persisted in their targeting of Ukraine,NATO members and partner countries. They will almost certainly continue toconduct intelligence collection operations and IO in these geographies in 2024\.CrowdStrike CAO graduated several activity clusters to named adversariesin 2023, including the first\-ever Egypt\-nexus adversary, WATCHFUL SPHINX.Consistent with previous assessments, CrowdStrike CAO expects the majority ofestablished adversaries and activity clusters to continue to expand or update theircapabilities in 2024\. Fewer adversaries and activity clusters around the world arelikely to expand their assessed target scope; rather, they will likely continue tofocus on historical and predominantly regional target sets.Within the vulnerability threat landscape, CrowdStrike CAO assesses that several2023 trends namely, edge device and EOL product targeting will persist in2024\. eCrime threat actors remained the primary threat to most mobile users in2023 and will likely continue as such in 2024\. Targeted intrusion actors will alsoalmost certainly continue to target mobile devices, with increases in platformand device security causing less sophisticated adversaries to struggle to operatesuccessfully in that space.With the creation of Counter Adversary Operations, CrowdStrike remains steadfastin its mission to stop breaches.

To counter these threats, it is essential to implement phishing\-resistant multifactorengineering and implement technology that can detect and correlate threats across identity,endpoint and cloud environments. Cross\-domain visibility and enforcement enables securityteams to detect lateral movement, get full attack path visibility and hunt for malicious useof legitimate tools. Addressing sophisticated access methods such as SIM swapping,MFA bypass and the theft of API keys, session cookies and Kerberos tickets requiresproactive and continuous hunting for malicious behavior.23Prioritize cloud\-native application 
protection platforms (CNAPPs)Cloud adoption is exploding as companies realize the potential for innovation andbusiness agility that the cloud offers. Due to this growth, the cloud is rapidly becoming amajor battleground for cyberattacks. Businesses need full cloud visibility, including intoapplications and APIs, to eliminate misconfigurations, vulnerabilities and other security threats.CNAPPs are critical: Cloud security tools shouldnt exist in isolation, and CNAPPs provide aunified platform that simplifies monitoring, detecting and acting on potential cloud securitythreats and vulnerabilities. Select a CNAPP that includes pre\-runtime protection, runtimeprotection and agentless technology to help you discover and map your apps and APIs runningin production, showing you all attack surfaces, threats and critical business risks.Gain visibility across the most critical 
areas of enterprise riskAdversaries often use valid credentials to access cloud\-facing victim environments and thenuse legitimate tools to execute their attack, making it difficult for defenders to differentiatebetween normal user activity and a breach. To identify this type of attack, you need tounderstand the relationship between identity, cloud, endpoint and data protection telemetry,which may be in separate systems. In fact, the average enterprise uses 45\+ security tools,creating data silos and gaps in visibility. By consolidating into a unified security platform withAI capabilities, organizations have complete visibility in one place and can easily control theiroperations. With a consolidated security platform, organizations save time and money and canquickly and confidently discover, identify and stop breaches.CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
