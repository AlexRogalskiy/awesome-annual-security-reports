European Unions new artificial intelligence law2 was designed to bridge the gap between concerned intellectual 
property creators and AI providers, the measure may actually embolden copyright holders to go to court.3 Additional

B. Insurance helps to drive Intangible Asset Safety
Insurance mandates superior risk management practices 
and facilitates lower Total Cost of Risk17 for todays 
evolving intangible assets. Increased safety resilience in 
artificial intelligence, cyber\-related productsservices, 
intellectual property and evolving technology digital 
assetsservices might be rewarded with:Superior insurance coverage and lower premium 
options, which protects organizations balance
sheets against catastrophic losses;Third party, independent underwriters review

and Fees (insurance buyers often focus too much on premium and not enough on 
comprehensive customized and in\-context coverage and vetting reliable Insurers) 
whereby Risk Financing Costs include all insurance premiums and attendant 
costs; Direct Costs of Losses includes deductibles and claims that are anticipated 
and funded inside the organizations risk financing program (e.g captive, 
deductible, or self\-insurance programs); Indirect Loss Costs are a corresponding 
expense that is unfunded and, in some cases, unanticipated; Administrative Costs 
include claims management, risk control, and all other project costs such as 
data analytics; Taxes and fees are the various state taxes attached to insurance 
placements and are paid to governmental and regulatory bodies (e.g state surplus 
lines or admission fees).

Introduction
C. Better Decisions for Intangible Asset Investmentand Protection
The most valuable organizations make risk management 
cost\-benefit decisions predicated upon quantifiable, 
objective, fact\-based data. The return on intangible 
assets investment is unclear24\. The estimated ROI 
magnitude range is enormous25\. A February 2024 
report states that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seeks to 
raise up to $7 trillion, which had many tech\-industry 
observers raising eyebrows. The amount easily exceeds 
the market cap of any companyincluding Microsoft, 
which recently hit $3\.1 trillion and surged past Apple as 
Americas most valuable company.26 
Similarly, the range of estimates regarding frequency 
and severity of potential losses from intangible assets 
is enormous27\. The insurance industry typically builds 
actuarial loss models based on decades of data.28 
24 After OpenAI launched Sora a text\-to\-video AI model that converts text into a 
high\-quality video up to a minute long a video of Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann 
LeCun went viral in which he said at Davos 2024 that he believes: The future of
AI is not generative.

number,
 Geoffrey Hinton, godfather of AI Will Digital Intelligence Replace 
Biological Intelligence.

28 Will AI Destroy the World? If Not, How Will It Affect Insurance? \- Todays General 
Counsel (todaysgeneralcounsel.com)
However, due to the dynamic and fluid nature of 
intangible assets, we will never have decades worth 
of static intangible assets and risks data. Therefore, 
retain risk versus transfer risk decisions require fresh 
thinking.29 Compliance with accepted industry standards 
should be the minimum baseline.30

29 The most calamitous failures of prediction usually have a lot in common. We focus 
on those signals that tell a story about the world as we would like it to be, not how 
it really is. We ignore the risks that are hardest to measure, even when they pose 
the greatest threats to our well\-being. We make approximations and assumptions 
about the world that are much cruder than we realize. We abhor uncertainty, even 
when it is an irreducible part of the problem we are trying to solve.

are beyond the scope of this study, such as goodwill, brand equity, ESG
(aon\-2023\-impact\-report.pdf), DE \& I, licensing, and (except as included within 
the calculation of trade secrets), customer lists and research and development. 
An intangible asset is identifiable when it is capable of being separated and sold, 
transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or together with 
a related contract; or arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of 
whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other 
rights and obligations.
Large, complex, global organizations 
that execute a data and analytics\-based 
enterprise risk management process are 
better positioned to maximize value and 
mitigate risks from their intangible assets.

Introduction
How can organizations make better decisions regarding 
allocation of their finite resources to protect against 
tangible and intangible perils? At its most basic, 
insurance is a financial instrument a way to manage 
the cost of future risk. Its pretty simple. On the one 
hand, you can self\-insure risk, holding onto it yourself 
and bearing the full cost of a loss (unless you have 
transferred it contractually in an indemnity agreement 
with a counterparty). Or you can pay an insurance 
company a premium to take some or all of that risk from 
you. The biggest challenges to address intangible assets 
risks are identificationquantification of the exposures 
and then taking a different, proactive mindset to 
mitigate such risks. 
For example, there are recent studies that set forth 
the relative ROI of various cyber risk management 
mechanisms. Allocating cyber resiliency resources 
based on their relative increasedecrease effect on 
expected losses is a better decision\-making mindset.

Given the intersection of tangible and intangible assets 
in many instances with the advent of the Internet of 
Things5G,34 growth of AI robotics, metaverseWeb 3\.0,35 
virtual reality gaming, quantum computing, blockchain,36 
etc. it is difficult to separate the actuarial modelling of 
intangible and tangible risks but it is necessary and 
useful. For instance, the tangible assets of Property,

insured three times greater (60 percent vs 19 percent) 
than information assets.37
Cyberattacks, especially ransomware38 are surging39

Introduction
Generative AI, which creates material such as images, 
music and text, results in perils such as intellectual 
property infringement,41 hallucinations,42 security
privacy breaches43 and bias44 garnering most of the 
litigation news. However, some developing AI products, 
such as AI robots, face perils that are different from 
content misinformation, such as mistakes that can lead 
to bodily injury andor tangible property damage. AI 
raises particular risk transfer challenges because AI 
exposures may implicate potential losses that do not fit 
neatly in to existing insurance buckets.45 Courts may 
struggle to extend or limit existing tortcase, statutory 
and contract law with respect to AI. Where there are 
multiple AI providers, users, vendors, distributors, 
customers and others in the supply chain,
46 allocation
of liability looms large.

Furthermore, most traditional insurance policies do not 
explicitly address AI\-related risks. Insureds should clarify 
the scope of coverage and potential exclusions. The 
silent cyber cases, whereby historical property, crime, 
and general liability policies did not affirmatively cover 
or exclude cyber perils, resulted in extensive litigation 
between insurance companies and insureds.

one of three ways:Affirmative coverage47Specific exclusions48Silent,

Introduction
Risk management typically considers frequency and 
severity of perils. With respect to intangible assets 
(especially artificial intelligence and cyber), we should 
add velocity of evolving risk profiles. Organizations 
must proactively address intangible risks through 
tailored insurance policies that align with their unique 
circumstances.51 As the intangible assets landscape 
continues to evolve, a collaborative effort between 
stakeholders,
52 led by legal counsel, risk management, 
financetreasury, business units, information technology, 
and compliance \- and mandated by management \- 
is crucial to help ensure that the potential perils of 
intangible assets are effectively managed and mitigated.
Interestingly, the S\&P companies that cited AI on Q4 
2023 earnings calls have seen a better average stock 
price performance over the past 12 months compared to 
the S\&P 500 companies that did not.53
51Note that procuring a robust cyber insurance program could be a consideration 
in determining whether a cyber incident is material for purposes of the new 
SEC four day mandatory disclosure rule (Aon \| Financial Services Group \- SEC 
Sharpens Focus on Cybersecurity with New Disclosure Rule). For instance, assume 
that two organizations in the same industry, geography and revenue band suffer an 
identical cyber incident \= $25 million in potential losses each. Company A has a 
$50 million limits cyber insurance program and Company B declined to purchase 
cyber insurance due to budget cuts (and Company B does not have any other 
insurance policy that addresses the loss). There is an argument that Company 
A may not be required to disclose the cyber incident as material (because it is 
protected against the loss by its cyber insurance policy) while Company B not 
only has to disclose the incident within 4 days, but will also suffer the uninsured 
$25 million hit to its balance sheet. (Why Private Companies Should Pay Attention 
to the SECs New Cybersecurity Disclosure Rules (cosecure.com)

Most organizations (67 percent of respondents) use 
or intend to use (19 percent) artificial intelligence (AI) 
products or services. There is growing interest in 
adopting AI to strengthen their organizations security 
posture. According to a recent Ponemon Institute study, 
AI improves IT security staffs productivity and the ability 
to detect previously undetectable threats.
54 Sixty\-four 
percent of respondents say their organizations use or 
plan to use (21 percent) cryptocurrency or non\-fungible 
token assets.The Valuation of PP\&E, Information Assets and Probable 
Maximum Loss (PML)
The value of Information Assets Probable Maximum 
Loss (PML)55 is higher than PP\&E. Organizations 
estimate the average PML resulting from stolen or 
destroyed information at approximately $1,155 million. 
In contrast, the average value of the largest loss that 
could result from damage or total destruction of PP\&E 
is approximately $846 million. Business disruption has 
a greater impact on information assets ($324 million)56 
than on PP\&E ($144 million). 
The value of information assets is higher than tangible 
asset values. The average total value of information 
assets is $1,239 million, which is slightly higher thanthe 
average total value of PP\&E, which is approximately 
$1,088 million for the organizations represented in this 
research. 
The likelihood of a loss is higher for information assets 
than for PP\&E. Organizations estimate the likelihood 
that they will sustain a loss relating to information 
assets totaling no more than 50 percent of PML over the 
next 12 months at 5 percent and 100 percent of PML 
at 3 percent. The likelihood of a loss relating to PP\&E 
totaling no more than 50 percent of PML over the next 
12 months is an average of 2 percent and at 100 percent 
of PML it is 0\.55 percent.
Insurance coverage is higher for tangible assets (PP\&E) 
than for intangible assets (information assets). On 
average, approximately 60 percent of PP\&E assets are 
covered by insurance and approximately 32 percent 
of PP\&E are self\-insured. While the likelihood of a loss 
is higher for information assets than for PP\&E, only 
an average of 19 percent of information assets are 
covered by insurance, while self\-insurance is higher for 
information assets at 58 percent.
Thirty percent of respondents believe no disclosure 
of a material loss to information assets not covered by 
insurance is required. This is a stunning data point given 
that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions 
new Form 8\-K rules for reporting material cybersecurity 
incidents took effect (other than for smaller reporting 
companies) December 18, 2024\.
57 In contrast, only 
14 percent of respondents believe no disclosure of a 
material loss to PP\&E assets not covered by insurance
is required. 
Forty\-two percent of respondents say their organizations 
would disclose a material loss to information assets and 
PP\&E in a footnote in the financial statements. Twenty\-
one percent of respondents would disclose a material 
loss to PP\&E as a contingent liability on the balance 
sheet (FASB 5\) and only 13 percent would disclose 
a material loss to information assets as a contingent

55 Probable Maximum Loss (PML) is defined as the value of the largest loss that could result from a disaster, assuming the normal functioning of passive protective features
(i.e firewalls, nonflammable materials, etc.) and proper functioning of most (perhaps not all) active suppression systems (i.e sprinklers). 
56 While the survey results suggest Probable Maximum Loss at approximately $324 million, a growing number of organizations are using Risk Decision Platform Analysis and Cyber 
Modeling to suggest potential losses in excess of $500 million to over $1 billion and are seeking cyber insurance limit premium quotes and policy terms for such amounts.

Introduction
Cyber Risk Exposure Increases 
Fifty\-six percent of organizations had a material58 or 
significantly disruptive security exploit or data breach 
one or more times in the past 24 months. The average 
total financial impact of these incidents was $5 million.59 
Sixty\-six percent of these respondents say the incident 
increased their companys concerns over cyber liability. 
Data breaches and security exploitations caused by 
negligence or mistakes increases significantly. The 
most frequent type of incident was one that was caused 
by negligence or mistakes that resulted in the loss 
of business confidential information (53 percent of 
respondents). Fifty percent of respondents say it was a 
cyberattack that caused a disruption to business and IT 
operations. Forty\-seven percent of respondents say a 
system or business process failure caused disruption to 
business operations.
More organizations are becoming aware of the economic 
and legal consequences from an international data 
breach or security exploit. Eighty\-nine percent of 
respondents are either fully (41 percent) or somewhat 
aware (48 percent) of the consequences that could result 
from a data breach or security exploit in other countries 
in which their company operates. Only 11 percent of 
respondents say they are not aware of the consequences, 
a significant decline from 20 percent in 2017\.60
The use of third parties to assess cyber risk has 
declined. To determine the cyber risk to their company, 
27 percent of respondents say the company hired a third 
party to conduct an assessment or audit, a decrease 
from 33 percent. However, formal internal assessments 
are slowly increasing (from 15 percent in 2015 to 25 
percent of respondents this year). Twenty\-two percent 
of respondents say their organizations did an informal 
(ad hoc) internal assessment. Only 18 percent of 
respondents say it was based on intuition or gut feel.
Organizations exposure to cyber risk is increasing. 
While organizations are predicting that their cyber risk 
exposure will increase, 32 percent of respondents say 
there is no plan to purchase standalone cyber insurance. 
Sixty\-nine percent of respondents believe their companys 
exposure to cyber risk will increase and 21 percent of 
respondents say it will stay the same. Only 10 percent
of respondents expect it to actually decrease.
Only 44 percent of respondents are prepared for a 
cyber or IP black swan. A black swan is an event that 
is an outlier as it lies outside the realm of regular 
expectations. According to the research, 44 percent of 
respondents say ab external cyber andor intellectual 
property incident can become a Black Swan for the firm.61
58 In the context of this study, the term materiality takes into consideration monies expended for first\-party losses, potential third\-party liabilities, value of lost time, litigation costs, 
reputation damages and revenue losses. This term is broader than materiality as defined by GAAP and SEC requirements.
59 This included all costs, including out\-of\-pocket expenditures such as consultant and legal fees, indirect business costs such as productivity losses, diminished revenues, legal 
actions, customer turnover and reputational damages.

Introduction
The Use of Cyber Insurance to Mitigate the Financial 
Consequences of Data Breaches and Security Exploits.62
Cyber liability is a top 10 business risk. However,
70 percent of respondents say their organizations are
still not purchasing standalone cyber insurance coverage. 
The average limit for those organizations purchasing 
cyber insurance is $17 million.
More than half of respondents (53 percent) say it was 
error and negligence that was the root cause of their 
data breach or security exploit, yet only 33 percent of 
respondents say their insurance covers these types
of incidents. Seventy\-eight percent of respondents
say it covers external attacks by cyber criminals and
76 percent of respondents say it was malicious or 
criminal insiders.
Few cyber insurance policies cover ransomware 
payments and costs to recover from the attack.
The top three costs are forensics and investigative 
costs, replacement of lost or damaged equipment and 
notification costs to data breach victims, 68 percent,
62 percent and 59 percent of respondents respectively). 
Only 34 percent of respondents say their insurance 
reimburse costs related to ransomware.

Introduction
Vulnerability of IP Assets
As a complement to a cyber risk policy, few 
organizations have a trade secret theft insurance policy 
andor an intellectual property liability policy.
Only 35 percent of respondents say they have a trade 
secret theft insurance policy and a similar percentage
of respondents (34 percent) have an intellectual 
property liability policy. 
Most organizations insurance does not cover all 
consequences of an IP event. Only 32 percent of 
respondents say it covers an allegation that their 
company is infringing third\-party IP rights. Thirty\-six 
percent of respondents report that their policy covers a 
challenge to their companys IP assets while 33 percent 
of respondents say it covers third\-party infringement
of their companys IP assets. One\-third of respondents
(33 percent) say the policy does not cover IP events.
63
The percentage of respondents who say their 
organizations have a strategy to manage IP risks 
increases. Sixty\-one percent of respondents say their 
enterprise risk management activities include risks 
to their IP, a significant increase from 53 percent of 
respondents in 2022\.
IP security exploits involving patents has increased 
significantly. In the past two years, 50 percent of 
respondents say their company experienced a
material IP event.64 The IP material event can be best 
described as an infringement of company rights
(37 percent of respondents), challenge to company 
rights (33 percent of respondents) or an allegation of
an organizations infringement of third\-party rights
(30 percent of respondents).
Most of these incidents involved trade secrets
(36 percent of respondents). However, exploits
involving patent rights increased from 25 percent of 
respondents to 32 percent of respondents.
Organizations represented in this research estimate 
that the average total value of their IP assets such as 
trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and 
know\-how is $600 million. An average of 47 percent
of organizations total assets are IP assets.
While most organizations do not have specific IP 
insurance policies, there is significant interest in 
purchasing them. Sixty\-four percent of respondents 
are very interested or interested in purchasing a trade 
secret insurance policy and 62 percent say their 
organizations would purchase an intellectual property 
liability policy.
63 A detailed review of insurance policies indicates that IP coverage is much lower than survey responses reflect especially for patent infringement and trade secrets theft, which 
detailed reviews show less than 5% of organizations have insurance coverage for trade secrets or patents.
64 IP event includes challenge to company rights, infringement of company rights,
 and allegation of company infringement of third\-party rights pursuant to Question 25c in the 
Appendix hereto.

This report features the consolidated findings of all 
regions in this research. Separate reports will be created 
for the North America, EMEA, Asia\-Pac and LATAM 
regions. The complete global consolidated audited 
findings are presented in the Appendix of this report.
All respondents are familiar with the cyber risks facing 
their company. In the context of this research, cyber risk 
means any risk of financial loss, disruption or damage 
to the reputation of an organization from some sort of 
failure of its information technology systems.66 We have 
organized the report according to the following topics:The Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(PP\&E), Information Assets and Probable Maximum 
Loss (PML)Cyber Risk Exposures IncreaseThe Use of Cyber Insurance to Mitigate the
Financial Consequences of Data Breaches and 
Security ExploitsThe Vulnerability of IP Assets
The Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment (PP\&E), 
Information Assets and Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
Organizations continue to value information assets 
slightly higher than they do PP\&E. According to Figure 1,
on average, the total value of PP\&E, including all fixed 
assets plus SCADA and industrial control systems is 
66 Source: Institute of Risk Management
approximately $1,088 million for the organizations 
represented in this research. The average total value
of information assets, which includes customer records, 
employee records, financial reports, analytical data, 
source code, models, methods and other intellectual 
properties, is slightly higher, at $1,239 million.

The value of PML is higher for information assets than
for PP\&E. Organizations estimate the average PML 
resulting from the theft or destruction of information 
assets at approximately $1,155 million, according 
to Figure 2\. This assumes the normal functioning of 
passive protective cybersecurity solutions such as 
perimeter controls, data loss prevention tools, data 
encryption, identity and access management systems 
and more. 
In contrast, the value of the largest loss that could result 
from damage or total destruction of PP\&E is, on average, 
approximately $846 million. This also assumes the
normal functioning of passive protective features such as
firewalls, nonflammable materials, proper functioning of 
active suppression systems, fire sprinklers, raised flooring 
and more.

The likelihood of a loss is higher for information assets 
than for PP\&E. Organizations estimate the likelihood 
that they will sustain a loss relating to information assets 
totaling no more than 50 percent of PML over the next 
12 months at 5 percent and 100 percent of PML at
3 percent, as shown in Figure 4\. The likelihood of a loss 
relating to PP\&E totaling no more than 50 percent of 
PML over the next 12 months is an average of 2 percent 
and at 100 percent of PML it is 0\.55 percent.

There is a significant difference between the insurance 
coverage of PP\&E and information assets. On average, 
approximately 60 percent of PP\&E assets are covered 
by insurance and approximately 32 percent of PP\&E 
assets are self\-insured (Figure 5\). Only an average of
19 percent of information assets are covered by 
insurance. Self\-insurance is higher for information 
assets at 58 percent.

insurance is required. In contrast, only 14 percent of
respondents say no disclosure is necessary for a 
material loss to PP\&E assets not covered by insurance
is required. Figure 6 focuses on how organizations 
would disclose a material loss. Forty\-two percent of 
respondents say their company would disclose a material 
loss to PP\&E and information assets not covered by 
insurance in the footnotes of its financial statements. 
Twenty\-one percent of respondents say their 
organizations would disclose a material loss to PP\&E 
as a contingent liability on the balance sheet (FASB 5\). 
Thirteen percent of respondents say an information
loss would be reported as a contingent liability.

The use of third parties to assess cyber risk has declined. 
According to Figure 10, to determine the cyber risk 
to their company, 27 percent of respondents say the 
company hired a third party to conduct an assessment 
or audit. However, formal internal assessments is slowly 
increasing (25 percent of respondents). Twenty\-two 
percent of respondents say their organizations did an 
informal (ad hoc) internal assessment. Only 18 percent 
of respondents say it was based on intuition or gut feel.

Organizations exposure to cyber risk is increasing. 
While organizations are predicting that their cyber 
risk exposure will increase, 32 percent of respondents 
say there is no plan to purchase standalone cyber 
insurance. As the data in Figure 12 show, 69 percent of 
respondents believe their companys exposure to cyber 
risk will increase and 21 percent of respondents say 
it will stay the same. Only 10 percent of respondents 
expect it to actually decrease.

Most organizations are postponing the purchase of 
a standalone cyber insurance. Thirty\-two percent of 
respondents say their organizations have no plans
to purchase a standalone cyber insurance policy.
Only 18 percent of respondents say their company will
purchase standalone cyber insurance policy in the
next 12 months. Half of respondents (50 percent)
say they will purchase a standalone cyber insurance
policy in the next 24 months (28 percent) or more
than 24 months (22 percent). 
According to Figure 13, the main reasons for not 
purchasing a standalone cyber security insurance
policy are: coverage is inadequate based on their 
exposure (38 percent of respondents), premiums are
too expensive (37 percent of respondents) and there
are too many exclusions, restrictions and uninsurable 
risks (29 percent of respondents).

Most organizations are not preparing for a Black Swan 
event as part of their enterprise risk management 
approach, although 44 percent of respondents say 
their organizations had an external cyber or IP incident 
that became such an event. A Black Swan is an event 
that is an outlier as it lies outside the realm of regular 
expectations.
68 As shown in Figure 14, while 44 percent 
of respondents say an external cyber and intellectual 
property incident has become a Black Swan event for 
their organizations, only 44 percent of respondents say 
preparation for such an event is part of their enterprise 
risk management approach.

68 A black swan is an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected 
of a situation and has potentially severe consequences, such as the COVID\-19 
pandemic. Black swan events are characterized by their extreme rarity, their severe 
impact, and the widespread insistence they were obvious in hindsight.
69 Due to their severe impact, black swans should be considered by the board of 
directors. Is cyber risk a D\&O risk? (ethicalboardroom.com). While data on gray 
swan events are lacking, preparation is still possible to anticipate and combat 
these relatively rare but significantly risky events.Black and Grey Swans: 5 Ways

Only 30 percent of respondents say their organizations 
have cyber insurance included within a Technology 
Errors or Omission or similar policy, not including 
Property, General Liability or Crime policy and 
responded to the questions in this section.
Since 2017, fewer organizations believe their cyber 
insurance coverage is sufficient. Despite the extent
of cyber risk, which exceeds that of PP\&E risk, only
30 percent of respondents say their organizations
currently have cyber insurance coverage with an 
average limit of $17 million. 
As Figure 15 reveals, 56 percent of these respondents 
believe their insurance is sufficient with respect to 
coverage terms and conditions, exclusions, retentions, 
limits and insurance carrier financial security,
a significant decline from 63 percent in 2017\.70

Few cyber insurance providers are covering ransomware 
payments and costs to recover from the attack. Figure 18 
lists the various reimbursements and services insurance 
organizations offer. The top three are forensics and 
investigative costs, replacement of lost or damaged 
equipment and notification costs to data breach victims, 
68 percent, 62 percent and 59 percent of respondents 
respectively). Thirty\-four percent of respondents say 
their insurance reimburse costs related to ransomware.

35 percent of respondents say they have a trade secret 
theft insurance policy and a similar percentage of 
respondents (34 percent) have an intellectual property

72 A detailed review of insurance policies indicates that IP coverage is included in 
existing policies at a much lower rate than survey responses reflect especially for 
patent infringement and trade secrets theft, which detailed reviews show less than

Cyber liability and IP risks rank in the top 10 of all 
business risks facing organizations. According to
Figure 23, 56 percent of respondents consider cyber 
risk as the number one or two business risk (21 percent 
of respondents) and among the top five (35 percent 
of respondents). Similarly, 53 percent of respondents 
rate the risk to their companys intellectual property (IP) 
among the top 5 off all business risks (19 percent \+
34 percent).
Even though calculating the frequency and severity 
of intangible asset risks compared to intangible asset 
value relative to other organization assets is not a 
perfectly scientific mathematical exercise, we cannot 
afford to ignore the risks that are hardest to measure 
 especially when they may pose the greatest threats 
to our organizations.The most calamitous failures 
of prediction usually have a lot in common. We focus 
on those signals that tell a story about the world as 
we would like it to be, not how it really is. We ignore 
the risks that are hardest to measure, even when they 
pose the greatest threats to our well\-being. We make 
approximations and assumptions about the world that 
are much cruder than we realize. We abhor uncertainty, 
even when it is an irreducible part of the problem we are 
trying to solve.

increased. Organizations represented in this research 
estimate that the average total value of their IP
assets such as trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade 
secrets and know\-how is $600 million. An average of
47 percent of organizations total assets are IP assets.
As shown in Figure 24, 61 percent of respondents say

There are inherent limitations to survey research that need 
to be carefully considered before drawing inferences 
from findings. The following items are specific limitations 
that are germane to most web\-based surveys.
Non\-response bias: The current findings are based 
on a sample of survey returns. We sent surveys to 
a representative sample of individuals, resulting 
in a large number of usable returned responses. 
Despite non\-response tests, it is always possible that 
individuals who did not participate are substantially 
different in terms of underlying beliefs from those who 
completed the instrument. 
Sampling frame bias: The accuracy is based on 
contact information and the degree to which the list is 
representative of individuals who are involved in their 
companys cyber and enterprise risk management. 
We also acknowledge that the results may be biased 
by external events such as media coverage. We also 
acknowledge bias caused by compensating subjects to 
complete this research within a specified time period. 
Self\-reported results: The quality of survey research 
is based on the integrity of confidential responses 
received from subjects. While certain checks and 
balances can be incorporated into the survey process, 
there is always the possibility that a subject did not 
provide accurate responses.
