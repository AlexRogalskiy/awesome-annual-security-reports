IN COLLABORATION WITH
By the year 2024, the computer had become the central force of the workplace. Long gone were 
the days of the typewriter, ling cabinets, and notepads and in their place, every ofce worker 
had become a machine of one, powered by their device, speeding through each eight\-hour day on 
a keyboard and furiously clicking in the name of Productivity. 
With the surge in global computer use came the creation of a new role within the modern 
organization the security operations center (SOC). Given the difcult task of safeguarding the 
productive relationship between people and machines, the SOC quickly realized the daunting 
challenges they were up against. Rampant password reuse, burgeoning digital users, and the rise 
of crafty cybercriminals threatened their organizations at every turn. 
And as the world and workplace continued to develop, the challenges only grew from 
high\-volume data leaks to stealthy infostealer malware, stolen session cookies, and prot\-hungry 
ransomware gangs. The SOC gathered what tools they could nd, and together with their fellow 
Defenders gave an admirable attempt at leveling the ght between themselves and the enemies 
that threatened Productivity enemies that were shapeshifting and multiplying before their eyes. 
Would it be enough?

SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS
Every year, improving ransomware prevention capabilities is one of the top priorities for organizations 
in the immediate future. Even with focused efforts, the risk of the ransomware threat remains high 
survey respondents rank ransomware as their biggest threat among eight categories. 
The survey data validates security teams concerns, with 75% of organizations reporting being 
affected1 by ransomware more than once in the past 12 months a jump from 61% last year. 
Nearly 100% of the surveyed organizations are concerned about the potential for identity, session cookie, and other data 
siphoned from malware\-infected devices being used to enable follow\-on attacks like ransomware. But some good news 
 respondents second biggest priority for the next 12\-18 months is to improve visibility and remediation for
compromised credentials and malware\-exltrated data.
For organizations who reported being affected by ransomware in the past year, stolen cookies that enabled session 
hijacking ranked as the third most common entry point for ransomware attempts and successful attacks, 
following phishingsocial engineering and third\-party access. 
More than half (57\.5%) of teams report that they routinely invalidate or terminate open sessions for applications in 
response to a managed device getting infected with malware, which shows heightened awareness of the growing 
session hijacking problem. 
Nearly all surveyed organizations are concerned about the risks from third\-party accounts being 
compromised due to malware infections and 82% are either extremely or signicantly concerned. 
Additionally, participants rank third\-party access as the second most common entry point for 
ransomware.

KEY FINDINGS BY ROLE AND INDUSTRY
CIOs, CISOs, and other IT security executives are much more condent about their organizations ability to 
prevent a full\-blown ransomware attack 91% of leaders are generally condent, compared to 54% of 
security operators, analysts, and incident responders, and 71% of access and identity management 
professionals. Likewise, leaders express much higher condence in their organizations malware and 
ransomware response capabilities. This difference in perception reects a disconnect when it comes to 
shared understanding of an organizations cybersecurity posture. 
Identity and access management (IAM) directors, managers, and team leads are the cohort most concerned about 
exposure from malware\-infected devices and compromised or infected third\-party accounts. Case in point, 95% are 
extremely or signicantly concerned about data siphoned from malware\-infected devices being used for more 
harmful attacks, vs. 83% of security directors, managers, and team leads, and vs. 69% of analysts and incident 
responders. Additionally, IAM professionals are more concerned about risks to their organization from third\-party 
accounts compromised by malware infections, and are also more likely to name stolen cookies as one of the riskiest 
ransomware entry points.
Survey respondents from each sector rank ransomware as the biggest threat to their organization. 
However, only three sectors manufacturing, retail, and technology rate improved ransomware 
prevention capabilities among their two main priorities in the next 12 to 18 months. Technology and 
manufacturing also express the highest concern for compromised third\-party accounts. Interestingly, 
retail respondents rank their ability to identify business applications exposed by a malware infection 
as their organizations top capability.

THE MALWARE AND RANSOMWARE
RESURGENCE.
After a brief decline in activity in late 2022, ransomware 
re\-emerged with a vengeance over the last 18 months. 
Like a villain with endless lives, ransomware actors not only 
refused to give up, theyve had an unprecedented run
CHECKPOINT
IBM security researchers reported a
266% upsurge in the use of
infostealers by groups that
specialize in ransomware. 
They also noted signs of continued
investment in infostealer innovation.
Ransomware payments soared past $1 billion in 2023 while the volume, frequency, scope of attacks, and number 
of new players spiked as well, ranging from solo actors and small groups to powerful syndicates with robust 
afliate business models. 
Collectively, these actors continuously wreaked havoc across sectors. In the past 12 months, they:
Disrupted the operations of thousands of automotive dealerships for days
Caused $100 million in nancial losses to a major hotel and casino chain
Forced the ninth\-largest US city to close court hearings and other services for weeks
Stole 6TB worth of data belonging to as many as one\-third of American consumers including identity and 
health information and caused widespread outages across the healthcare ecosystem
These are just a few examples of the destructive power that ransomware wields over organizations. The losses 
from this destruction can be immense the average cost of a ransomware attack is now $4\.91 million.
The resurgence of ransomware comes at a time when another big shift is taking place. Cybercriminals have 
pivoted to next\-generation tactics, using information\-stealing malware (or infostealers) to siphon credentials, 
session cookies, and identity data from infected users and selling this information to ransomware operators.
At SpyCloud, we have continuously tracked the ongoing rise of the infostealer trend and its impact on follow\-on 
attacks like ransomware. Combined with a similarly explosive growth in digital identity exposure in the past few 
years, these two trends are fueling a perfect storm for ransomware crimes.

Here are just a few of the 
components that remove the 
barrier to entry into cybercrime for 
aspiring and seasoned players 
alike:
This off\-the\-shelf model for a variety of 
malware, and especially infostealers, 
enables even low\-skilled cybercriminals to 
steal fresh and accurate identity data in bulk, 
including login credentials, session cookies, 
and device details basically everything 
needed to impersonate an identity.
Also known as ad brokers, install services, 
and pay\-per\-install (PPI) services, these 
specialists offer a network of websites and 
advertisements that facilitate an affordable 
way to distribute malware at scale.
These individuals or entities sell guaranteed 
access into an organizations network. IABs 
typically rent access to tools like infostealers 
from MaaS providers and then sell the 
access data to ransomware operators. 
This widely available business model 
provides access to an operators proven 
tools and tactics everything needed to 
launch ransomware attacks, complete with 
support service and even tutorials for a 
subscription fee or percentage of ransom 
payments.

WHAT SPYCLOUD RESEARCH SAYS
The scale of identity exposure due to infostealers is massive: 61% of breaches 
last year were malware\-related and responsible for 343\.78 million stolen 
credentials. 
Our recaptured data also shows that as many as 1 in 5 people are the victim 
of an infostealer infection, with each infection exposing anywhere from 10 
to 25\+ third\-party business application credentials, on average.
MASSIVE SCALE OF IDENTITY EXPOSURES CREATES NEW RISKS
Through a deep analysis of recaptured infostealer logs, we discovered that the 
presence of infostealer malware correlates to the likelihood that a company 
will experience a ransomware attack in the near future.
Nearly one\-third of companies that experienced a ransomware event last 
year had at least one infostealer infection in the 16 weeks prior to being 
attacked.
INFOSTEALERS LEAD TO FUTURE RANSOMWARE ATTACKS
According to our recent research, for the rst six months of 2024, at least 54% 
of devices infected with infostealer malware had an antivirus or EDR 
solution installed at the time of successful malware infection.2
With infostealers and session hijacking at play, traditional solutions like 
antivirus and multifactor authentication (MFA) dont mean youre
fully protected.
ANTIVIRUS, MFA, AND TRADITIONAL DEFENSES ARENT ENOUGH
2 54% is likely low, as not all infostealers collect sufcient data to determine whether an antivirusendpoint
detection \& response (EDR) solution was installed and running on the infected device.
So how well are current ransomware defenses keeping up with the pace, tactics, and 
scale of cybercriminal innovation? Thats what we set out to uncover.

WHY WE DO THIS REPORT
CHECKPOINT
The numbers in this report that show the prevalence and impact of ransomware only tell part of 
the story. The developments that every organization should be concerned about happen beyond 
the edges of the cybersecurity world, deep in the criminal underground. This hidden, sprawling 
ecosystem is home to a burgeoning number of specialized products and services for
cybercrime enablement.
The standardization and professionalizing of what were once ad\-hoc activities is a contributing 
factor that makes digital identities a top attack vector. With identity data exltrated from user 
devices infected by malware at their ngertips, a growing crop of unskilled cybercriminals can 
hijack a user session, initiate account takeover (ATO), and gain access that enables them to 
launch ransomware attacks. 
We do this survey because our mission is to disrupt the cycle of cybercrime, and the cybercrime 
problem as it stands today is big.

For this fourth annual report, we surveyed 510 individuals in active cybersecurity roles within organizations in the 
US and the UK with at least 500 employees.
As youll see, we asked them about:
Their top concerns about malware and ransomware, as well as current defense practices
Common entry points for real\-life ransomware incidents
The impact of ransomware attacks on their organization in the past 12 months, including ransom payments, 
data recovery, and cumulative response costs 
Key ransomware prevention strategies and future security priorities
Survey respondents roles range from cybersecurity analysts to C\-suite security executives. About one\-third of the

TOP THREE CONCERNS
Like the majority of cybercriminals, ransomware actors are largely driven by their desire to build a cache of prots, 
and businesses are the ones that ultimately pay that price. 
Research suggests that ransom payments surged last year, with a 2\.6x increase in the average payment and 5x 
in the median. Likewise, recovery costs have followed an upward trajectory every year, climbing to an average of 
$2\.73 million in 2024 (compared to $1\.82 million in 2023\). As nancial losses from ransomware continue to climb, 
so does the frequency of incidents: insurance claims data shows a 64%
increase in 2023 compared to the prior year.
So its no surprise that ransomware maintained a strong lead among our
survey respondents as the greatest threat to their organization. Like last year,
ransomware, phishing, and infostealers remain the top three concerns that keep
security professionals up at night (Figure 3\).

A NEXT\-GEN THREAT: HOW SESSION HIJACKING COMPOUNDS RANSOMWARE RISK
Next\-generation ATO which uses session hijacking instead of relying on traditional credentials allows threat actors to 
sidestep all types of authentication, including MFA and passwordless authentication. By hijacking user sessions that have 
already been authenticated, cybercriminals (including ransomware operators) become a clone of a legitimate employee, 
without setting off typical anti\-fraud alarm bells. This greatly increases their success rate of gaining access to an 
organizations network and systems to launch an attack.
Last year, SpyCloud recaptured more than 20 billion cookie records from infostealer malware, with an average 2,000\+ records 
per infected device. Leveraging malware\-siphoned session cookies for next\-generation account takeover is becoming an 
increasingly common cybercrime tactic.

Our survey ndings reect the growing presence of infostealers in headlines as well as their prevalence as a 
tactic. What worries us the most is the stealers continued evolution. Every year, the vast malware expanse 
draws in new infostealer families often with new capabilities that allow them to bypass IAM security 
features and evade detection. Elusive, for instance, uses advanced encryption to stay stealthy, while Lumma 
can allegedly restore expired auth cookies to hijack user accounts. 
STEALTHY STEALERS AT PLAY
Because infostealers are designed to steal information from an infected 
host, they make great accomplices to ransomware actors attempting to 
gain credentials before moving laterally in an environment.
Many infostealers also double as malware loaders, allowing the 
stealers to load secondary payloads such as persistent malware or 
ransomware. This behavior is observed in RisePro, Lumma, Mystic 
Stealer, and others.

TOP INFOSTEALER VILLAINS
StealC
Described as a copycat of Vidar and Raccoon, StealC can be customized to steal data 
based on the cybercriminals needs. This infostealer is commonly distributed by 
so\-called malware traffers organized cybercrime workers who are responsible for 
redirecting victim traffic to malicious content operated by others.
MetaStealer
An improved version of RedLine that steals credentials and cryptocurrency 
wallets. Its deployed through malspam email campaigns, cracked software 
advertisements on social media like YouTube, and malvertising.
RisePro
A sophisticated stealer that not only exfiltrates sensitive data but also serves as 
a malware loader, enabling the deployment of secondary payloads like other malware 
or ransomware. This dual functionality enhances its threat level. 
CryptBot
Reemerged with a new and improved version targeting sensitive data like logins and 
credit card data stored in browsers. This infostealer is distributed via 
compromised websites that seem to offer cracked video games and other popular 
software.
OTHER STEALERS TO KEEP ON YOUR RADAR
LummaC2
Known for its dynamic configurations, LummaC2 can customize what data it steals in 
real time. In late 2023, it added email theft from various clients, Google cookie 
regeneration, and turning infected bots into SOCKS proxies. It also targets browser 
extensions and claims to steal 2FA secrets, making it a multi\-faceted threat.
WorldWind Prynt Stealer
While not as configurable as other stealers on this list, 
WorldWind uses Telegram as its exfiltration route by default, 
shortening the time to stolen information access, especially for 
less\-technical cybercriminals.
Atomic Stealer
Atomic is notorious for targeting macOS, and particularly cryptocurrency 
enthusiasts as its victims. It deploys a backdoor specifically designed to steal 
seed phrases from victims using the Ledger Live crypto wallet. Its also 
well\-known for harvesting data from browser extensions, making it a 
broad\-spectrum threat.
RedLine
A highly adaptable stealer recognized for its dynamic configurations, enabling it to 
adjust its stealing and loading capabilities on the fly. It can also regenerate 
expired Google cookies, a feature first observed with LummaC2\. Its flexibility and 
advanced functionalities make it a significant threat, and it has wide acceptance by 
the criminal community.

BATTLING CYBER THREATS: FIGHTING FOR THE UPPER HAND
Despite worthwhile concerns about infostealers, surveyed organizations show some big gaps in their ability to 
remediate malware exposures. Identifying business applications exposed by malware and invalidating 
compromised web sessions are two of the most critical steps that address the long\-term risks of malware 
yet they rank at the bottom of malware detection and response capabilities (Figure 5\).
Perceptions do vary across roles, though. Most notably, executive leaders are the only group that rank all of their 
organizations capabilities higher than the average across all roles. In general, they seem more condent than 
other cybersecurity professionals in their security teams capabilities.

MALWARE INFECTION REMEDIATION PRACTICES: FAR FROM A CRITICAL HIT
While theres universal agreement that more needs to be done to address the malware problem, we also asked 
organizations what their standard practices look like today to better understand the baseline. 
The top routine actions that organizations take in response to a malware infection on an infected device are:
Investigating the incident (79%)
Resetting passwords for portentially exposed applications (77%)
Attempting to remove the malware (67%)

Regardless of what drove the change, keep in mind the shift to a brute force reset and wipe doesnt solve the 
larger issue of stolen data, and thus access, in the wrong hands. Reviewing logs to analyze exposure and

RISK FROM THIRD\-PARTY EXPOSURE: ADVERSARIES EXTRA ADVANTAGE
Threat actors leverage plenty of strategies to gain an upper hand in the malware landscape, but nothing presents 
as big an opportunity as infected third\-party and unmanaged devices. The digital\-rst environment has opened 
the oodgates to unmanaged and third\-party devices, and security teams often have little\-to\-no visibility into 
vulnerabilities associated with these endpoints. This has huge implications because third\-party devices and users 
greatly increase exposure to threats. 
THE 2024 SPYCLOUD MALWARE AND RANSOMWARE DEFENSE REPORT
21
MENU
STATUS
ILLUMINATE YOUR ATTACK SURFACE
Security researchers found that as many as 90% of security 
compromises originate from unmanaged devices. Outside of
IT control and visibility and with limited security, these devices 
hold an undeniable appeal for threat actors.
Whether these devices belong to your employees or third
parties, theyre used to access your corporate applications 
and our research shows that, on average, a single malware 
infection exposes access to 10 to 25 business applications.
Add to that the fact that the average organization has more
than 300 applications technically, a single malware infection 
can expose access to all of them.
Last year, SpyCloud recaptured more than 4\.7 million third\-party 
application credentials harvested by malware on both managed 
and unmanaged devices. These malware\-harvested third\-party 
credentials came from numerous popular business apps in
these categories:
Communication \& collaboration (nearly 2M credentials)
Human resources (1M)
Software development \& IT tools (714k)
Customer support (208k)
Identity \& access management (204k)
Each of these compromised third\-party applications as well as 
every single unmanaged and third\-party device opens the door 
to sensitive information that can be ransomed.
!
PLAYER TIP
Without visibility into these exposures, its difcult for an 
organization to fully understand its risk and properly defend itself. 
As shown in Figure 5 earlier, detecting third\-party or 
unmanaged devices infected by malware is the capability 
organizations lack the most today. 
Additionally, almost all survey participants are concerned about 
risks stemming from infected or compromised third\-party accounts 
(Figure 8, Page 23\). Nobody understands the risks better than IAM 
teams, who are the most extremely concerned likely because 
they understand the reality of both the scale of third\-party access 
to corporate applications, and limitations in organizations ability to 
detect or remediate resulting unauthorized access. 
Whether cybercriminals leverage compromised third\-party 
accounts, unmanaged devices, or other vulnerable entry points, 
chances are that with malware tactics, they can quickly escalate to 
the next level: ransomware.
CHECKPOINT
THE RANSOMWARE LANDSCAPE:
LAND OF INFINITE GAMEPLAY.
If the inux of new players is any indication, the 
ransomware terrain is far from inhospitable for 
cybercriminals. Some researchers noted 538 new variants

actors.

plate or others changed groups to avoid detection or sanctioning. Meanwhile, in the 
latest example of threat actors resilience, LockBit though weakened simply 
respawned a few days later with a new leak site and resumed posting data. 
Given the ransomware cybercriminals stamina, it comes as no surprise to see an 
increase in the number of surveyed organizations that have been affected by 
ransomware in the past 12 months. The number of organizations affected by 
ransomware at least once rose from 81% to 92% and those affected3 more 
than once grew even more signicantly, from 61% last year to 75% this year.
This means that we saw a sharp decline in organizations that werent hit at all, down 
to just 8% this year, compared to 19% in 2023\.

Technically, it can be very difcult to 
encrypt a target and provide keys to 
unencrypt it after receiving a 
ransomware payment. Some 
ransomware groups have taken to 
skipping the lock and encrypt 
component of traditional 
ransomware and have instead 
largely pivoted to simply 
exltrating data and extorting 
payment in order to prevent the 
ransomware actor from posting the 
stolen data on a leak site.

Unfortunately, our data shows that year\-over\-year, signicantly more organizations paid a ransom in the past 12 
months: 62% this year vs. 48% in last years report (Figure 9\). But only about a third of those organizations fully 
recovered their data, which is a stark reminder that giving in to cybercriminals demands is a gamble, and the odds 
are not always in your favor. 
Additionally:
There was a signicant uptick in those who paid and lost the data or had to recover it another way: 13% vs. 3% last year. 
The number of those who paid ransom and lost all their data tripled, from 1\.2% to 3\.7%. Fortunately, this number is 
comparatively small; however, the implications for those who experience this data loss could be felt deeply.

Perhaps buoyed by their growing success rates, ransomware groups have become bolder: nearly two\-thirds of 
ransom demands last year were for $1 million or more, with an average of $4\.3 million. One ransomware group 
recently received an unprecedented ransom payment of $75 million. And reports to the FBI last year show a 74% 
increase in the cost of ransomware incidents last year compared to 2022\. 
We see some of this reected in our data as well. There was an increase in the number of organizations 
paying more than $1 million in cumulative costs from 39% last year to 44% this year (Figure 10\).

In some cases, cumulative costs can extend to general disruption, loss of business and opportunities, productivity 
decreases, reputational damage, and more. For instance, 49% of an organizations computers are impacted by a 
ransomware attack, which can severely cripple business functions. And, as we saw from some of the recent 
incidents mentioned earlier, this disruption can last for weeks and sometimes months.

CRACKS IN YOUR CYBER DEFENSES: COMMON ATTACK ENTRY POINTS
For the rst time, we also asked survey participants who were affected by ransomware to share the entry points 
used by attackers to gain initial access. They reported the most common entry points to be phishingsocial 
engineering, third\-party access, and stolen cookies that enabled session hijacking (Figure 11\). 
While compromised session cookies are a newer entry point for ransomware, we expect to see session hijacking 
continue to gather momentum, and the more organizations are aware and prepared, the better off theyll be. 
Interestingly enough, identity teams are ahead of others in seeing this entry point more often: 20% of IAM 
directors, managers, or specialists called it out, compared to only 12% of their security counterparts and 15% of 
analysts and incident responders. 
Some session cookies can remain valid for weeks, months, and even longer. Since many organizations dont yet 
monitor for cookies stolen by infostealer malware let alone invalidate those sessions a single infection could 
leave an organization exposed. When leveraged by ransomware perpetrators, this access can come with 
immense consequences.

In terms of general perceptions about the riskiest potential entry point, its not unexpected to see phishingsocial

historically have been big issues. But this perception also colors their remediation efforts and traditional remediation 
methods have lost their effectiveness when it comes to combating the full scope of the ransomware threat.

NEXT\-GEN SHOWDOWN: THE FUTURE OF RANSOMWARE DEFENSE
Traditional malware mitigation, which is only focused on the infected device, is akin to a stun. At best, it gets rid of 
the infection. It doesnt prevent cybercriminals from taking advantage of the data they siphoned from the device 
because it stops short of remediating the prolonged risk from that exposed data. To negate the opportunities 
created by infostealer\-exltrated data and to disrupt ransomware attacks, security teams and their counterparts in 
fraud prevention need to shift their focus to the digital identity. 
With ransomware operators showing more interest in next\-generation tactics like using infostealer\-exltrated 
session cookies organizations must shift to next\-generation defense. So, are they? As our data below shows, not 
as much as wed like to see.
PLAYER TIP
THE IDENTITY\-CENTRIC APPROACH
Identity\-centric malware remediation includes extra steps like resetting application credentials and invalidating 
session cookies that have been exltrated by malware. But rst, you must monitor for compromised credentials 
and session cookies a countermeasure lower on many organizations priority list this year (Figure 12\).
Malicious actors are moving beyond the traditional use of stolen username and password pairs to 
perpetrate crimes against employees and organizations. Using expanded datasets, criminals have 
increased the scope of their attack patterns, based upon identity records that come from different 
sources and that can be linked together using PII, like social security numbers or social handles.
Case in point, the National Public Data breach is a prime example of how bad actors are targeting 
identity data that can be used in follow\-on attacks.
In this way, users now have to worry about their combined digital identity, which can be formed by 
cross\-referencing the information that has been stolen about them from dozens or hundreds of 
sources. An identity\-centric approach means SOC teams expand their defensive posture beyond just 
the device to account for the many facets of the modern digital identity.

Data backup and endpoint or device protection have maintained their position on the list of the most important 
countermeasures from last year, while MFA moved up six spots to No. 2\. This suggests that MFA adoption is now 
more mainstream, but its also a cautionary tale. Cybercriminals are adapting to current trends, and as weve seen 
in the past year, theyre targeting MFA. With infostealer\-siphoned session cookies, they can simply hijack the 
session and bypass even the most robust MFA setup.
The bottom line is that a multilayered strategy is as important as ever, but you need to adapt your strategy to 
make sure old and new critical layers are covered.

noted a ray of optimism this year: theres an uptick in the number of respondents expressing general condence in 
their organizations ability to prevent a full\-blown ransomware attack from 79% last year to 81% this year (Figure 13\). 
Its worth noting that not all data points support this level of condence, particularly in areas relating to holistic

As noted earlier, executives are also more condent than everyone else in their organizations malware detection 
and response capabilities. This is perhaps a sign of a small disconnect, showing a need for the C\-suite to be 
deeper acquainted with their organizational cybersecurity posture. 
Both sides can be the heroes of their story if they work together to ensure better alignment. After all, theyre on the 
same team. That makes them partners in upholding their organizations trust and brand reputation choosing 
more preventative, layered, and calculated approaches that suit the needs of their board, their customers, and 
external stakeholders. 
Add to that some other good news that tips the odds in favor of the SOC:
More teams strongly agree that they need visibility into malware\-exltrated data, particularly the very large 
enterprises (25,000\+ employees) and the nancial services industry.
More organizations are taking the right steps to remediate malware, with an uptick in respondents reporting that they 
proactively reset passwords for exposed applications. Larger organizations show even more signs of maturity, like 
adopting full remediation steps to respond to malware infections on managed devices.
Organizations are recognizing that stolen cookies that enable account takeover create high risk of ransomware 
attacks, and are adopting practices to routinely invalidate or terminate open sessions on managed devices 
compromised by malware.
IAM teams appear to be more tuned into the identity\-related threats and are playing a bigger role in the ght.

Improving ransomware prevention capabilities
Improving visibility and remediation for compromised credentials and malware\-exltrated data 
Automating security processes and controls 
Better addressing risk tied to third\-party exposures
Improving ransomware response plans and procedures

STATUS
As opposed to more targeted attacks, infostealers are often launched at scale against a wide array of targets. To 
identify targets for follow\-on attacks, criminals using stealers employ tools and services to sift through massive 
amounts of exltrated data, selling the most critical access to specialized brokers or using the access themselves 
for other attacks, including ransomware. 
To stop cybercriminals before they can prot from stolen data, security teams need to work quickly and proactively. 
Strategies we recommend:
ADOPT AN IDENTITY\-CENTRIC SECURITY APPROACH
With digital identities now rmly in cybercriminals sights, relying on old defense tactics like device\-centric 
remediation is bound to fail. Outpacing ransomware players is an attainable goal when you can act on the full 
expanse of compromised identity data for your users, whether it involves employees, contractors, or vendors.
ILLUMINATE YOUR FULL ATTACK SURFACE, INCLUDING UNMANAGED AND THIRD\-PARTY USERS 
Unauthorized third\-party access is high on teams radar, rated as the second most risky entry point for 
ransomware in this years survey. By improving visibility into malware\-exltrated data including unmanaged 
and third\-party devices outside of traditional corporate oversight youll have more complete coverage and 
faster discovery of exposed applications, and therefore drastically reduce your time to remediation. 
USE AUTOMATION TO SPEED UP DETECTION AND MITIGATION
We know cybercriminals are leveraging automation, but as they get faster, so can we.By leveraging 
automated alerts and incident notications for new breaches and malware infections, you can more quickly 
operationalize data and feed it into automated remediation workows to negate its impact. 
EXPAND ATO PREVENTION TO ACCOUNT FOR BOTH TRADITIONAL AND NEXT\-GENERATION THREATS
In addition to hardening credentials to block traditional ATO, defenders have to expand focus to prevent 
session hijacking by monitoring for stolen web sessions programmatically and then implement processes for 
invalidating web sessions associated with infected identities. Think of it as changing the locks before anyone 
can get in.

STATUS
YES, THE ENEMY LURKS, BUT ONWARD WE TREAD
MOVING FORWARD DESPITE PERSISTENT RISKS
Infostealers are too successful for ransomware operators to stop using any time soon. This quiet precursor to 
ransomware is notoriously difcult to detect. Virtually all our survey respondents are worried about the potential of 
malware\-siphoned data to be leveraged for follow\-on attacks and rightfully so. 
Although this years results give us a sliver of hope, organizations can strategically focus resources to achieve a 
more complete malware response to prevent ransomware attacks:
Phishing, infostealer malware, and third\-party users and devices are among the greatest threats that survey 
participants have identied, and all these threats work in tandem to compound the risk of ransomware.
The most effective capabilities for complete malware remediation, including identifying applications exposed by 
malware infections and invalidating compromised web sessions, are areas where organizations can make the
most improvements.
Just over half of organizations take steps like reviewing logs of potentially exposed applications and terminating 
open sessions for applications and without those steps, they remain exposed.
DEPLOY A CONTINUOUS ZERO TRUST APPROACH
Only 37% of organizations plan to prioritize implementing or enhancing their Zero Trust model in the near 
future. As it's become a standard, continuing to invest in Continuous Zero Trust can go a long way to help 
organizations account for the full scope ofidentity, device, and access information that criminals have in 
hand about employees. By continuously verifying every user's identity for compromise when accessing your 
applications, you can get ahead of costly attacks and prevent unauthorized access.
