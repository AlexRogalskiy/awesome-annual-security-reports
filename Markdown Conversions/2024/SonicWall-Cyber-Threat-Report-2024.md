SonicWall2\|2024 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|IntroductionSmall Cracks Lead to Big PayoutsCyberattacks are big news. Reports of attacks at large,well\-known companies or local government offices makeheadlines on a seemingly constant basis. For those followingcybersecurity a bit more closely, the view isnt too different,with cybersecurity news outlets coverage of top breachesdominated by household names like Mailchimp, MGM,Activision and 23andMe.Based on what gets reported, it wouldnt be unreasonableto assume that cybercrime is a far bigger problem for WallStreet than for Main Street. Unfortunately, nothing could befurther from the truth. In a 2023 blog, CISA reported thatsmall businesses are three times more likely to be targetedby threat actors than larger organizations. And these SMBattacks represent billions of dollars in losses each year.Thats a key reason why SonicWall is so committed toresearching and publishing the latest threat intelligence. WithSMBs making up 80% of our end users, our data presents aview of the threat landscape unlike what youll find anywhereelse one centered less around large multinationalconglomerates, and more on businesses just like yours.2023s Top Trends
Perhaps the biggest trend we observed in the 2023 landscapeOur data continued to reflect vulnerabilities as the mostcommon ransomware vector and this will likely remainthe case as the number of vulnerabilities continues to climb.A record 28,834 CVEs were published in 2023, a 15%increase over 2022s numbers. In December, SonicWallsthreat researchers discovered and responsibly disclosedCVE\-2023\-51467, a vulnerability affecting ApacheOFBiz. Largenumbers of exploitation attempts have since been observed.Other campaigns displayed a similar level of innovation.

While one wouldexpect increasing malware attack volumes and persistentlyhigh phishing levels to beaccompanied by high rates of newmalware, we found the opposite to be true: Never\-before\-seenmalware detections actually fell 38% year over year.But this doesnt mean threat actors werent refining their craft.SonicWall researchers observed the emergence of MicrosoftOneNote files as an initial threat vector, as well as massivecampaigns targeting vulnerabilities in WinRAR and MOVEit.From SMB to the Enterprise, Today and Tomorrow
Were already looking toward a future threat landscape muchdifferent from todays, as threat actors continue adoptingChatGPT and other generative AI technology to refinephishing attempts, carry out highly convincing Business EmailCompromise (BEC) attacks, and quickly write malicious code.But AI also holds great promise for the worlds defenders.SonicWall was an early adopter of AI and machine learning, withCapture ATP and RTDMI already capable of detecting many ofthese types of attacks. But in coming years, well begin to seethe true potential of AI as a defensive tool.3\|2024 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|IntroductionMALWAREHighest Since 2019In 2023, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers recordedMicrosoft OneNote files.

A 36% decreasesounds like a lot until you consider ransomwares growthbetween 2020 and 2022\. Even after this drop, 2023 still hadenough ransomware to be the third\-highest year on record.And with 27% more ransomware in the second half of2023 than the first half, ransomware is trending in thewrong direction to meaningfully undo 2021 and 2022smeteoric spikes.When cybersecurity vendors like SonicWall measureransomware and other threats, they can only see whatshappening across their own ecosystem. While SonicWall(with its large partner and MSP customer base) noted adecline in ransomware over 2023, some other vendorsrecorded increases over the same period. With increased lawenforcement efforts making each attack riskier, and SMBsto the cloud, but often arent ensuring these instances havethe same protection as on\-prem. As threat actors continuerefining ransomware attacks on SaaS, failing to ensuresufficient security in the cloud could have disastrous results.There are also still plenty of huge ransomware campaignsbeing run. In late May, SonicWall observed the exploitationof a critical\-rated, zero\-day SQL injection vulnerability withinMOVEit Transfer. The popularity of this file transfer tool andits widespread adoption by enterprises made it a target ofthe Cl0p ransomware gang. It leveraged CVE\-2023\-34362to conduct a supply chain attack that affected about 2,000organizations across financial, insurance, healthcare, educationand government, with data theft impacting more than 62million people.Its important to note that vulnerabilities such as this onewere the most common vector SonicWall observed forransomware in 2023 and those campaigns contributedto ransomware payments surpassing $1 billion for thefirst time in 2023\.7\|2024 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|RansomwareINTRUSIONSAttempts Up 20%Overall intrusion attempts continued to climb in 2023,19% for education customers, 34% for retail customers,rising to 7\.6 trillion, a 20% increase over 2022s total.

Itinvolves the installation of malware, often delivered viaphishing emails or compromised websites, that secretly runs inthe background on a victims computer, smartphone or server.This malware uses the devices processing power and energyto solve complex mathematical problems (proof of work),generating cryptocurrency for the attacker.10\|2024 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|CryptojackingCryptojackings Current Course

But it still eatsup a lot of CPU as it mines in the background and it doesso constantly.This ultimately proves costly, both in terms of productivity,as cryptojacking can slow non\-mining activities significantly,and also in terms of actual money: Not only is the victimpaying for the increased energy consumption, they may alsohave to replace devices that overheat or have their lifespanshortened by these taxing processes.Despite the high cost of mining cryptocurrency,cryptomining is not illegal, and cryptojacking is rarelyprosecutedthough this may be changing. 2024 has alreadyseen one high\-profile cryptojacking arrest, as a collaborationbetween Europol, Ukrainian law enforcement and a cloudprovider resulted in the arrest of a suspect believed to haveillegally mined more than $2 million in cryptocurrency.According to SonicWall data, cryptojacking hits madeup one\-sixth of all malware hits in 2023\. As illicit miningbecomes more popular, we may start to see the same sort ofconcerted public and private sector responses that emergedfrom the early 2020s boom in ransomware.11\|2024 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|CryptojackingCAPTURE LABSRTDMI Detections Surpass 1\.5 MillionDespite increases across most threat types, SonicWallCapture Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) with Real\-TimeDeep Memory Inspection (RTDMI) recorded significantly fewernever\-before\-seen malware variants in 2023: 387,000, a 38%decrease year over year.Taken alongside rising malware and persistently high phishinglevels, this offers useful information about the 2023 threatlandscape: Threat actors arent slowing down, but for thetime being, theyre finding variants that work and usingthem repeatedly.
