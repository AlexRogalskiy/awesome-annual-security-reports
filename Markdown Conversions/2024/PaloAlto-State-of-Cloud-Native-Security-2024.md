The State of Cloud\-Native Security2
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A Retrospect 
on the 
Previous Year
We begin our exploration of the 
2024 state of cloud\-native security 
with a look back at the events and 
influences of 2023, each of which 
factors into our current postures, 
the challenges we confront, and 
the strategies weve chosen to 
achieve our desired outcomes.
While agile development, open\-source 
software, and cloud\-native technologies 
gained momentum in 2023, attacks 
targeting the application layer have 
become an established trend. The
cloud\-native ecosystem grappled with a 
surge in supply chain attacks, highlighting 
the prevalence of vulnerabilities in
open\-source software and third\-party 
libraries. Real\-world data analyzed by 
our Unit 42 team enhanced this picture, 
identifying the cloud as the dominant 
attack surface, with 80% of medium,
high, and critical exposures found in
cloud\-hosted assets.1
For some time, weve prioritized 
application and infrastructure security.
But we mustnt forget that third,
all\-important ball in the air. With the global 
datasphere reaching 120 zettabytes in 
2023,2 securing sensitive data remains 
mission critical. The challenges of 
monitoring and controlling sensitive 
information, however, have escalated.

The State of Cloud\-Native Security3
Whats more, generative AI emerged in 
2023 as a groundbreaking force with 
the potential to halve development time 
and costs, ultimately redefining the 
application economy.3 But much like the 
cloud and its myriad benefits inextricably 
tied to challenges we must address, 
generative AI as a development tool 
comes counterweighted with concerns. 
We had no sooner begun to wonder 
about potential issues when OWASP 
released the Top 10 LLM Security Risks 
for security teams, alerting us to prompt 
injection, insecure output handling, 
and new avenues for supply chain 
vulnerabilities and sensitive information 
disclosure.
But challenges are not new to us. Its 
safe to say that generative AI is as 
much a mainstay as the cloud. We will 
increasingly tap into its power with an 
awareness of responsibility and a priority 
of security.
Looking at the path ahead, as we move 
forward in the pursuit of our objectives, 
we are certain of one thingcloud 
security is as much a business goal as 
anything else we endeavor to achieve.

cloud environments.
The State of Cloud\-Native Security4
When readiness wins the race against 
time, its the name of the game. Youll 
hardly hear cloud security practitioners 
talk about pain points apart from the 
constraints of time. They are, after all, 
inundated with alerts and manually 
collating data from satellite tools while 
racing against attackers moving at 
machine speed to identify vulnerabilities.
Understandably, 90% of respondents 
from this years State of Cloud\-Native 
Security survey want better risk 
prioritization. Upwards of 90% say the 
number of point tools they use creates 
blind spots affecting their ability to 
prioritize risk and prevent threats. Sixty\-
two percent of security practitioners 
want easy\-to\-use security solutions, with 
1 in 3 respondents citing rapid technology 
changes as the primary obstacle 
contributing to attack surface expansion.
How multi is multicloud? Organizations 
are leveraging an average of 12 cloud 
service providers (CSPs) across SaaS, 
IaaS, and PaaS for their deployed 
applications. This, coupled with an 
average use of 16 cloud security tools, 
underscores the intricate ecosystem 
security teams must navigate. A 98% 
consensus emphasizes the importance 
of reducing the number of security 
tools, defining readiness in terms of 
simplification and consolidation.

Emerging concerns, such as the 
security risks associated with AI\-
generated code and unmanaged APIs, 
alongside traditional challenges like 
inadequate access management and the 
expanding attack surface, underscore 
the evolving nature of cloud security 
threats. Organizations are rethinking 
their strategies, with many emphasizing 
the need for foundational changes to 
enhance cloud security from the outset. 
Understanding the landscape is central 
to equipping security and DevOps teams 
with the necessary resources.
What steps are organizations taking to 
effectively navigate data security and the 
need for rapid deployment? Where are 
organizations running into challenges? How 
are they bridging security and development 
teams? How ready are organizations to 
handle AI\-related security risks? How 
effectively are they integrating solutions 
into their operational frameworks? 
Our annual multi\-industry survey seeks 
to answer these questions and more to 
provide insights into the best practices 
shaping the future of cloud\-native security.

Supporting this sentiment, our survey 
shows that organizations that moved 
workloads to the cloud without optimizing 
them for the cloud had higher total costs of 
ownership. Whats more, their applications

THE CLOUD ECONOMY
A Global 
Perspective
Across regions, cloud 
investment trends affirm 
the clouds strategic 
significance.
Organizations worldwide made substantial 
investments in cloud infrastructure, 
services, and operational efficiencies to 
drive digital transformation and expansion. 
The overall trend shows a surge in cloud 
spending with over 50% of organizations 
investing more than $10 million annually 
in cloud services. This integration of 
cloud technologies into various aspects 
of business operations suggests that 
investment trends will persist, if not 
accelerate, as organizations pursue greater 
agility, scalability, and innovation. 
The State of Cloud\-Native Security12
Among regions, we see slight but 
telling variations. Australia, Mexico, and 
Singapore exhibit strong cloud spending 
in higher investment brackets, while the 
United States and the United Kingdom 
continue to invest significantly in moderate 
ranges. Cloud spending patterns in 
France and Germany indicate a mature 
yet cautious approach, with the bulk of 
investments falling within the 9 million to 
46 million range.
In contrast, emerging markets like Brazil 
and India, along with Japan, have a higher 
proportion of organizations investing 
below the $10 million mark, at 40%, 41%, 
and 43%, respectively. Beyond cloud 
maturity, this trend may reflect a greater 
presence of small to medium\-sized 
organizations, as well as conservative 
spending strategies in these regions.
Organizations reporting Extensive 
Integration or Fully Native Environment 
tend to invest more in cloud technologies 
compared to those with Basic 
Infrastructure. In the U.K for instance, 
32% of organizations spending less than 
$10 million are at the initial stages of 
exploring the cloud, compared to 76% of 
those investing $10 million or more, having 
achieved extensive cloud integration. 
This pattern is consistent across regions, 
indicating that as organizations mature 
in their cloud journey, their cloud spend 
increases, likely due to the adoption 
of more advanced cloud services and 
architectures, in addition to scaling.

From 
Exploration to 
Cloud\-Native 
Innovation
The cloud journey is not 
linear. It is a continuum of 
adaptation, learning, and 
transformationone shaped 
by strategic investments, 
maturity levels, deployment 
methodologies, and 
operational efficiencies.
Cloud maturity extends beyond the 
adoption of technologies. It is both 
a reflection of and influence on an 
organizations culture, processes, and the 
ability to harness cloud capabilities for 
business transformation. Among this years 
survey respondents, maturity levels range 
from using basic cloud infrastructure for 
select projects to extensive integration and 
fully native cloud environments.
Across this range, we see a correlation in 
application deployment methodologies. 
Of respondents say they would 
spend more time refactoring 
their applications.

The deployment preference for 
lift and shift (35%) aligns with 
the pragmatic approach many 
organizations take toward cloud 
migration. While cloud\-native and 
refactoring deployments offer long\-
term benefits, the initial focus on fast, 
low\-disruption migration has been a 
historic approach.
Organizations that begin with 
lift and shift typically progress 
through refactoring to cloud\-native 
development, maturing beyond 
seeking quick wins to embracing 
cloud\-first strategies for gains 
in performance, scalability, and 
cost\-efficiency. Our survey bears 
out this trend, with cloud\-native 
deployments displacing lift and shift 
at 36% among organizations with 3 
or more years in the cloud.

legacy apps.
Plan for Cost 
Optimization 
of Legacy 
Apps
Legacy app modernization 
consumes a significant 
portion of cloud TCO, 
emphasizing the
importance of strategic
cloud migration planning.
The majority of respondents (67% 
globally) reports spending between 
10% to 30% of their cloud total cost 
of ownership (TCO) on legacy app 
modernization. For 24% of organizations, 
costs soar upwards of 30%, highlighting 
the need to balance operational 
continuity and the pursuit of innovation.
Among regional variations, Latin America 
and Japan and Asia\-Pacific report a higher 
percentage (29% and 26%, respectively) 
of respondents spending 30% or more 
of their cloud TCO on legacy app 
optimization. India stands out with 42% of 
respondents indicating that 30% or more 
of their cloud TCO goes toward optimizing 
legacy apps for the cloud. When asked 
why developers time is diverted to 
resolving bugs and code vulnerabilities, 
45% blame application architecture. 
The significant spend on legacy app 
modernization underscores the need 
for strategic planning in cloud migration 
projects. Organizations should assess 
which applications are suitable for 
lift and shift versus those that require 
refactoring or complete redevelopment 
to optimize costs and benefits. Security 
and compliance challenges make this 
particularly important, in that older 
applications may not have been designed 
with cloud\-native security in mind.

Needs
The cloud is, well, nebulous. 
Add a cloud service provider 
(CSP) here, a security tool 
there. The ecosystem extends. 
And extends. Complexity is a 
constant companion.
With an average of 16 cloud security 
tools on board, its no surprise that 98% 
of respondents consider it important to 
reduce this number. Almost as many (97%) 
want to reduce the average 14 vendors 
they work with. 
Taking on complexity in one form or 
another is a recurrent theme in annual 
publications of the State of Cloud\-Native 
Security Report. To date, weve not seen 
an indication of progress on this front. 
The number of tools dedicated to cloud 
security has, in fact, increased 60% from 
last years findings. The drive to address 
complexity, however, is visceral for those 
who routinely confront it.

In 2024, multicloud translates into 
approximately 12 cloud service providers 
across SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS per 
organization. Regional averages range 
from 16 in the U.S. to a no less impressive 
9 in Latin America. And this represents 
only the public cloud portion of the 
ecosystem, accounting for little more 
than half (52%) of an organizations cloud 
workloads. As organizations use more 
CSPs, maintaining visibility and ensuring 
consistent security policies, access controls, 
and data protection measures becomes 
taxing. Complexity and fragmentation of 
cloud environments, for more than half of 
survey respondents (54%), presents a major 
security challenge.
54% of respondents agree that

Cloud architecture introduces another layer of 
complexity. The distribution of workloads among 
different architectures seen among 2024 survey 
respondents suggests a transitional cloud landscape 
with organizations navigating between traditional 
(VMs) and modern (serverless) architectures. 
This diversity challenges security teams to create 
consistent policies and security solutions for 
these environments. Characterized by portability, 
granularity, ephemerality, and heterogeneity, 
modern workloads have expanded the attack 
surface. They require a different approach to 
security, one with actionable insights, monitoring, 
and incident response.

API Risks
Close behind in top\-ranked 
concerns, 43% of global 
respondents have their sights 
on API\-associated risks. As 
gateways for data exchange and 
integration between applications, 
APIs can enable unauthorized 
access, expose sensitive data, 
and create vulnerabilities for 
cyberattacks. 
Apprehension among organizations 
centers on unmanaged and 
unsecured APIs, third\-party API 
risks, and the lack of oversight in 
API integrations. 
Regionally, concern 
for API risks peaks 
in Brazil, where 52% 
of respondents view 
it as a significant 
threat vector.
AI\-Generated Code
Unforeseen vulnerabilities
and exploits introduced by
AI\-generated code are 
worrisome to 44% of 
organizations. As algorithms 
autonomously create software, 
the lack of human oversight may 
lead to undetected security flaws. 
Additionally, the rapid pace of 
AI\-generated code development 
could outstrip traditional security 
testing methods, resulting in a 
likelihood of vulnerabilities making 
it into production. 
While concerns in this area are 
widespread, apprehension is more 
pronounced in the U.S. and India.

The potential for greater sophistication and targeting leading to greater 
damage should alert organizations to the evolving threat landscape that 
AI represents.
CICDs Impact on the Attack Surface
With its potential to introduce vulnerabilities and quickly deploy 
them into production, the CICD pipelines impact on the attack 
surface concerns 34% of organizations. 
The concern spikes in Japan and Asia\-Pacific, where 40% consider 
the risks of increased vulnerabilities and security breaches a 
significant issue. 
Inadequate Access Management
Inadequate access management is cited by 35% of organizations 
as a top concern, emphasizing the challenges organizations face in 
controlling who has access to what within the cloud. 
Access control concerns are particularly acute in regions like Latin 
America, where 44% of respondents cite the need for effective identity 
and access management solutions.

Insider Threats
Insider threats are a concern 
for 32% of respondents. This 
rate is fairly consistent across 
regions, amplifying the universal 
challenge of mitigating risks 
associated with compromised 
insidersincluding business 
partners, third\-party vendors, and 
contractors, as well as employees. 
Given that 98% of organizations 
report storing data across 
numerous environments, 
opportunities for insider threats 
are particularly high.
In fact, elevated opportunities may

Organizations are witnessing an increase 
in advanced persistent threats (APTs), 
which are known for their sophistication, 
stealth, and ability to infiltrate networks 
while remaining undetected for extended 
periods. The concern here lies in the 
juxtaposition, that although organizations 
report no unusual challenges with 
detecting and responding to incidents, 
theyre still succumbing to this high\-stakes 
jeopardy.
The increasing incidence of APTs points 
to a gap in overall security posture. 
Given that APTs often exploit zero\-day 
vulnerabilities or use social engineering 
tactics that can bypass traditional 
detection mechanisms, the scenario 
emphasizes the imperative of taking a 
proactive, rather than reactive, approach 
to security. It drives home the need for 
continuous monitoring, threat hunting, 
and implementing advanced security 
measures that can predict and prevent 
attacks before they occur. As discussed 
above, risk assessment might begin with a 
careful study of identity management.

on insufficient methods 
to safeguard sensitive 
information.
Of the organizations we surveyed, 50% 
conduct manual reviews to identify and 
classify sensitive data within the cloud, 
which is a concerning indicator of the 
state of data security. Manual reviews are 
time\-consuming, error\-prone, and often 
incomplete, leaving organizations vulnerable 
to data breaches. Sixty\-four percent of 
respondents report an increase in data 
breaches over the last 12 months. 
With 98% of organizations storing 
sensitive data across multiple locations
on\-prem servers, the public cloud, in 
SaaS applications with local storage, on 
private clouds hosted by third parties, 
and endpointswe know that security 
challenges are high. 
The State of Cloud\-Native Security29
Data spread across multiple locations is 
difficult to track and protect. Security teams 
need a deep understanding of the controls 
and configurations for each environment, 
as well as the ability to coordinate security 
efforts across multiple teams. Management is 
complex and time\-consuming, which we see 
reflected in the top data security challenges.

What Would 
You Do 
Differently?
Hindsight offers 2020 
insights for improved
cloud migration.
When organizations recall migrating to the 
cloud for the first time, hindsight reveals 
areas where they could have approached 
the process differently to mitigate risks and 
enhance efficiency. 
By exploring these insights, we gain a 
collective experiencea blend of strategic 
planning, security focus, technical 
adaptation, and market research, each 
contributing to a more effective and secure 
cloud migration process.

Refactoring Applications 
Half of survey participants (50%) suggest 
spending more time on refactoring 
applications rather than migrating them 
with minimal changes. This strategy involves 
reimagining how applications are architected 
and developed to fully leverage cloud\-native 
features and services, which can significantly 
improve scalability, performance, and 
cost\-efficiency. Survey responses portray a 
balanced view across organizational roles, 
highlighting its value in enhancing application 
readiness for the cloud environment.
Establishing a Governance 
Framework
A significant 53% of respondents stress the 
importance of investing in a governance 
framework to manage cloud resources. 
This is something weve heard from our 
customers, with some referring to their early 
days in the cloud as the wild, wild West. By 
defining clear roles, policies, and processes, 
organizations can ensure resources are 
used efficiently and securely. Establishing 
such a framework from the outset provides 
a structured environment that can adapt to 
changes and scale with the organization. Its 
noteworthy that this perspective is valued 
across executive and practitioner levels, 
emphasizing its relevance.
Organizations are 
rethinking their 
strategies, with 
many emphasizing 
the need for

Prioritizing Security and Compliance
Reflecting an understanding that security 
in the cloud is fundamentally different from 
traditional on\-premises security, 50% of 
respondents advocate for prioritizing security 
and compliance from the beginning of the 
cloud migration process. By embedding 
security and compliance considerations into 
the migration strategy, organizations can 
avoid pitfalls that lead to vulnerabilities, data 
breaches, and noncompliance penalties. 
This approach is emphasized by information 
security and IT departments, underlining their 
focus on safeguarding organizational assets. 
Regionally, its particularly important to Latin 
American organizations (57%).
Researching Tools and Vendors 
Another 48% of respondents stress the 
importance of dedicating more time to 
researching tools and vendors. This insight 
underscores the complexity and diversity of 
the cloud services market, where the right 
tools and partnerships can dramatically 
influence the success of cloud adoption. By 
thoroughly evaluating options, organizations 
can select solutions that best fit their needs, 
budget, and strategic goals. This perspective 
is particularly valued by those in DevOps 
roles, reflecting their direct involvement in 
implementing and utilizing these tools.

The Human 
Factor
Security processes trigger 
delays, stress, and DevOps\-
SecOps conflict, suggesting 
the need for a people\-
first approach to secure 
application development.
Conflict between cloud security and 
application development is nothing new. 
Like complexity in the cloud and the drive 
to lessen it, the strife between those who 
build and those who secure persists. 
Although we see little progress on this 
front, participants in this years State of 
Cloud\-Native Security survey give us a 
closer look at the challengesand maybe 
even a glimpse at the solution. 
The most telling data point, 
or at least a good place to 
begin exploring the issue, is 
that 84% of respondents
an overwhelming majority
say that security processes 
cause delays to their project 
timelines. 
This likely factors into why 83% view 
security processes as a burden. Another 
79% say their employees frequently 
ignore or work\-around security processes. 
And still another 71% admit they dont 
understand their security responsibilities.
The State of Cloud\-Native Security35
How do these data points play out for the 
94% of organizations with cloud security 
professionals embedded in their cloud 
DevOps teams? The defense strategy, 
for many, involves a myriad of tickets 
generated by security for developers to 
resolve. At best, this is unsustainable. At 
worst, its a source of missed deadlines, 
inefficiencies, vulnerabilities in runtime, 
and team stress. 
Developers are organizationally pushed to 
create code, innovate, and deliver features 
with revenue potential. Tickets, in other 
words, tend to accumulate, creating a 
backlog of security issues. And heres 
where most go\-to\-market dates are missed, 
perpetuating a culture of scapegoating. 
Stress levels are palpable, with 71% of 
respondents saying not only are they 
stressed, but also their teammates are 
stressed. Turnover rates are predictably 
high, according to 93% of respondents.
92% of organizations attribute 
conflicting priorities between DevOps 
and SecOps teams to inefficient 
development and deployment.
Security is seen as a gating factor 
hindering software releases for 
86% of respondents. Meanwhile, 
91% say that developers need to 
produce more secure code.

As leadership considers workplace morale, 
they need to understand how organizational 
conflict and misaligned procedures contribute 
to itas well as how it erodes performance.
The cultural emphasis on productivity 
appears to undermine productivity, as it 
ultimately becomes both the catalyst of 
conflict and the casualty of conflict.
An overwhelming 92% of respondents agree 
that conflicting priorities for DevOps and

Strategies
Organizations seek 
efficient security tools with 
automation, centralized 
visibility, and easy\-to\-use 
features to reduce blind spots 
and streamline operations.
Tooling issues significantly contribute 
to delays in resolving security bugs and 
vulnerabilities, affecting the development 
process for 40% of survey respondents. 
One in 3 security practitioners attribute 
legacy security tools to their inability to 
stay on top of threat vectors. Nearly 2 in 5 
(38%) say alert noise contributes to delays.
Managing security in a multicloud 
environment is challenging. It requires 
a highly detailed, big\-picture strategy 
that includes seamless visibility into 
all cloud assets, consistent security

When it comes to tooling, the overarching 
theme from 2024 respondents is a move 
toward efficiency and effectiveness. 
Organizations are recognizing the 
importance of streamlining operations
not just for cost management but as a key 
component of an effective security posture.
For 91% of respondents, the number of 
point tools used creates blind spots that 
affect their abilities to prioritize risk and 
prevent threats. An acute awareness 
of the impact of tool sprawl has 98% 
of respondents wanting to reduce the 
number of cloud security tools in use.
But 88% of organizations struggle to 
identify what security tools they need. This 
population has increased considerably 
from last year, suggesting that goals to 
consolidate have been baffled by the 
proliferation of discrete tooling options. 
Teams do, however, know what 
capabilities they need. Ninety\-four percent 
want a solution that provides immediate 
remediation steps. Nearly as many (93%) 
agree that their organization would 
benefit from a solution that automatically 
finds interconnected vulnerabilities 
and misconfigurations with the highest 
potential of a successful attack.

Cloud\-native security 
in 2024 requires 
a comprehensive, 
multifaceted approach 
with strategic attention on 
longstanding challenges 
and emerging risks. 
Researchers at Palo 
Alto Networks suggest 
prioritizing five key areas.
Recommendations for 
Securing the Cloud
Consolidation with 
Platformization
Consider using a centralized security 
management platform that will follow 
you on your journey to cloud maturity and 
protect your applications and data end to 
end. As organizations expand their cloud 
and diversify their architecture usage, a 
holistic, architecture\-agnostic approach 
to cloud security becomes essential for 
optimal visibility, control, and automation. 
A strategic way to prepare for new 
cloud security requirements is to 
start with a platform vendor that can 
expand into your future use cases, 
encompassing both application and 
operations security. In this way, your 
security teams can quickly respond 
to new requirements, reduce training 
costs, and greatly simplify integration of 
new security capabilities. 
The State of Cloud\-Native Security44
Adopting AI Securely
AI is playing a tremendous and 
quickly growing role in application 
developmentincluding GenAI\-
accelerated code development, 
corporate data used as training data, 
and applications leveraging newly 
trained AI models. 
These trends heighten cloud 
security challenges. Because
AI\-generated code can lead to
faster proliferation of 
misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, 
and bugs, be sure to regulate
AI usage.
Protect your software supply chains 
and enable your developers to raise 
their code security posture ahead of 
their applications reaching production. 
Automate sensitive data discovery to 
ensure that sensitive data isnt used in 
model training. 
Applications written to leverage these 
models also need to be protected. 
Make sure policies and secure 
development environments are in place 
for your developers, including your AI 
developers, so your security teams 
arent starting from behind.

Intelligent Data Security
Implement a data security strategy 
that defines how sensitive data will 
be protected, regardless of where its 
stored. The strategy should include 
measures to encrypt data, control 
access to data, and monitor data for 
suspicious activity. Policies should be 
enforced through technical controls and 
regular security audits.
Invest in an automated data discovery 
and classification solution. Data security 
posture management (DSPM) with 
data detection and response (DDR) 
can scan large volumes of data quickly 
and accurately, including data stored 
in unstructured formats, such as text 
documents and images. Choose cloud 
security tools that include a large 
number of global best practices and 
compliance reporting out of the box. 
This will prepare your security team for 
new audit requirements that appear 
quickly from innovative businesses.
Regularly review and update data security 
measures to ensure they effectively 
address the evolving threat landscape, 
and train employees on data security best 
practices. Employees need to be aware 
of the risks of data breaches and how to 
protect sensitive data. Security teams 
should provide training on data security 
best practices and regularly remind 
employees of these practices.

Install Proactive Security 
Measures
Appreciate that security and 
development teams have different 
workflows and performance metrics. 
Each camp targets a unique agenda 
and approaches it from a unique 
perspective. Although both teams 
work to support the organization, they 
often work in opposition. If you dont 
deliberately, strategically, 100% commit 
to building a DevSecOps culture, your 
business outcomes are at risk. 
Reduce Traffic Jams in Your
DevOps Pipeline
Evaluate your DevOps maturity and 
workflows. Regardless of how often 
you push code to production
daily, weekly, or monthlyobserve 
how frequently security becomes 
a gating factor. Understand the 
extent of vulnerability cleanup your 
software engineers must perform 
prior to releasing an application. 
For improved efficiency and reliable 
security, consider implementing a 
secure\-by\-design approach.
