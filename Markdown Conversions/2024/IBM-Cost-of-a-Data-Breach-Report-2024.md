Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024
Executive summary
IBMs annual Cost of a Data Breach Report provides IT, risk 
management and security leaders with timely, quantifiable 
evidence to guide them in their strategic decision\-making. It 
also helps them better manage their risk profiles and security 
investments. This years reportthe 19th of the seriesreflects 
changes caused by technological shifts, such as the rise of 
shadow data, which is data residing in unmanaged data sources, 
and the extent and costs of business disruption brought about by 
data breaches.
The reports researchconducted independently by Ponemon 
Institute and sponsored, analyzed and published by IBM
studied 604 organizations impacted by data breaches between 
March 2023 and February 2024\. Researchers looked at 
organizations across 17 industries, in 16 countries and regions, 
and breaches that ranged from 2,100 to 113,000 compromised 
records. To gain on\-the\-ground insights, Ponemon Institute 
researchers interviewed 3,556 security and C\-suite business 
leaders with firsthand knowledge of the data breach incidents
at their organizations.

Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024
The result is a benchmark report that business and security 
leaders can use to strengthen their security defenses and drive 
innovation, particularly around the adoption of AI in security and 
security for their generative AI (gen AI) initiatives. 
We lead this years report with 2 major developments. First, the 
global average cost of a data breach increased 10% over the 
previous year, reaching USD 4\.88 million, the biggest jump since 
the pandemic. Business disruption and post\-breach customer 
support and remediation drove this cost spike. When asked how 
theyre dealing with these costs, more than half of organizations 
said they are passing them on to customers. Having customers 
absorb these costs can be problematic in a competitive market 
already facing pricing pressures from inflation.
Second, on the defender side of the equation, researchers also 
found applying security AI and automation is paying off, lowering 
breach costs in some instances by an average of USD 2\.2 million. 
AI and automation solutions are reducing the lifespan needed 
to identify and contain a breach and its resulting damage. Put 
another way, defenders without AI and automation to assist 
them can expect to take longer to detect and contain a breach, 
and see costs rise compared to those who use these solutions.
As weve seen across the industry, cybersecurity teams are 
consistently understaffed. This years study found more than 
half of breached organizations faced severe security staffing 
shortages, a skills gap that increased by double digits from the 
previous year. This lack of trained security staff is growing as the 
threat landscape widens. The continuing race to adopt gen AI 
across nearly every function in the organization is expected to 
bring with it unprecedented risks and put even more pressure on 
these cybersecurity teams. 
This report provides insights and recommendations from the 
research to help reduce the potential financial and reputational 
damages from a data breach.
Whats new in the 2024 report
Each year, we continue to evolve the Cost of a Data Breach 
Report to reflect new technologies, emerging tactics and recent 
events. For the first time, this years research explores: Whether organizations experienced long\-term operational 
disruption, for example, the inability to process sales orders, 
a complete shutdown of production facilities, ineffective 
customer services Whether the breach included data stored in unmanaged data 
sources, otherwise known as shadow data To what extent organizations are using AI and automation in 
each of 4 areas of security operations: prevention, detection, 
investigation and response The nature of extortion attacks, for example, extortion and 
ransomware attacks or extortion and data exfiltration only The time it takes to restore data, systems or services to their 
pre\-breach state How long it took organizations to report the breach if they 
were mandated to do so Whether organizations that involved law enforcement 
following a ransomware attack paid the ransom

Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024
Key findings
The key findings described here are based on IBM analysis of 
research data compiled by Ponemon Institute. 
Average total cost of a breach
The average cost of a data breach jumped to USD 4\.88 million 
from USD 4\.45 million in 2023, a 10% spike and the highest 
increase since the pandemic. A rise in the cost of lost business, 
including operational downtime and lost customers, and the cost 
of post\-breach responses, such as staffing customer service help 
desks and paying higher regulatory fines, drove this increase. 
Taken together, these costs totaled USD 2\.8 million, the highest 
combined amount for lost business and post\-breach activities 
over the past 6 years.
Cost savings from extensive use of AI in prevention
2 out of 3 organizations studied stated theyre deploying security 
AI and automation across their security operations center, a 
10% jump from the prior year. When deployed extensively across 
prevention workflowsattack surface management (ASM), red\-
teaming and posture managementorganizations averaged USD 
2\.2 million less in breach costs compared to those with no AI use 
in prevention workflows. This finding was the largest cost savings 
revealed in the 2024 report.
Growth of the cyber skills shortage
More than half of breached organizations are facing high
levels of security staffing shortages. This issue represents 
a 26\.2% increase from the prior year, a situation that 
corresponded to an average USD 1\.76 million more in breach 
costs. Even as 1 in 5 organizations say they used some form
of gen AI security toolswhich are expected to help close the 
gap by boosting productivity and efficiencythis skills gap 
remains a challenge.

292
Days to identify and contain breaches involving
stolen credentials
Breaches involving stolen or compromised credentials took the 
longest to identify and contain (292 days) of any attack vector. 
Similar attacks that involved taking advantage of employees and 
employee access also took a long time to resolve. For example, 
phishing attacks lasted an average of 261 days, while social 
engineering attacks took an average of 257 days.
46%
Share of breaches involving customer personal data
Nearly half of all breaches involved customer personal 
identifiable information (PII), which can include tax identification 
(ID) numbers, emails, phone numbers and home addresses. 
Intellectual property (IP) records came in a close second (43% 
of breaches). The cost of IP records jumped considerably from 
last year, to USD 173 per record in this years study from USD 
156 per record in last years report.
1 in 3
Share of breaches involving shadow data
35% of breaches involved shadow data, showing the 
proliferation of data is making it harder to track and safeguard. 
Shadow data theft correlated to a 16% greater cost of a breach. 
Researchers found storing data across environments proved to 
be a common storage strategy, accounting for 40% of breaches. 
These breaches also took longer to identify and contain. In 
contrast, data stored in just 1 type of environment was breached 
less often, whether that environment was public cloud (25%), on 
premises (20%) or private cloud (15%).
USD 830,000
Largest average cost increase among all industries
The industrial sector experienced the costliest increase of any 
industry, rising by an average USD 830,000 per breach over 
last year. This cost spike could reflect the need for industrial 
organizations to prepare for a more rapid response, as 
organizations in this sector are highly sensitive to operational 
downtime. Still, the time to identify and contain a data breach
at industrial organizations was above the median industry, at
199 days to identify and 73 days to contain.
USD 4\.99M
Average cost of a malicious insider attack
Compared to other vectors, malicious insider attacks resulted 
in the highest costs, averaging USD 4\.99 million. Among other 
expensive attack vectors were business email compromise, 
phishing, social engineering and stolen or compromised 
credentials. Gen AI may be playing a role in creating some of 
these phishing attacks. For example, gen AI makes it easier than 
ever for even non\-English speakers to produce grammatically 
correct and plausible phishing messages.
USD 1M
Cost savings when law enforcement is involved in
ransomware attacks
Ransomware victims that involved law enforcement ended up 
lowering the cost of the breach by an average of nearly USD 1 
million, and that excludes the cost of any ransom paid. Involving 
law enforcement also helped shorten the time required to 
identify and contain breaches from 297 days to 281 days.

Global highlights
Globally, security teams are doing a much better job of detecting 
and containing breaches, despite a stubborn skills shortage. 
More than half of breached organizations are facing security 
staffing shortages, and security leaders are, in turn, marshalling 
AI and automation solutions to close the skills gap. Despite their 
efforts, breach costs are rising, mostly from expenses related to 
business disruption and post\-breach responses. In the following 
section, we look at these issues and others, across industries, 
countries and regions, to provide security leaders with a view of 
the risks out there so you can learn from them.
The global average cost of a data breach spiked 
The global average cost of a data breach increased 10% in 
one year, reaching USD 4\.88 million, the biggest jump since 
the pandemic. Business disruption and post\-breach response 
activities drove most of this yearly cost increase. See Figure 1\.

The United States led the world in average breach cost
For the 14th year, the United States had the highest average 
data breach costUSD 9\.36 millionamong the 16 countries 
and regions studied. Rounding out the top 5 were the Middle 
East, Germany, Italy and Benelux. Benelux is the economic union 
of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and its a new 
addition this year. Notably, Canada and Japan saw average costs 
drop, while Italy and the Middle East saw significant increases.

Healthcare topped industry costs, again
The average breach cost for healthcare fell 10\.6%, to USD 9\.77 
million. But that factor wasnt enough to remove it from the 
top costliest industry for breachesa spot its held since 2011\. 
Healthcare remains a target for attackers since the industry often 
suffers from existing technologies and is highly vulnerable to 
disruption, which can put patient safety at stake. See Figure 3\.
Average time to identify and contain a breach fell
The mean time it took defenders to identity and contain a
breach dropped to 258 days, reaching a 7\-year low, compared 
to 277 days the previous year. Note: this global average of 
mean time to identify (MTTI) and mean time to contain (MTTC) 
excludes Benelux because, as a new region in the study, it was 
having outsized influence and skewed results much more than 
the average. See Figure 4\.

Lost business costs and post\-breach response costs soared
Costs from lost business and post\-breach response rose nearly 
11% over the previous year, which contributed to the significant 
rise in overall breach costs. Lost business costs include revenue 
loss due to system downtime, and the cost of lost customers and 
reputation damage. Post\-breach costs can include the expense 
of setting up call centers and credit monitoring services for 
impacted customers, and paying regulatory fines. See Figure 5\.

Most breaches involved customer PII
The most common type of data stolen or compromised was 
customer PII, at 46%. PII can include tax ID numbers, emails 
and home addresses, and can be used in identity theft and credit 
card fraud. The global average for all stolen record types rose to 
a high of USD 169, with employee PII the costliest. See Figures

Initial attack vectors and root causes
For the 2nd year in a row, phishing and stolen or compromised 
credentials were the 2 most prevalent attack vectors. Both also 
ranked among the top 4 costliest incident types. In addition to 
identifying the most common root causes for breaches, the study 
compared the average cost for each category, as well as the 
average time to identify and contain those breaches.
Compromised credentials topped initial attack vectors 
Using compromised credentials benefited attackers in 16% of 
breaches. Compromised credential attacks can also be costly 
for organizations, accounting for an average USD 4\.81 million 
per breach. Phishing came in a close second, at 15% of attack 
vectors, but in the end cost more, at USD 4\.88 million. Malicious 
insider attacks cost the most, at USD 4\.99 million, but were only 
7% of all breach pathways. See Figure 7\.

Credential\-based attacks took longer to identify and contain
Whether credentials were stolen or used by malicious insiders, 
attack identification and containment time increased, yielding 
an average combined time of 292 and 287 days respectively. 
Defenders needed to distinguish between legitimate and 
malicious user activity on the network, making threats harder to 
identify. On the other hand, attacks using zero\-day vulnerabilities 
were the most time\-consuming to contain. See Figure 8\.
IT failures or human error caused nearly half of all breaches
Malicious attacksthose committed by outside attackers or 
criminal insidersmade up 55% of all breaches. As concerning 
as these breaches are, its important to remember the remaining 
23% are due to IT failure and 22% are due to human error.See 
Figure 9\.
Data breach lifecycle
In a data breach, time means money, and breaches with longer 
lifecycles were more costly, according to our 2024 and 2023 
research. A complete breach lifecycle is the combination of the 
average number of days to identify and contain a breach. In both 
reports, we compared the average costs of data breaches where 
the complete breach lifecycle was under 200 days to the average 
cost of breaches where complete lifecycles exceeded 200 days. 
Longer breach lifecycles led to higher costs 
In this years report, researchers found data breaches with a 
lifecycle exceeding 200 days had the highest average cost, at 
USD 5\.46 million, compared to breaches with lifecycles under 
200 days. These findings are consistent with those from the 
previous year. Notably, while costs for longer data breach 
lifecycles increased 10\.3% this year over last year, costs for 
shorter lifecycles also increased, but by a smaller amount, 3\.6%.

Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024
Identifying the breach
To contain a data breach, it needs to be identified first. Who 
identifies it, and how quickly, make a difference in the resulting 
data breach costs. This year, we found security teams working 
with their own tools improved their performance in this area. In 
other cases, breaches were identified by benign third parties, 
such as security researchers, law enforcement and consultants, 
or the attackers themselves.
Security teams identified most breaches
Security teams and their tools detected breaches far more often, 
at 42% of the time, than did benign third parties, at 34%, and 
attackers themselves, at 24%. This figure was an improvement 
over the 2023 report when security teams discovered breaches 
only one\-third of the time. The change shows security teams 
were able to speed up detection. See Figure 11\.

Breaches disclosed by attackers cost more
By the time an attacker discloses a breach, theyll likely have 
already achieved their objective and done considerable damage, 
raising the overall costs of the breach. When a breach was 
disclosed by an attacker, the average cost was USD 5\.53 million. 
On the other hand, when a security team identified a breach, the 
average cost was USD 4\.55 million. See Figure 12\.
Faster breach identification and containment
The report found regardless of how a breach was discovered, 
organizations identified and contained them more quickly on 
average in 2024 than the previous year. The use of AI and 
automation likely contributed to this acceleration, as the next 
section of this report shows. See Figure 13\.

Security AI and automation
AI and automation are transforming the world of cybersecurity. 
They make it easier than ever for bad actors to create and launch 
attacks at scale and provide defenders with new tools for rapidly 
identifying threats and automating responses to those threats. 
This years report found these technologies accelerated the work 
of identifying and containing breaches and reducing costs.
AI and automation use grew
The number of organizations that used security AI and 
automation extensively grew to 31% in this years study from 
28% last year. Although its just a 3 percentage point difference, 
it represents a 10\.7% increase in use. The share of those using 
AI and automation on a limited basis also grew from 33% to 
36%, a 9\.1% increase. See Figure 14\.
More AI and automation meant lower breach costs
The more organizations used AI and automation, the lower their 
average breach costs. That correlation is striking and one of the 
key findings of this years report. Organizations not using AI and 
automation had average costs of USD 5\.72 million, while those 
making extensive use of AI and automation had average costs
of USD 3\.84 million, a savings of USD 1\.88 million. See Figure 15\.

More AI equaled faster identification and containment
Organizations extensively using security AI and automation 
identified and contained data breaches nearly 100 days faster
on average than organizations that didnt use these technologies 
at all. See Figure 16\.
Security teams applied AI and automation evenly
across functions
Among organizations that stated they used AI and automation 
extensively, about 27% used AI extensively in each of these 
categories: prevention, detection, investigation and response. 
Roughly 40% used AI technologies at least somewhat. See 
Figure 17\.

Extensive use of AI and automation lowered costs
When AI and automation were used extensively in each of the
4 areas of security, it dramatically lowered average breach costs 
compared to organizations that didnt use these technologies 
in those areas. For example, when organizations used AI and 
automation extensively for prevention, their average breach
cost was USD 3\.76 million. Meanwhile, organizations that didnt 
use these tools in prevention saw USD 5\.98 million in costs, a 
45\.6% difference. See Figure 18\.
AI and automation accelerated the time to identify and
contain a breach
Wherever AI and automation were applied, they accelerated the 
work of identifying and containing breaches. Extensive use of AI 
and automation in any security functionprevention, detection, 
investigation or responsereduced the average MTTI and MTTC 
for data breaches by 33% for response and 43% for prevention.

Raising prices post\-breach
By their nature, data breaches are expensive. When 
organizations find themselves saddled with multimillion\-dollar 
costs, they may look to recoup those costs elsewhere. One 
option is to pass them along to their own customers in the form 
of price hikes, which is an increasing trend. Raising prices can be 
risky in a market already facing pricing pressure.
Organizations passed breach costs to customers
Most organizations said they planned to increase prices of goods 
and services following a data breach, passing costs along to 
customers. The share of organizations that planned to do so 
increased to 63% this year from 57% last year, representing a 
10\.5% increase. See Figure 20\.
Business disruption
Business runs on data. When data is breached, business is 
disrupted. These disruptions can vary from small breaches that 
affect only a few systems to long\-lasting, organization\-wide, 
operational shutdowns. Our research explored how minor or 
significant those disruptions were, and how the severity of a 
disruption correlated with data breach costs.
Business disruption was substantial
70% of organizations in this years study experienced a 
significant or very significant disruption to business resulting 
from a breach. Only 1% described their level of disruption as low. 
See Figure 21\.

Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024
Average cost of a breach increased with disruption
Average breach costs were higher when business disruption was 
greater. Even organizations that reported low levels of disruption 
incurred average data breach costs of USD 4\.63 million. For 
organizations that reported very significant disruptions, average 
costs were 7\.9% higher, at USD 5\.01 million. See Figure 22\.
Recovery time
Even after a breach is contained, the work of recovery goes on. 
In this study, recovery means: Business operations are back to normal in areas affected by 
the breach. Organizations have met compliance obligations, such as 
paying fines. Customer confidence and employee trust have been restored. Organizations have put controls, technologies and expertise in 
place to avoid future data breaches.
Much of this work, such as re\-establishing customer confidence, 
involves factors beyond technology. For most organizations, the 
hard work of recovery can be months away.
Breach recovery rates were low
Only 12% of organizations queried during this years report 
said they had fully recovered from their data breaches. Most 
organizations said they were still working on them. See
Figure 23\.

Full recovery took longer than 100 days 
Among the share of organizations that had fully recovered, 
more than three\-quarters said they took longer than 100 
days. Recovery is a protracted process. Roughly one\-third of 
organizations that had fully recovered said they required more 
than 150 days to do so. A small share, 3%, of fully recovered 
organizations were able to do so in less than 50 days. See

Factors that decreased or increased the 
average breach cost
When analyzing costs, its helpful to know which technologies 
or events tend to lower or raise them. One constant we found: 
AI and automation lowers costs, while a high level of cyber 
skills shortage raises them. In this analysis, we looked at 28 
contributing factors. We examined the impact of each in isolation 
against the global average. We then looked at the top 3 factors 
found to amplify or mitigate the average data breach cost.
Key factors that reduced costs
Employee training and the use of AI and machine learning 
insights were the top factors mitigating average data breach 
costs in this analysis. Employee training continues to be an 
essential element in cyberdefense strategies, specifically 
for detecting and stopping phishing attacks. AI and machine 
learning insights closely followed in second place. See Figure 25\.
Key factors that increased costs
The top 3 factors that amplified breach costs in this analysis 
were security system complexity, security skills shortage and 
third\-party breaches, which can include supply chain breaches.

High versus low levels of key cost amplifying factors 
When organizations suffered from a high\-level shortage of 
security skills, average breach costs were USD 5\.74 million, 
compared to organizations with a low\-level skills shortage, with 
USD 3\.98 million. Similar disparities were seen across 2 other 
key cost factor areas. See Figure 27\.
High versus low levels of key cost mitigating factors
When organizations suffered from low levels of employee 
training, average breach costs were USD 5\.10 million, compared 
to organizations with high levels of employee training, with USD 
4\.15 million. Similar disparities were seen across 2 other key 
cost factor areas. See Figure 28\.

Security skills shortage
The number of organizations facing a critical lack of skilled 
security workers rose dramatically, to 53% in 2024 compared to 
42% last year. This years research found a strong link between 
the worsening skills shortage and higher data breach costs.
Skills shortage equated to higher breach costs
In 2024, the average cost of breaches associated with a high\-
level skills shortage jumped to USD 5\.74 million from USD 5\.36 
million last year, a 7\.1% rise. This increase was USD 860,000 
higher than the global average breach cost. See Figure 29\.
The cost of extortion attacks
The amount an organization spends on extortion attacks 
can vary based on typeransomware, data exfiltration and 
destructiveas well as the way the organization responds. This 
factor is particularly true if law enforcement is called in, as this 
years study shows, where costs dropped dramatically when law 
enforcement investigators were involved. All 3 types of attacks 
were examined, including ransomware, where data is encrypted 
and a ransom demanded; data exfiltration, where data is stolen 
and the organization sometimes extorted; and destructive, 
where attackers delete data and destroy systems for their own 
objectives.
Cost of destructive attacks outpaced other extortion
Destructive attacks, or those attacks that are intended to cause 
lasting and expensive damage, reached an average of USD 5\.68 
million, and proved more costly than either ransomware attacks 
or data exfiltration attacks. See Figure 30\.

When organizations fell victim to ransomware, 52% called in law 
enforcement. The majority of those that did, 63%, ended up not 
paying the ransom. See Figure 32\.

Average breach costs ranged from USD 4\.38 million with 
law enforcement involved to USD 5\.37 million without law 
enforcement, a cost difference of more than 20%, or nearly
USD 1 million. Note: those cost figures didnt include
ransom payments. See Figure 33\. Law enforcement involvement 
also sped up the time it took to identify and contain a breach.

Reporting the breach and regulatory fines
This years report found most organizations reported their 
breaches to regulators or other government agencies. About 
a third also paid fines. As a result, reporting and paying fines 
have become common parts of post\-breach responses. The 
study looked at the size of fines, as well as how long it took 
organizations to disclose the breach to regulators. Most 
organizations reported the breach within a few days.
Average breach reporting times
Over half of organizations reported their data breach in under
72 hours, while 34% took more than 72 hours to report. Just 
11% were not required to report the breach at all. See Figure 35\.
Amount of regulatory fines are rising
More organizations paid higher regulatory fines, with those 
paying more than USD 50,000, rising 22\.7% over last year,
and those paying more than USD 100,000, rising 19\.5%. See 
Figure 36\.

Data security
No matter where data is stored, it can be vulnerable to a breach. 
This years study shows some places are more vulnerable and 
costly per breach than others. Most breaches involved data 
distributed across multiple environments or public clouds. Both 
storage options were associated with longer breach lifecycles 
and higher breach costs.
Even as organizations expand and refine their data management 
strategies, they often overlook shadow datadata thats 
unmanaged and likely invisible to the IT department. It could 
be the result of workers sharing data through unauthorized 
applications or uploading it to unofficial cloud buckets. The 
report found when breaches involved shadow data, they lasted 
longer and led to greater costs. 
Cloud breaches
Breaches by data location
About 40% of all breaches involved data distributed across 
multiple environments, such as public clouds, private clouds and 
on premises. Fewer breaches in the study involved data stored 
solely in a public cloud, private cloud or on premises. With data 
becoming more dynamic and active across environments, its 
harder to discover, classify, track, and also secure. See Figure 37\. 
Breaches by location and cost
Data breaches solely involving public clouds were the most 
expensive type of data breach, costing USD 5\.17 million on 
average, a 13\.1% increase from last year. Breaches involving 
multiple environments were more common but slightly less 
expensive than public cloud breaches. On\-premises breaches 
were the least costly. See Figure 38\.

Centralized control related to faster remediation
The more centralized control organizations had over their data, 
the quicker on average they could identify and contain a breach. 
Breaches involving data stored solely on premises took an 
average of 224 days to identify and contain, 23\.3% less time 
than data distributed across environments, which took 283 
days. The same pattern of local control and shortened breach 
lifecycles showed up in the comparison between private cloud 
architectures and public cloud architectures. See Figure 39\.
Shadow data
Breach costs for shadow data
The average cost of a data breach involving shadow data was 
USD 5\.27 million, 16\.2% higher than the average cost without 
shadow data. See Figure 40\.

Breach lifecycles for shadow data
Breaches involving shadow data took 26\.2% longer on average 
to identify and 20\.2% longer on average to contain than those 
that didnt. These increases resulted in data breaches lasting an 
average lifecycle of 291 days, 24\.7% longer than data breaches 
without shadow data. See Figure 41\.
Shadow data across environments
While shadow data was found in every type of environment
public and private clouds, on premises and across multiple 
environments25% of breaches involving shadow data were 
solely on premises. That finding means shadow data isnt strictly 
a problem related to cloud storage. See Figure 42\.

Mega breaches
Mega breaches, characterized by more than 1 million 
compromised records, are relatively rare. Accordingly, the 
research treats them separately from most other breaches, 
partly so that they dont skew the analysis of more typical
data breaches. 
Mega breach costs rose
The average cost of all mega breach size categories was higher 
this year than last. The jump was most pronounced for the 
largest breaches, affecting between 50 million and 60 million 
records. The average cost increased by 13%, and these breaches 
were many times more expensive than a typical breach. For even 
the smallest mega breach1 million to 10 million recordsthe 
average cost was nearly 9 times the global average cost of USD

Security investments
When an organization is breached, its business and IT leaders 
often increase their security investments. This years study 
asked organizations about their plans for future security 
spending. Organizations were permitted to identify more than 1 
area of investment.
Share of organizations making security investments rose
Almost two\-thirds of organizations planned to increase security 
investments following a breach, a 23\.5% rise over last year. This 
rise may reflect a realization that breach costs related to lost 
business and regulatory fines continue to grow, along with the 
potential for reputational damage. See Figure 44\.
Popular areas of security investment
The 2 most popular areas of security investment reported 
this year were IR planning and testing, at 55%, and threat 
detection and response technologies, at 51%. The focus of the 
top 2 investment areas was on detecting suspicious incidents 
and threats and responding to them more quickly. Many 
organizations were also planning to invest in data security
and protection tools, at 34%, and IAM, at 42%. See Figure 45\.

Recommendations 
to help reduce the 
cost of a data breach
Our recommendations include successful security approaches 
that are associated with reduced costs and lower times to 
identify and contain breaches.
Know your information landscape
Most organizations distribute data across multiple environments, 
including on\-premises data repositories, private clouds and 
public clouds. However, many organizations have incomplete or 
out\-of\-date data inventories, delaying efforts to discover what 
data has been breached and how sensitive or confidential it is. 
These delays can complicate the response and raise the cost of 
a breach. 
Security teams should ensure they have comprehensive visibility 
into all these environments, so they can continuously monitor 
and protect data regardless of where it resides. Organizations 
can apply data security posture management (DSPM) and other 
35
Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024
Take a security\-first approach to
gen AI adoption
While organizations are moving quickly ahead with gen AI, 
only 24% of gen AI initiatives are being secured. The lack of 
security threatens to expose data and data models to breaches, 
potentially undermining the benefits that gen AI projects are 
intended to deliver. 
As gen AI adoption continues to scale, organizations need a 
framework for securing gen AI data, models and usage, along 
with establishing AI governance controls. Theyll need to secure 
the training data by protecting it from theft and manipulation. 
Organizations can use data discovery and classification to detect 
sensitive data used in training or fine\-tuning. They can also 
implement data security controls across encryption, access 
management and compliance monitoring.
With gen AI, not only are organizations faced with the risk of,
and growth in, shadow data, but also shadow models. 
Organizations must extend posture management to the AI 
models themselves to protect sensitive AI training data, gain 
visibility into the use of unsanctioned or shadow AI models,
and AI misuse or data leakage.
Securing gen AI model development requires scanning for 
vulnerabilities in the pipeline, hardening integrations, and 
enforcing policies and access. To secure the use of gen AI 
models requires security teams to monitor for malicious inputs, 
such as prompt injections, and outputs containing sensitive data. 
They must also deploy AI security solutions that can detect and 
respond to AI\-specific attacks, such as data poisoning, model 
evasion and model extraction. Developing response playbooks 
to deny access, and quarantine and disconnect compromised 
models is essential as well.
solutions, such as identity access management and ASM,
across all these environments for consistent and
comprehensive protection.
Security teams must pay extra attention to hybrid environments 
and public clouds. 40% of data breaches involved data stored 
across multiple environments, and when breached data was 
stored in public clouds, it incurred the highest average breach 
cost at USD 5\.17 million. Its imperative security teams gain a 
deeper understanding of the specific risks and controls for each 
cloud service they employ.
Managing data across environments becomes further 
complicated by the impact of unmanaged data. More than one\-
third of data breaches involve shadow data. Security teams must 
now assume their organizations have unmanaged data sources.
Unencrypted data, including data in AI workloads, further 
exacerbates the risk. Data encryption strategies must consider 
the types of data, its use and where it resides to lower risk in 
case of a breach.
Strengthen prevention strategies with
AI and automation
The adoption of gen AI models and third\-party applications 
across the organizationas well as the ongoing use of Internet 
of Things (IoT) devices and SaaS applicationsare expanding the 
attack surface, putting pressure on security teams.
Applying AI and automation that support security prevention 
strategiesincluding in the areas of ASM, red\-teaming and 
posture managementcan often be addressed by managed 
security services. Organizations that applied AI and automation 
to security prevention saw the biggest impact from their AI 
investments in this years study compared to 3 other security 
areas: detection, investigation and response. They saved an 
average of USD 2\.22 million over those organizations that didnt 
deploy AI in prevention technologies.

Level up your cyber response training 
How an organization reacts and communicates during and after 
a breachwith business leadership, regulators and customers
matters more than ever. To enhance their ability to handle high\-
impact attacks, organizations can build up their muscle memory 
for breach responses by participating in cyber range crisis 
simulation exercises. 
These exercises can include security teams as well as business 
leaders, so the entire organization improves its ability to detect, 
contain and respond to breaches. Security leaders should 
work with their business functions across the organization and 
communications teams ahead of time to draft response plans 
and test them. With threat landscapes expanding because of gen 
AI and other IT initiatives, security training needs to be offered 
to non\-security practitioners. These practitioners include data 
scientists and data engineers working in machine learning and AI 
teams and those tasked with continuity of AI workloads across 
on\-premises and cloud assets.
By investing in response preparedness, organizations can help 
reduce the costly, disruptive effects of data breaches, support 
operational continuity and help preserve their relationships 
with customers, partners and other key stakeholders. Moreover, 
rehearsed response reassures employees and reduces stress, 
distress and friction internally as the acute stages of an attack 
are handled, controlled and communicated by a well\-prepared 
leadership team.
With threat landscapes 
expanding because of gen AI 
and other IT initiatives, security 
training needs to be offered

Research 
methodology
To preserve confidentiality, the benchmark instrument didnt 
capture any company\-specific information. Data collection 
methods excluded actual accounting information and instead 
relied on participants estimating direct costs by marking a range 
variable on a number line. Participants were instructed to mark 
the number line in one spot between the lower and upper limits 
of a range for each cost category.
The numerical value obtained from the number line, rather than 
a point estimate for each presented cost category, preserved 
confidentiality and ensured a higher response rate. The 
benchmark instrument also required respondents to provide a 
second separate estimate for indirect and opportunity costs.
In the interest of maintaining a manageable dataset for 
benchmarking, the report included only those cost activity 
centers with a crucial impact on data breach costs. Based 
on discussions with experts, a fixed set of cost activities was 
chosen. After collecting benchmark information, each instrument 
was carefully reexamined for consistency and completeness.
The scope of data breach cost factors was limited to known 
categories that apply to a broad set of business operations 
involving personal information. We chose to focus on business 
processes instead of data protection or privacy compliance 
activities because we believed the process study would yield 
better\-quality results.

How we calculate the cost of a data 
breach
To calculate the average cost of a data breach, we excluded 
very small and very large breaches. Data breaches examined 
in the 2024 report ranged in size between 2,100 and 113,000 
compromised records. We used a separate analysis to examine 
the costs of mega breaches; that methodology is explained 
further in the Data breach FAQs section of this report.
We used activity\-based costing, which identifies activities 
and assigns a cost according to actual use. Four process\-
related activities drove a range of expenditures associated 
with an organizations data breach: detection and escalation, 
notification, post\-breach response and lost business.
Detection and escalation
Activities that enable an organization to detect the
breach include: Forensic and investigative activities Assessment and audit services Crisis management Communications to executives and boards
Notification
Activities that enable an organization to notify data subjects, 
data protection regulators and other third parties include: Emails, letters, outbound calls or general notices to data 
subjects Determination of regulatory requirements Communication with regulators Engagement of outside experts
Post\-breach response
Activities to help victims of a breach communicate with an 
organization and conduct redress activities to victims and 
regulators include: Help desk and inbound communications Credit monitoring and identity protection services Issuing of new accounts or credit cards Legal expenditures Product discounts Regulatory fines
Lost business
Activities that attempt to minimize the loss of customers, 
business disruption and revenue losses include: Business disruption and revenue losses due to system 
downtime Cost of losing customers and acquiring new customers Reputational damage and diminished goodwill

Data breach FAQs
Whats a data breach?
A data breach is defined as an event in which records containing 
PII; financial or medical account details; or other secret, 
confidential or proprietary data are potentially put at risk.
These records can be in electronic or paper format. Breaches 
included in the study ranged between 2,100 and 113,000 
compromised records.
Whats a compromised record?
A record is information that reveals confidential or proprietary 
corporate, governmental or financial data, or identifies an 
individual whose information has been lost or stolen in a data 
breach. Examples include a database with an individuals name, 
credit card information and other PII, or a health record with the 
policyholders name and payment information.
How do you collect the data?
Our researchers collected in\-depth qualitative data over 3,556 
separate interviews with individuals at 604 organizations that 
suffered a data breach between March 2023 and February 2024\. 
Interviewees were familiar with their organizations data breach 
and the costs associated with resolving the breach. These 
interviewees included CEOs or executives, heads of operations, 
controllers or heads of finance, IT practitioners, business unit 
leaders and general managers, and risk management and 
cybersecurity practitioners. For privacy purposes, we didnt 
collect organization\-specific information.
Whats included in the cost of a data breach?
We collected both the direct and indirect expenses incurred by 
the organization. Direct expenses included engaging forensic 
experts, outsourcing hotline support and providing free credit 
monitoring subscriptions and discounts for future products
and services. Indirect costs included in\-house investigations
and communications along with the extrapolated value of 
customer loss resulting from turnover or diminished customer 
acquisition rates.
This research represented only events directly relevant to the 
data breach experience. Regulations, such as the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer 
Privacy Act (CCPA), may encourage organizations to increase 
investments in their cybersecurity governance technologies. 
However, such activities didnt directly affect the cost of a data 
breach for this research. For consistency with prior years, we 
used the same currency translation method rather than adjusting 
accounting costs.
How does benchmark research differ from survey research?
The unit of analysis in the Cost of a Data Breach Report was 
the organization. In survey research, the unit of analysis is the 
individual. We recruited 604 organizations to participate in
this study.
Can the average per\-record cost be used to calculate the cost 
of breaches involving millions of lost or stolen records?
Its not consistent with this research to use the overall cost per 
record as a basis for calculating the cost of single or multiple 
breaches totaling millions of records. The per\-record cost is 
derived from our study of hundreds of data breach events in 
which each event featured a maximum of 113,000 compromised 
records. To measure the impact of mega breaches that involve 
1 million or more records, the study instead uses a simulation 
framework based on a sample of 17 events of that size.
Why did you use simulation methods to estimate the cost of a 
mega data breach?
The sample size of 17 organizations that experienced a mega 
breach was not large enough to support a statistically significant 
analysis using the studys activity\-based cost methods. To 
remedy this issue, we deployed Monte Carlo simulations to 
estimate a range of possible, meaning random, outcomes 
through repeated trials. In total, we performed more than 
269,000 trials. The grand mean of all sample means provided a 
most likely outcome at each size of data breach, ranging from 1 
million to 53 million compromised records.
Are you tracking the same organizations each year?
Each annual study involves a different sample of organizations. 
To be consistent with previous reports, we recruit and match 
organizations each year with similar characteristics, such as the 
organizations industry, head count, geographic footprint and 
size of data breach. Since starting this research in 2005, we have 
studied the data breach experiences of 6,184 organizations.

Research limitations
Our study used a confidential and proprietary benchmark 
method that was successfully deployed in earlier research. 
However, the inherent limitations with this benchmark research 
need to be carefully considered before drawing conclusions
from findings.
Nonstatistical results
Our study drew upon a representative, nonstatistical sample 
of global entities. Statistical inferences, margins of error and 
confidence intervals cant be applied to this data, given that our 
sampling methods werent scientific.
Nonresponse
Nonresponse bias wasnt tested, so its possible that 
organizations that didnt participate are substantially different
in terms of underlying data breach cost.
Sampling\-frame bias
Because our sampling frame was judgmental, the quality
of results was influenced by the degree to which the frame
was representative of the population of organizations being 
studied. We believe the current sampling frame was biased 
toward organizations with more mature privacy or information 
security programs.
Organization\-specific information
The benchmark didnt capture organization\-identifying 
information. Individuals could use categorical response variables 
to disclose demographic information about the organization and 
industry category.
Unmeasured factors
We omitted variables from our analyses, such as leading trends 
and organizational characteristics. The extent to which omitted 
variables might explain benchmark results cant be determined.
Extrapolated cost results
Although certain checks and balances can be incorporated into 
the benchmark process, its always possible respondents didnt 
provide accurate or truthful responses. In addition, the use of 
cost extrapolation methods rather than actual cost data may 
inadvertently introduce bias and inaccuracies.
Currency conversions
The conversion from local currencies to the US dollar deflated 
average total cost estimates in other countries. For purposes 
of consistency with prior years, we decided to continue to use 
the same accounting method rather than adjust the cost. Its 
important to note this issue may affect only the global analysis 
because all country\-level results are shown in local currencies.
