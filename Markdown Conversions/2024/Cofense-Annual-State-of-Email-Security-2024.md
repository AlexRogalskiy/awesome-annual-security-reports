The DetailsTHE CYBERSECURITY LANDSCAPE IS ALWAYS EVOLVING, so it is imperative to stay on 
top of the latest trends and tactics. To learn more about what our intelligence revealed, 
heres a deep dive into the email security trends you need to stay on top of in 2024\.Credential Theft Phishing Leads
as Top Threat VectorAs we look to the future of cyber threats, its clearthat credential phishing will remain a top concern .The Cofense team identified that 91% of activethreatreports published in 2023 centered aroundcredential phishing, a 67% increase in volumecompared to the year prior .This sophisticated form of attack often involvesconvincing individuals to give up their logininformation or other sensitive data, which can then beused to gain access to secure systems and networks .Cofense reported a 67% 
increase in credential 
theft phishing volume 
over 2022\.
Cofense IntelligenceNot only can credential phishing lead to devastating ransomware attacks and data breaches, but it can also pave the way forbusiness email compromise (BEC) schemes that defraud companies out of millions of dollars . As we move into 2024 and beyond,organizations must take this threat seriously and work to implement robust security protocols that can protect against all formsof credential phishing like vishing, smishing, QR code phishing, and other dangerous cyber\-attacks .Use of QR Codes in Phishing Campaigns 
isRapidly IncreasingQR codes in the phishing threat landscape are a major topic of interest and worthpaying close attention to . QR codes change the attack vector and enable threatactors to trick victims into using their smartphones, which are typically not protectedby enterprise controls and are therefore more vulnerable . Over the last year,Cofense reported a 331% increase in QR code ATRs issued .As campaigns using QR codes grow in size and complexity, it is importantto track not just the QR codes themselves, but also the context of the emailsQR codes in the phishing 
threat landscape are a 
major topic of interest 
and worth paying close 
attention to.2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report10delivering the QR codes. Some of the emails bearing QR codes are delivered in attached fileslike HTM, PDFs, or Word documents . Others use images embedded in the email or QR codesrendered from external sources . The more recent QR code campaigns utilize a wide range ofemail themes rather than the earlier campaigns that primarily used multi\-factor authenticationas a lure for victims .When it comes to the URLs from the actual QR codes, there are many differentcharacteristics, such as their purpose as a legitimate redirect, a link shortener, etc . or thefact that one of the redirect pages makes use of a Cloudflare CAPTCHA.The most common characteristics associated with URLs embedded in QR codes wereCAPTCHA, multi\-factor authentication (MFA), and URLs that had an open redirect to acredential phishing page .The most common sources of QR codes are either a code embedded in the email content oran attached .pdf, .htm, or .doc file.The subject of QR code emails was likely to be MFA themed, containing date and personallyidentifiable information that was redacted.The types of URL domains embedded in QR codes were malicious or compromised,legitimate, QR code related, and a standard link shortener service .Legitimate domains of URLs embedded in QR codes were Bing, Google, Baidu, and 5 otherminor sources .Cofense 
reported 
a 331% 
increase in 
QR Code 
Active Threat

issued.
Cofense IntelligenceCofense was the first to alert the market about this growing threat early in 2023 and in Q4 2023, announced a first\-of\-its\-kindsolution that provides world\-class security awareness training (SAT) and threat detection \& response capabilities to specificallytarget QR code phishing threats .Threat Actors Lure Victims with Brand 
Impersonation and Vishing CampaignsBrand impersonation and vishing campaigns are techniques used by threat actors to deceive victims into clicking on maliciouslinks or providing sensitive information . In brand impersonation attacks, cybercriminals use the name, logo, and other brandingelements of a reputable company to trick victims into believingthe communication is legitimate . Once they gain the trust oftheir victims, they exploit this relationship to carry out theirmalicious activities .Vishing campaigns, on the other hand, often start withemail but involve using voice calls or automated phonemessages to manipulate victims into providing confidentialinformation . The attackers may pose as representatives ofa trusted organization or financial institution and use socialengineering tactics to gain access to personal data such aslogin credentials or credit card numbers . Vishing attacks arebecoming increasingly popular due to the ease of accessingpersonal information through phone numbers and thewidespread use of smartphones .Brand Impersonation: 
Cybercriminals use the name, logo,and other branding elements of a 
reputable company to trick victims into 
believing the communication is legitimate .Vishing: Often start with email, 
andthen voice calls or automatedphone messages to manipulate victims 
into providing confidential information.2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report11Cofense saw both of these tactics on the rise in 2023\. Both vishing and brand impersonation tactics are very efficient atbypassing SEGs; they are often delivered without attachments or obvious links making it difficult for traditional file and text\-based detection software to pick up on these forms of phishing . Additionally, because users interact with these tactics vianon\-traditional methods like personal smartphones and traditional telephones, these types of phishing take users outside theprotections of their corporate environment and its security protocols .We believe that the best way to secure your organization from these types of attacks is to implement acomplete end\-to\-end email security solution. We recommend a holistic solution that combines SecurityAwareness Training and Threat Detection and Response to identify malicious threats quickly and stopthem before they become detrimental to your companys data security while conditioning your employees toidentify and report these types of malicious attacks. In 2023, Cofense introduced new simulation training toits SAT offering specifically focused on vishing and brand impersonation phishing tactics.Malware Tactics Continue to Evolve

Since then, the campaign has evolved and is using evasive tacticsand anti\-analysis techniques to continue distributing DarkGate, and more recently, PikaBot malware .The campaign surged just one month after the last instance of QakBot activity and follows the same trends used by theinfamous threat actors that deployed the QakBot malware and botnet . This campaign disseminates a high volume of emailsto a wide range of industries, and due to the loader capabilities of the malware delivered, targets can be at risk of moresophisticated threats like reconnaissance malware and ransomware .2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report12In August 2023, the FBI and the Justice Departmentannounced they had disabled the QakBot infrastructure . Sincethen, QakBot has remained silent, with no significant activityseen from the malware infrastructure . While direct attributionbetween the QakBot threat actors and the new DarkGatecampaign can be difficult, we can show the similarities betweenthe two . At the time of this report, Cofense is watching thisactivity closely as there is a chance the threat actors are usingthis time to regroup and return even stronger in the future .Starting with the timeline of the campaign, Cofense lastreported on QakBot at the end of June,whereas DarkGatereports first emerged during July. The new campaign that isdelivering DarkGate and PikaBot follows the same tactics thathave been used in QakBot phishing campaigns . These includehijacked email threads as the initial infection, URLs with uniquepatterns that limit user access, and an infection chain nearlyidentical to what we have seen with QakBot delivery . Themalware families used also follow suit to what we would expectQakBot affiliates to use. Along with many other capabilities,both malware families can act as loaders with the ability to addadditional malicious payloads to unknown infected machines .DarkGate was first seen in 2018 
and is capable of cryptocurrencymining, credential theft, ransomware, and 
remote access .PikaBot is a new malware family 
firstseen in 2023\. It is classified asaloader due to its ability to deliver 
additional malware payloads . It contains 
several evasive techniques to avoid 
sandboxes, virtual machines, and other 
debugging techniques .Timeline of Qakbot and DarkGatePikaBot Campaign\*First sighting ofPikaBot in the wild(ATR 322798\)First sighting of theDarkGate campaign(ATR 3335993\)Significant increasein volume for theDarkGate campaignMAY 2023JUNE 2023JULY 2023AUGUST 2023SEPTEMBER 2023OCTOBER 2023Last seenQakBot activity(ATR 329025\)FBI and JusticeDepartment announceQakBot takedownDarkGatecampaign swapsto PikaBot delivery(ATR 351404\)\*This data is based on Cofense Intelligence sightings .The observed DarkGatePikaBot campaign is a high\-level threat due to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) thatenable the phishing emails to reach intended targets and the advanced capabilities of the malware being delivered .During the campaign, Cofense identified several different infection chains, almost as if the threat actors were testing differentmalware delivery options. A favored infection chain to deliver the malware has been identified and follows in line with that seenin QakBot campaigns during May 2023 .2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report13The campaign began with a hijacked email thread to bait users into interacting with a URL that had added layers that limitedaccess to the malicious payload only to users that met specific requirements set by the threat actors (location and internetbrowser). This URL downloaded a ZIP archive that contained a JS file(JSDropper, which is a JavaScript application used to reachout to another URL to download and run malware) . At this stage, the user was successfully infected with either the DarkGate orPikaBot malware .MALWARE FAMILYEmotetGeodoEmotetGeodo may sound like names from a science fiction movie, but they represent one of the most destructive malwarecampaigns in recent years. This malware was first discovered in Europe in 2014, gained sophistication over time, and has spreadacross the globe, infecting countless computers and causing extensive damage to personal and professional networks .The FBI opened its first related investigation in 2017\. Duringtheir investigation, the FBI discovered that in some cases,malware was delivered as a banking trojan that recordedonline banking credentials and then stole from victimsaccounts . In other cases, Emotet allowed the installation ofmalware that enabled a ransomware attack .In 2021, law enforcement dismantled the foundationalcomponents of Emotets operation . The unprecedented effortclosed off access that had been maliciously opened on 1 .6million computers worldwide .Emotet was hit hard but like any other malicious campaignthe threat actors always seem to live to see another day . Longgaps in Emotet activity are common, often followed by surgesof malicious email dissemination .In 2023, Cofense researchers observed new activity in Emotetepochs 4 and 5 . Emotet uses several botnets called epochs,each of which is assigned its own command and control (C2\)infrastructure. In January, Cofense observed .dll file updatesbeing sent to each epoch, almost certainly configuring bots tocontact new infrastructure .Emotet, which is often partnered 
with Geodo, is known for its abilityto infiltrate and manipulate email 
accounts, tricking unsuspecting individuals 
into downloading infected files or clicking 
on malicious links .Geodo, on the other hand, operates 
as a botnet, creating a network ofinfected devices that work together to 
spread the virus even further .As predicted, after several months of inactivity, the Emotet botnet resumed email activity on March 7, 2023 . The maliciousemails seemed to be replying to already existing email chains, with the addition of an attached .zip file. The .zip files are notpassword protected and the themes of the attached files included finances and invoices.Given its history of success, EmotetGeodo poses a serious cybersecurity threat . We continue to encourage organizations tostay vigilant to avoid falling victim to this heinous threat .MALWARE FAMILYAgent TeslaThe world of cybersecurity can be a daunting and complex place, especially when it comes to malware . One such malwareis Agent Tesla, a keylogger written in.NET that can monitor keystrokes, take screenshots, steal passwords from a variety ofapplications, and exfiltrate this data back to the threat actor through common protocols, all while remaining undetected on theusers computer .Agent Tesla first appeared in 2014 and has been a staple in the malware landscape ever since. This keylogger was originallyadvertised on a Turkish website as a remote access tool to monitor your personal computer . It could compile your passwords,2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report14monitor your keystrokes, and avoid being caught by yourendpoints anti\-virus . The Agent Tesla Keylogger executableis typically delivered via a direct attachment to an email . Thechief exfiltration method over the past year remains SMTP butFTP, HTTP, Discord Webhooks, and Telegram are often seenas well .Agent Tesla has gone through a variety of upgrades overthe years . Besides changes intended to ensure that everynew release can bypass anti\-virus scans, it now advertisesthe ability to steal credentials from over 55 applicationsincludingweb browsers, VPN applications, FTP applications,and mail clients . It also continues to improve its ability tocircumvent or avoid sandbox technologies. While at firstit only used SMTP to communicate back to the attacker, itnow also supports communication over FTP, HTTP, DiscordWebhooks, and Telegram .Agent Tesla can steal credentials 
from over 55 applications includingweb browsers, VPN applications, FTP 
applications and mail clients . Cofense has 
seen phishing emails delivering Agent 
Tesla through both attachments and links 
bypassing the leading secure email 
gateways (SEGs) .Agent Tesla was originally sold as a remote access tool, and it could be argued that it functions no differently from legitimateremote access tools like GoToMyPC or LogMeIn . US prosecutors have successfully argued that someone selling and instructingusers how to install the product in ways that are arguably deceptive, has crossed the legal line and can be criminallyprosecuted under computer misuse laws . Other remote access tools have been sold in this manner and the sellers have beenprosecuted and sent to prison . Some developers explicitly included warnings to only use the product in a legal way in anattempt to avoid prosecution but this was not held up in court .Cofense has seen phishing emails delivering Agent Tesla through both attachments and links bypassing the leading SEGs .However, Agent Tesla keyloggers behavior on an endpoint should typically be detectable by modern endpoint security suitesand network activity monitors .As cybercriminal techniques continue to evolve, its important to stay informed and take the necessary steps to safeguard yourorganization against these persistent threats . Cofense can help; our Phishing Detection and Response (PDR) solution is uniquelypositioned to help you stop threats like these .MALWARE FAMILYFormBookFormBook consistently places in the Top 5 malware families most commonly seen by Cofense . FormBook is an information\-stealer type malware, primarily focused on accessing information about infected computers, as well as saved credentials orforms from browsers, applications, cryptocurrency wallets, and instant messaging platforms .This malware is known to infect computer systems through malicious emails that trick unsuspecting users into opening it . Once installed,FormBook can steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details and browsing data without the victims knowledge .FormBook is primarily focused on 
accessing information aboutinfected computers, as well as saved 
credentials or forms from browsers, 
applications, cryptocurrency wallets, and 
instant messaging platforms .It first appeared for sale in early 2016, and more recently itwas updated and rebranded as XLoader in late 2020 . Itssimple, easy to use, has many capabilities, and is highlypopular in the market .FormBook has infected millions of computers worldwide .Its use is often seen in cybercrimes such as identity theft,blackmailing, and financial fraud. As such, both individualsand businesses must take proactive steps to safeguard theirsystems against this threat .2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report15MALWARE FAMILYSnake KeyloggerSnake Keylogger, a staple in the phishing threat landscape throughout 2021 and 2022,continues to pose a significant risk to individuals and organizations in 2023\. Snake Keylogger,a particularly dangerous threat written in.NET, is designed to secretly monitor and recordevery keystroke on a computer, including usernames and passwords, scan applications to stealsaved credentials and exfiltrate this data through a variety of protocols delivering it back to thehackers to use or sell on the dark web . What makes the Snake Keylogger so concerning is itsability to evade detection by antivirus software and remain undetected on a target system forlong periods of time .Snake Keylogger made its first appearance in November 2020 and can still be purchased todayfor anywhere from $25 to $500 . Although it is not as popular as other malware families such asFormBook or Agent Tesla, it does maintain a significant presence and its usage is increasing.Snake 
Keyloggeris designed to 
secretly monitor 
and record every 
keystroke on a 
computer .Google AMP 
A New, Evasive Phishing TacticA new phishing tactic utilizing Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) has hit the threat landscape and proven to be verysuccessful at reaching intended targets. Google AMP is anopen\-source HTML framework used to build websites that areoptimized for both browser and mobile use . The websites that we observed in these campaigns are hosted on Google .com orGoogle .co .uk, both of which are considered trusted domains to most users . This phishing campaign not only employs GoogleAMP URLs to evade security but also incorporates a multitude ofother TTPs known to be successful at bypassing emailsecurityinfrastructure.Cofense observed a 
1,092% increase in Google 
AMP emails bypassing 
SEGs in the last six 
months of 2023 compared 
to the first six months.

20232024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report16BEC 
Costing Businesses BillionsAlthough business email compromise (BEC) did not make it on our list of top trends to watch, its still a clear and present dangerfor organizations and worth mentioning . BEC remains one of the most devastating cybercrimes for the 8th consecutive year .With billions lost globally and victims in 90% of countries around the globe, weve seen scammers continue to exploit this type ofcrime with great success. While spam filters have transformed into malware detectors, they often fail to catch conversational\-based phishing attacks, leading to billions of dollars being stolen year after year .BEC is a subset of credential phishing but because of its popularity and successful track record, it is often talked about as acategory of its own . By gaining access to an organizations email account, scammers can perform man\-in\-the\-mailbox attacks .They create email forward rules to monitor all incoming and outgoing traffic. When they find an opportunity to redirect atransaction, they reply to the email thread with new information, often from a look\-alike domain or compromised infrastructure .By modifying invoices with new account details, scammers successfully reroute funds, making it difficult to reverse thetransactions .Two\-factor authentication (2FA) is a recommended defense against these attacks . However, scammers have found a way tobypass 2FA through an adversary\-in\-the\-middle technique, gaining access to users accounts by hijacking session cookies .Another technique still flying under the radar is payroll diversion scams. Targeting human resources departments, threat actorsmanipulate financial records to redirect employees direct deposits. These attacks often go unreported and unnoticed, allowingscammers to continue their fraudulent activities .Traditional defenses are no longer enough to protect against BEC attacks . Organizations must stay vigilant and implement robustsecurity measures to safeguard their finances and sensitive information.FBI data identifies $51 billion 
inexposed losses due to business 
email compromise.
