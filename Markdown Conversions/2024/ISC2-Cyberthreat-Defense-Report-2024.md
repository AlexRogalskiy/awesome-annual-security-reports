unique role in the IT security industryOther surveys do a great 
job of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breaches
and exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other bad 
actorsOur mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of
IT security professionalsA decade after its first edition, the CDR has become a staple 
among IT security leaders and practitioners by helping them 
gauge their internal practices and security investments 
according to those of their counterparts across multiple 
countries and industriesIf you want to know what your peers
in IT security are thinking and doing, this is the place to lookCyberEdge would like to thank our Silver, Gold, and Platinum 
research sponsors, whose continued support is essential to the 
success of this reportTop Five Insights for 2024Our CDR reports yield dozens of actionable insightsHere are
the top five takeaways from this years installment:1 Confidence is buildingSeveral long\-running trends 
have reversed in the last year or twoSurvey data contains 
multiple indications that security professionals are becoming 
more confident about their ability to reduce the impact of 
cyberattacksThe percentage of organizations compromised 
by cyberattacks fell substantially from the previous survey 
(page 7\), and our respondents expect the number to fall 
even more this year (page 9\)We also saw improvements in 
our Threat Concern Index (page 18\) and Security Concern 
Index (page 31\)The former measures the overall level of 
concern about cyberthreats, and the latter measures the 
concern for inhibitors to IT security team successSurvey DemographicsResponses received from 1,200 qualified IT securitydecision makers and practitionersAll from organizations with more than 500 employeesRepresenting 17 countries across North America, Europe, 
Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and AfricaRepresenting 19 industries23 AI is taking center stageArtificial intelligence technologies 
are being incorporated into a very wide range of security 
solutionsThey promise to increase the power of security 
professionals to detect and block attacks, respond to 
incidents, and find and remediate vulnerabilitiesSecurity 
teams are looking at AI as a force multiplier that will make 
them more productive and effective (page 21\)Survey 
respondents expect AI to be deployed in many ways to both 
enhance and defeat cybersecurity measuresA plurality 
thinks the positive and negative outcomes will be in balance
However, of the rest, significantly more believe the benefits 
to security teams will be greater than the benefits to threat 
actors, creating an overall Advantage to Security (page 25\) Ransomware trends are changing directionSeveral 
persistent trends related to ransomware have turned around
Compared to our last survey, significantly fewer respondents 
reported that their organization had been victimized by 
ransomwareThe percentage of affected organizations 
paying ransoms declined, and so did the number of 
organizations that paid ransoms and managed to recover 
their dataThe reasons for these changes are complex, but 
we think we have untangled some of the threads (page 27\)2024 Cyberthreat Defense Report3Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupIntroduction45 Funding for security groups is not a problemA record 
number of security groups expect their budget to increase 
this year, and the size of the average expected budget 
increase grew (page 35\) Cybersecurity experts are now sitting on boardsWe 
found that three out of five organizations have a member
of the board of directors with cybersecurity experience
This has tremendous implications for the ways that security 
leaders and top executives interact (page 51\)About This ReportBy revealing these details, we hope to help IT security decision 
makers and practitioners gain a better understanding of how 
their perceptions, concerns, priorities, and defenses stack up 
against those of their peers around the worldIT security teams 
can use the CDRs data, analyses, and findings to shape answers 
to many important questions, such as: Where do we have gaps in our cyberthreat defenses relativeto other organizations? Have we fallen behind in our defensive strategy to the pointthat our organization is now the low\-hanging fruit (i e , likely 
to be targeted more often due to its relative weaknesses)?The CDR is the most geographically comprehensive, vendor\-
agnostic study of IT security decision makers and practitioners
Rather than compiling cyberthreat statistics and assessing 
the damage caused by data breaches, the CDR surveys the 
perceptions of IT security professionals, gaining insights into 
how they see the world Are we on track with both our approach and progress in 
continuing to address traditional areas of concern while 
tackling the challenges of emerging threats? How does our level of spending on IT security compareto that of other organizations?Specifically, the CDR examines: The frequency of successful cyberattacks in the prior year
and optimism (or pessimism) about preventing further 
attacks in the coming year The perceived impact of cyberthreats and the challengesorganizations face in mitigating their risks The adequacy of organizations security postures and theirinternal security practices The organizational factors that present the most significantbarriers to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses Do other IT security practitioners think differently aboutcyberthreats and their defenses, and should we adjust our 
perspective and plans to account for these differences?Another important objective of the CDR is to provide developers 
of IT security technologies and services with information they 
can use to better align their solutions with the concerns and 
requirements of potential customersOur data can lead to better 
market traction and success for solution providers, along with 
better cyberthreat protection technologies for our resolute 
security professionalsThe findings of the CDR are divided into four sections: Current investments in security technologies and thoseSection 1: Current Security Postureplanned for the coming year The health of IT security budgets and the portion of theoverall IT budget they consumeOur journey into the world of cyberthreat defenses begins 
with respondents assessments of the effectiveness of their 
organizations investments and strategies relative to the2024 Cyberthreat Defense Report4Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupIntroductionprevailing threat landscapeThey report on the frequency of 
successful cyberattacks, judge their organizations security 
posture in specific IT domains and security functions, and 
provide details on the IT security skills shortageThe data will 
help readers begin to assess: Whether, to what extent, and how urgently changes areneeded in their own organization Specific countermeasures that should be added tosupplement existing defensesSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsIn this section, our exploration of cyberthreat defenses shifts 
from establishing baseline security postures to determining 
the types of cyberthreats and obstacles to security that most 
concern todays organizationsThe survey respondents weigh 
in on the most alarming cyberthreats, barriers to establishing 
effective defenses, and high\-profile issues such as ransomware 
and security for hybrid cloud environmentsThese appraisals will 
help readers think about how their own organization can best 
improve cyberthreat defenses going forwardSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsOrganizations can ill afford to stand still when it comes to 
maintaining effective cyberthreat defensesIT security teams 
must keep pace with changes occurring in business, technology, 
and threat landscapesThis section of the survey provides data 
on the direction of IT security budgets, and on current and 
planned investments in network security, endpoint security, 
application and data security, and security management and 
operationsReaders will be able to compare their organizations 
investment decisions against the broad sample and get a sense 
of what hot technologies their peers are deployingThis year we added a special three\-question section on positive 
and negative outcomes expected when security teams and 
threat actors deploy AISection 4: Practices and StrategiesMitigating todays cyberthreat risks takes more than investing 
in the right technologiesYou must ensure those technologies 
are deployed optimally, configured correctly, and monitored 
adequately to give your organization a fighting chance to avoid 
being a front\-page news storyIn the final section of the survey 
our respondents provide information on how they are deploying 
and using leading\-edge technologies and services such as 
security analytics and IT security delivered from the cloudWe 
also look at how IT security training and professional certification 
can help enterprises address the serious shortfall in skilled IT

by a successful cyberattack within the past 12 months?In the 2023 CDR report, we said that IT security teams may 
have reached a turning pointAfter successful attacks increased 
steadily year after year, the curve seemed to have flattened out, 
and even started to reversePerhaps there is room for optimism, 
we thoughtPerhaps we are not doomed to an endless cycle of 
bad newsWell, our latest data strongly confirms that positive change in 
directionThe precentage of organizations compromised at 
least once by a successful cyberattack in the previous 12 months 
edged down from 86 2% in the 2021 CDR, to 85 3% in 2022, toAt least one successful attack

falling 3 2% to 81 5% (see the blue bars in Figure 1\)While that 
is still high by historical standards, it shows that the tide has 
definitely turnedEven more striking, the percentage of organizations experiencing 
six or more successful attacks dropped a whopping 11 2%, from 
39 2% to 27 8% (see Figure 2 and the red bars in Figure 1\)We 
havent seen a figure that low since 2018Its too early to start celebrating, thoughOrganizations of all 
sizes are still exposed to thousands of low\-level attacks every
dayThe financial, regulatory, and reputational costs of data 
breaches continue to riseRansom payments have soared as 
well (see page 28\)But cybersecurity professionals can take 
satisfaction in the fact that theyre blocking more attacks than
in any year since 2020What is causing this turnaround? We suggest several factors: A significant number of work\-from\-home (WFH) employees

of successful attacks is not uniform across the globe or among 
industriesFor example, you might want to think twice before accepting a 
cybersecurity job in MexicoA full 97% of organizations reported 
at least one compromise last year, and about half (52%) suffered 
six or moreOther countries where at least 85% of organizations 
experienced a successful attack were South Africa (89 6%), 
Colombia (87 5%), Spain (87 5%), and Brazil (85 3%)At the other

successful attacks are very likelyTheir number dropped 
precipitously, from 32 9% to 21 2%These figures do raise an interesting questionIf 81 5% of 
organizations experienced at least one compromise last year 
(Figure 1\), is it reasonable that only 66 7% will undergo the
same fate this year (Figure 5\)? Optimism is a good thingAs the 
poet Alexander Pope wrote: Hope springs eternal in the human 
breast However, we think these forecasts involve a bit of
wishful thinkingWhen breaking down the predictions by country, it is interesting 
to note that those expecting the greatest number of successful 
attacks this year are all in Asia: China (84 0%), Singapore (81 6%), 
and Japan (79 2%) (see Figure 6\)The least pessimistic are France 
(58 9%), Italy (57 1%), and South Africa (46 0%)And maybe you do want to accept that job in Mexico, at least 
if you enjoy working with optimistsAlthough 97 0% of our 
respondents in Mexico reported being compromised last year,

ability to defend itself across 13 IT domainsOur security professionals were most comfortable about the 
security of SaaS applications, with a score of 4 11 (on a scale of
1 to 5, with 5 being the best possible security posture)This 
reflects a high level of confidence in SaaS vendors and their 
ability to protect cloud\-based softwareIts also a nod to the91 6% of organizations that have already deployed SaaS security 
posture management (SSPM) solutions or are in the process of 
doing so (see page 53\)Respondents are also relatively satisfied with defenses for servers 
(4 08\) and datastores such as file servers, databases, and storage 
area networks (4 07\)In fact, datastores is one of only three areas 
where confidence increased from last year (more on that in

SCADA devices remained the area with the lowest score for 
security posture (3 88\)Security professionals continue to be 
concerned about the potential for attacks on manufacturing
and operations technologies (OT), a lack of security solutions
for that realm, and the challenges of integrating OT security 
with traditional data securityThey may also be on edge because 
of the potential for attacks on industrial infrastructure as an 
outgrowth of national and regional conflicts (see page 59\)A significant change from past years is theincrease in concern about protecting applicationworkloads in Docker and Kubernetes containersThis trend likely reflects a combination ofthe growing use of containerization for keyapplications and increased targeting of theseworkloads by threat actors A significant change from past years is the increase in concern 
about protecting application workloads in Docker and 
Kubernetes containersThis area fell from sixth place last year to 
twelfth in this surveyIn fact, the score for containers decreased 
by14, from 4 06 to 3 92, the biggest drop for any IT domain
This trend likely reflects a combination of the growing use of 
containerization for key applications and increased targeting
of these workloads by threat actorsSpeaking of lower scores, this year confidence in security posture 
dropped in 10 of the 13 domainsThat doesnt mean that there 
have been more successful attacks on those targetsRather, it 
implies that, in the continuing parallel arms races in different 
areas of IT security, security professionals know they need to be 
increasingly vigilant if they want to stay ahead of the bad guysOn the other hand, there was one positive surpriseInternet of 
Things (IoT) devices have been one of the top three areas of 
concern for several yearsIn this survey, they fell back to fifth 
from the bottomTheir score actually improved slightly from 
last year, going from 3 95 to 3 97This reflects the introduction 
of new security solutions for IoT, as well as the ability of existing

And conversely, are they a good sign for hiring managers 
desperately trying to fill vacancies? We wouldnt advise anyone 
to get too excited, at least in the short term, because there is 
still a massive deficit in qualified staffAccording to the 2023ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study, in 2023 the gap between 
the number of cybersecurity professionals that organizations 
require to defend themselves and the number of such personnel 
available actually increased by 12 6% worldwide and 19 7% in 
North AmericaAre tech industry layoffs a bad sign for securityprofessionals? And conversely, are they a goodsign for hiring managers desperately trying to fillvacancies? We wouldnt advise anyone to get tooexcited, at least in the short term, because there isstill a massive deficit in qualified staff Now, in the medium and long term, AI may have a significant 
impact on the shortage by increasing the productivity of 
cybersecurity workers, and perhaps even making some job 
descriptions obsoleteWe discuss that hypothesis in The Road 
Ahead section of this report, on page 58Why did we say that the security skills shortage is consequential? 
You can see the evidence on page 30, which shows that a lack 
of skilled IT security personnel is currently the second\-biggest 
factor inhibiting organizations from adequately defending 
themselves, second only to low security awareness among 
employeesIt has been the \#1 or \#2 factor for eight years now2024 Cyberthreat Defense Report16Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and Concerns Concern for CyberthreatsOn a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your overall concern for each of the following

high of 3 88 in the 2022 CDR, to 3 82 in the 2023 edition, to 3 72 
this yearLast year we attributed the decrease in the Threat Concern Index 
to workers returning to offices with more security in place than in

number of successful attacks, the size of ransoms demanded, 
and the percentage of victimized organizations that elect to 
pay ransoms can gyrate based on multiple reinforcing and 
offsetting factorsThese include the changing capabilities and 
motivations of ransomware gangs; the nature of attacks (now

of organizations to block, contain, or recover from attacks; 
pressures from outside parties such as law enforcement agencies

we had been tracking suddenly changed directionTo start 
with, after increasing steadily for five years, the percentage of 
organizations victimized by ransomware abruptly fell from
72 7% to 64 1% (see Figure 26\)We believe this reversal was caused by several factors: Organizations have invested in monitoring and security
tools to quickly detect and contain ransomware attacks 
before they do serious damage (in part because these 
capabilities are required to obtain cyber insurance policies) With more workers returning to the office post\-COVID 19,the attack surface has shrunk somewhat Ransomware gangs are targeting fewer, larger enterprisesand spending less time on small and medium\-sized 
organizationsWhy would a ransomware gang attack fewer targets? The 
members might decide to go after large enterprises that
could be induced to pay million\-dollar or multi\-million\-dollar 
ransomsBut to extract large payments from sophisticated 
organizations, the gang would need to research each victim, 
develop techniques to overcome advanced defenses, exfiltrate 
data as well as encrypt files, carry out prolonged negotiations, 
etcThis approach might result in a high return on investment 
from attacking targets with deep pockets but would lose
money if applied to smaller victims2024 Cyberthreat Defense Report27Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsThere is indeed evidence for this dynamicAccording to ransomware

hiring are bigger obstacles than any single technical challengeAlthough the exact order of the other factors has varied in 
recent years, the general picture has remained the sameOur 
respondents are particularly concerned about Too much data 
to analyze (3 46\), Poor integrationinteroperability between 
security solutions (3 45\), and Poorinsufficient automation of 
threat detection and response processes (3 43\)We can also learn a lot from the factors near the bottom of

ability to adequately defend themselves against cyberthreats 
(page 30\)Well, when we talk about problems, we like to suggest solutions
So this year we added a question to our survey about factors 
that would improve job satistfaction among IT security staff, 
potentially improving recruiting and retention (see Figure 34\)The item selected most often was cybersecurity training and 
certification, which was cited by 51 9% of the respondents
Cybersecurity personnel value ongoing training because it 
enables them to keep up with new security technologies and 
conceptsso that they can do their jobs better (and be rewarded 
for better performance)Not surprisingly, increased compensation was also a high 
priority, at number two (43 4%)2024 Cyberthreat Defense Report32Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsBut budget\-conscious security leaders take note: there are ways

of the world and large layoffs in some industries would cause IT 
security budget growth to slow or reverse in at least a few sectors 
in the coming yearBut on the contrary, survey respondents 
pretty much across the board are expecting healthy, even record 
IT security budget growthThe percentage of IT security groups predicting an increase in 
their budget in the year ahead has gone up every year since we 
started conducting our survey except for one (2021, because of 
COVID)This year that figure reached a new height: 88 7% (see

and an area where they absolutely must keep getting betterIn addition, the average (mean) increase in IT security budgets 
reached a record this year: 5 7%That compares favorably with

or careless users, or insecure code, or something elseBut strong 
network security solutions: Block a large percentage of scans and attacks, includingmost of the less\-sophisticated ones Collect data about attack\-related events that is essentialfor incident response and remediation Frustrate some threat actors and cause them to turn theirattention to easier targetsSo, if you are a security professional, it is helpful to know the 
network security technologies your peers are using today and 
the ones they plan to deploy in the near futureAt first glance, the most striking finding in Table 1 is the sharp 
drop by Advanced threat prevention (sandboxing, MLAI) from 
first place last year to seventh place this year in the currently 
in use columnThe percentage of organizations with these 
products installed is still substantial 52 0% but its down from 
56 8% in the last surveyHowever, we are pretty sure that security 
groups are not disappointed with this class of technology

control of endpoints and the applications that run on themWhile 
once defenders were mostly concerned with detecting malware 
files, now they also must worry about fileless malware and other 
threats that inject malicious code into registries and legitimate 
applications, use scripts and native utilities to launch attacks, and 
gain administrator privileges to disable security featuresAmong endpoint security solutions currently in use, basic 
anti\-virusanti\-malware products remain by far the most common 
(see Table 2\)They examine files to see if they match the signature 
of known malware, and they are employed in more than 
two\-thirds of the organizations in our surveyOf course, were 
pretty sure 100% of organizations scan for malware on endpoints, 
but increasingly those capabilities are included as one componentof EDR and EPP solutionsIn fact, the percentage of organizations 
running standalone basic anti\-malware packages has declined 
from 74 2% two years ago, to 72 6% last year, to 70 3% in the 
current surveyThe second most frequently installed endpoint security 
technology is endpoint data loss (or leak) protection (DLP)
Products in this field examine outgoing emails and documents 
to determine if they contain sensitive information such as 
financial account numbers, Social Security numbers, and other
PII and intellectual propertyThey then apply policies to take 
actions like blocking the export of the information or encrypting

for your organization? (Select up to three )We returned to a question about DevSecOps practices last 
asked in the 2021 CDRDevSecOps (a term that combines 
development, security, and operations) refers to integrating 
security design, security features, and security testing into Agile 
application development and deployment processesExamples 
include introducing security requirements in the design phase 
of applications; adding security features to the code during the 
main development process instead of trying to retrofit them into 
nearly finished applications; and ensuring that new applications, 
updates, and patches are rigorously tested for security 
defectsThese practices both improve security and speed up 
development and deployment cyclesAt least, that is the theoryWhat have been the most important 
benefits in practice? And have those changed over the last three 
years? Were glad you askedThere hasnt been much change at the top of the listThe 
two benefits cited most often, Increased speed of deploying 
application updates and Increased speed of deploying new 
applications are the same in the 2024 CDR as they were three 
years ago (see Figure 41\)The frequency with which they 
were selected changed only slightly, from 47 2% to 45 8% for 
accelerating updates, and from 45 8% to 45 6% for speeding
up new applicationsIts not surprising that these are popular benefits because, 
lets be frank, most application development teams are more 
motivated by quickly delivering new functional features than
by addressing security requirementsHowever, we see evidence of one noteworthy change in 
attitudes between the 2021 and 2024 surveys: respondents

practices lead to significant improvements in security that 
benefit organizations roughly as much as accelerating the 
delivery of updates and new applicationsThe final two benefits on our list, Improved relations between

advertising the fact that their solutions employ threat intelligence 
for tasks like making better context\-based authentication 
decisions and automatically prioritizing alertsBut what about 
enterprise IT security groups? We wanted to know how they are 
leveraging external threat intelligence (by external, we mean 
sourced outside of the organizations own infrastructure)The most common use of threat intelligence is To improve 
our ability to detect indicators of attack (IoAs) and indicators of 
compromise (IoCs), cited by 55 4% of respondents (see Figure 48\)
This result reflects the fact that operational and technical threat 
intelligence sources, such as databases of vulnerabilities, malware 
signatures, and indicators of attacks, are critical raw materials 
for many enterprise security products (such as firewalls, IDSIPS 
systems, anti\-malware products, and security analytics tools)2024 Cyberthreat Defense Report49Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and StrategiesNumber two on the list is To prioritize vulnerabilities and 
exposures to reduce our attack surface (49 5%)Threat 
intelligence informs security teams about newly discovered 
weaknesses they need to look for in their infrastructure
And because not all threats are equally serious or affect 
everyone, intelligence helps prioritize the ones to focus
on for detection and remediationThe third major use of threat intelligence is To uncover threat 
actors impersonating our websites and social media accounts 
(46 5%)This relates to brand protection or digital brand 
protection Brand protection involves detecting and taking 
down websites, social media accounts, and mobile apps 
resembling an organizations real digital assetsThese fake
assets are created by cybercriminals to defraud customers,
steal account numbers and access credentials, or sell counterfeit 
goodsThreats to the brand also involve social media posts and 
accounts created by hackers who impersonate the organizations 
employees to spread disinformationIt takes specialized skills 
and tools to find these websites and social media accounts, so 
most enterprises that are worried about them rely on external 
threat intelligence suppliersOther important use cases are obtaining intelligence about 
vulnerabilities and compromises at vendors and other supply 
chain partners (valuable information for third\-party risk 
management, or TPRM), and understanding threat actor groups 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) (critical intelligence 
for incident response and threat hunting)Discovering data breaches and stolen credentials on the dark 
web is not as common as the other use cases in this listHowever, 
we think more organizations will make use of that kind of threat 
intelligence in the futureOur data also shows that external threat intelligence is clearly
a must\-haveAlmost all organizations in our survey (97 3%, to
be precise) are leveraging it for one or more of these use cases

You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. 
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. 
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. Lyrics from Time by Pink FloydWe now have 10 years of Cyberthreat Defense Reports behind us
CyberEdge published the first one in the spring of 2014Every year 
since then we have introduced some new questions and retired 
others, but we kept a core set of topics that have carried throughsince 2014We thought it would be interesting to see how the 
answers to three of those questions have changed over the decade, 
and what those changes tell us about the state of cyber defenseHow many times do you estimate that your organizations global network has been compromised 
by a successful cyberattack within the past 12 months?This has been one of the cornerstone questions of the CDR since 
the beginningThe chart at right (also presented as Figure 1 on

or more attacks, and how many have been victimized by six or 
moreThere was a strong upward trend from 2014 through 2021, 
indicating that threat actors were pulling ahead in their arms 
race with defenders during that periodThen, in the 2022 CDR 
the trend lines flattened, and have decreased over the last two

There is no doubt that AI technologies will transform existing 
cyber battlegrounds between threat actors and security teams
Our survey includes input from security professionals about likely 
uses and abuses of AI (see pages 21\-26\)However, it is very likely 
AI will also have effects that few people, if any, can anticipateWe 
are paying very close attention to these developments, and so 
should everyone concerned with cybersecurityAI and Cybersecurity JobsAll of us should be asking ourselves, Could AI do my job?Most security professionals should not be overly concerned,
for two reasons: Many cybersecurity jobs require knowledge, judgment,
and experience that cannot be replicated by AI, at least
not yet There is still a significant shortage of experienced cybersecuritypeople (see pages 15 and 30\), so even in areas where AI 
boosts productivity, the immediate effect will be to bring 
supply and demand into balance, rather than to cause layoffsHowever, some cybersecurity jobs involve tasks that AI can perform 
very effectivelyExamples are collecting and classifying data, looking 
for vulnerabilities in configurations and code, and carrying out 
incident response playbooks and remediation processesThere is little doubt that security groups will look to leverage AI 
in these areasBut when that happens, we believe they should 
make a strong effort to retrain affected security professionals so 
they can fill vacancies in roles that AI cant take overRetraining 
will be cost\-effective (not to mention good for morale) compared 
to laying off people in one area while running expensive 
searches to hire outsidersEnough about probabilities and contingenciesLets talk about 
some inevitabilitiesA bunch of new regulations and industry 
standards (or major revisions) have come into force recently or 
will do so soonAmong them:U SSecurities and Exchange Commission rules requiring 
public companies to make additional disclosures about the 
nature, scope, and timing of material cybersecurity incidents, as 
well as to report annually on their cybersecurity risk management, 
strategy, and governanceThe SEC also adopted rules requiring 
foreign private issuers to make comparable disclosuresThe new 
rules go into effect at different times in 2024The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI 
DSS) v4 0 includes a load of new requirements for ecommerce 
companies, financial institutions, and other firms that handle 
payment card dataThe new rules relate to secure authentication, 
identity and access management, encryption, web application 
protection, risk management, compliance testing and reporting, 
and other areasSome of the new requirements become active 
on March 31, 2024, and others on March 31, 2025The European Union Network and Information Security 2 
(NIS2\) Directive expands the scope of EU cybersecurity rules 
to cover more companies, requires more incident reporting, 
and adds requirements for companies to address security risks 
related to supply chains and supplier relationships, among 
other changesIn addition, top executives will have to take 
responsibility for their organizations cybersecurity maturity
EU member states will have until October 17 to pass national 
legislation to enforce the provisionsThe EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) covers

happensBut today there is a risk that an active military conflict, 
or a behind\-the\-scenes struggle between nations, or the 
activities of rebels or terrorists supported by a regional power, 
will spill over to active fighting in cyberspaceThe nature and dimensions of such cyberwars are hard to 
predictBut if they occur, they are likely to involve a combination 
of disruption and disinformationAlso, the blast radius could
be much wider than most people realizeThere are quite a few potential targets:In the opposing country Political leaders Military organizations Companies in the defense industrial base (DIB) Transportation and infrastructure firms Media and communications outlets Financial institutionsIn other countries Political leaders who back the opposing country Military organizations that funnel weapons and ammunitionto the opposing country Transportation and infrastructure firms that carry suppliesto the opposing country Ecommerce companies, retailers, fast food and packagedfood companies, energy producers, telecom and technology 
firms, pharmaceutical companies, automakers, professional 
services firms, arts and entertainment organizations, etc , 
which are perceived as supporting the opposing country, its 
military, or its ideologyIn short, nearly every large organization, everywhere, even with
no obvious link to politics or defense work, could become a targetWhat are the implications? Organizations of all types should 
look carefully at the possibility that they might be targeted by 
participants in a hot, cold, or proxy warThey should consider 
what regions, what types of threats (such as DDoS attacks, 
attempts to steal intellectual property, attacks on operations, 
or misinformation and propaganda spread through counterfeit 
or compromised websites and social media accounts), and 
what monetary and reputational costs could be involvedSome 
organizations may only need to broaden the scope of existing 
risk management or geopolitical intelligence activities, but 
others might want to create a new working group or steering 
committee to assess the contingenciesAgain, we hope this exercise wont be needed, but we fear that
