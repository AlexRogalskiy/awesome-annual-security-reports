The Effect of Ransomware and
Unauthorized Access on Key IndustriesTo gain context into potential risks, organizations need to be aware of how the data breach landscape specifically affectstheir industry. How are threat actors gaining access into systems? Understanding the answer to this question is critical toforming safeguards and response plans.ManufacturingHealthcareGovernmentFinancialRetailTechnologyNumber of breaches754735582530291134Percentage of overall breaches

the Top Two Causes of Data Breaches in 2023\.Together, they are responsible for more than half of all incidents experienced by major sectors. However, for themanufacturing and technology industries, ransomware and unauthorized access accounted for more than 85% of allpublicly disclosed breach incidents. This data further illustrates the need for robust threat intelligence and vulnerabilitymanagement programs that can help reduce risk, prevent losses, and maintain day\-to\-day operations.flashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report7VulnerabilitiesThe data in this section comprises Flashpoints vulnerability intelligence, covering all attack surfacesincludingvendors, endpoints, cloud, Internet of things (IoT), operational technology, open source software (OSS), and third\-partylibraries and dependencies. Flashpoints vulnerability enrichment provides full context into metadata such as EPSS,exploit intelligence, social risk, and ransomware likelihood. Data is current to the date of publishing.From a threat actors perspective, unpatched vulnerabilities are opportunities to gain access into an organization. Byexploiting them, vulnerabilities allow malicious actors to spread through compromised networksallowing them toperform a wide variety of actions that may ultimately result in data loss or exposure. However, due to the increasingdisclosure of vulnerabilities from an expanded digital ecosystem, organizations may be unaware of vulnerabilities withintheir networks. One major blind spot occurs when enterprises strictly rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure(CVE) database, which is missing over 100,000 vulnerabilitiesnearly a third of known vulnerability risk.Flashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows thatdisclosed vulnerabilities have displayed aconsistent upward trend, with 2023 marking asignificant peak at 33,137 disclosures. Thisprogressive increase underscores theescalating challenge for cybersecurity defenses,as it is unfeasible for any organization, regardlessof maturity, to triage and remediate all of theseissues in a timely manner.Vulnerability Disclosures Reported by Year,2014\-23Number of vulnerabilitiesNumber of public exploits40,00030,00020,00010,000Vulnerability Disclosuresepor ed by Month, 2023\-24RtNumber of vulnerabilitiesNumber of public exploits4,0003,0002,0001,000JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN FEB2014201520162017201820192020202120222023The efficient identification, prioritization, andremediation of vulnerabilities are crucial inpreventing or mitigating the impact ofbreaches and cyber attacks.

This is nocoincidence as Microsofts Patch Tuesday has always played a major role in every years rising totals. As more vendorsadopt Microsofts monthly disclosure schedule, organizations will need a timely and actionable source of vulnerabilityintelligence to help reduce the need for lengthy manual research.Severitys effect on prioritizationFlashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that nearly 52% of all vulnerabilities disclosed in 2023 are scored high tocritical (7\.0 to 10\.0\) in severity, according to CVSSv3\. For most organizations, vulnerabilities scored between 7\.0 to 10\.0are considered to be a major risk, but if more than half of the years total meet this criteria, which ones should beprioritized? Remediation is a timely process, and if vulnerability management teams are expected to triage all of theseissues, it is highly possible that many of these issues will go unpatched.Breakdown of Vulnerabilities Disclosed
in 2023, CVSSv2 vs CVSSv3Organizations should also be aware that the National Vulner\-ability Database (NVD) no longer provides base scores forCVSSv2, and has instead opted to score using CVSSv3\. This isCVSSv2CVSSv3significant for three reasons.20,00015,00010,0005,000flashpoint.ioMany organizations still currently choose to rely on CVSSv2for prioritization.Due to differences in scoring methodologies, a vulnerabilityscored in CVSSv2 can vary greatly from CVSSv3, which canhave a major impact on prioritization.CVSSv4 was released in November 2023\.LowMediumHighCritical2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report9Flashpoint has found that categorizing high severity vulnerabilities based on the following criteria can have massive benefits for vulnerability management teams:Remotely exploitableKnown public exploitKnown solution detailsBreakdown of Actionable, High Severity Vulnerabilities, by

allow vulnerability management teams to 
cut their critical workloads by nearly 85%.By shifting immediate attention to issues that are remotely exploitable that have public exploits, with known solutioninformation, organizations can maximize their resources. Once those issues are fully triaged and taken care of, they canthen focus on less severe issues.flashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report10Beyond CVE: Uncovering the Hidden
Vulnerability LandscapeOrganizations strictly relying on CVE are likely unaware of nearly a third of known vulnerability risk. Flashpoint hasdocumented over 100,000 vulnerabilities that CVE has failed to report, many of which affect major vendors such asGoogle and Microsoft. Flashpoints non\-CVE coverage has also identified a significant number of issues affectingnumerous third\-party librariesin addition to zero\-day and in\-the\-wild exploits that are being used by threat actors.SAP AGGoogleZoho CorpMaria DB FoundationFFmpeg Project100,000IBM CorporationThe Apache

The group hasgained notoriety for its sophisticated and ruthlessstrain of ransomware. Recent analysis of a possibleLockBit 4\.0 variant noted functionality that includesrandomizing the victims file naming to complicaterestoration efforts, a self\-delete mechanism thatoverwrites LockBits own file contents with null bytes,and the ability to delete victims shadow copies andbackups to inhibit recovery. Coupled with their harshnegotiation practices, including the use of a tripleextortion method, victims of LockBit are often left tograpple with difficult decisions.LockbitBlackCatCl0pBlack BastaPlay8BaseCactusAkiraBianLianMedusaNoEscapeRoyalRhysidaRansomedSnatch4593523233232512492442431431271227964611,049flashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report12On February 20, 2024, US authorities, in collaboration with the UKs National Crime Agency and additionalinternational allies, announced the disruption of the LockBit ransomware group as part of a concerted initiative knownas Operation Cronos.Despite the success of Operation Cronos, the LockBit ransomware collective has persisted.

Nevertheless, as of this publishing, LockBit remains the most prolific ransomware group in 2024,
documenting 154 public victim announcements on their leak site within the first two months alonealmost 
triple the number of the second most active groups (8Base, BlackCat). Theres a possibility that the group 
could recover. However, even if they dont, numerous other cybercriminal factions are poised to take their 
place, indicating that the fight against cybercrime is expected to persist indefinitely.So far in 2024, the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks on organizations have increased, with 637 
public ransomware attacks in the first two months, up from 518 in the same period of 2023\. To mitigate this 
rising threat, its crucial for organizations to develop and implement robust prevention and response
strategies proactively. Delaying these discussions until after an attack occurs significantly hampers the
ability to reduce its impact.The construction and engineering sector 
emerged as the most targeted industry by 
ransomware in 2023, with 416 public
incidents. The professional services, internet 
software and services, and healthcare sectors 
were also heavily targeted in 2023,
highlighting the cross\-industry impact of
ransomware and the critical need for
sector\-specific defense strategies. In the first 
two months of 2024, the construction and
engineering sector remained the most
targeted with 57 public attacks so far. The 
manufacturing and healthcare sectors follow 
behind, each with 49 public attacks in the first 
two months of 2024\. These critical
infrastructure sectors share several
commonalities that make them lucrative for 
ransomware groups:Top Ten Industries Targeted by Ransomware in 2023Food Products

of operation that make it expensive to halt during ransom negotiations (for sectors like manufacturing
and construction and engineering), organizations in these sectors may have a higher willingness to pay
the ransom.3\. These organizations often generate higher amounts of revenue, which means ransomers can yield ahigher profit per victim compared to other industries.4\. They rely on operational technology that could contain vulnerabilities, providing a window for threatactors to gain access to victims systems.flashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report14Geographically, theUnited Statesbore the brunt ofransomware attacks, with2,386 incidents , reflectingits status as a major target due to its economicsignificance and digital infrastructure.Emerging Extortion TacticsAs ransomware groups become more sophisticated, threat actors are becoming increasingly hostile andbrazen as well. They are adopting new tactics to add external pressures. This includes doxxing executives,threatening to release embarrassing or sensitive information, or notifying the victims stakeholders thatthe company has been breached and is not willing to pay to protect compromised dataall to increase thelikelihood of payment. The extortion economy represents a growing risk to organizations that parallelsmany ransomware threats.To add further complexity, the lines between overt malicious actors and self\-proclaimed ethical hackersare increasingly blurred. Consequently, organizations must actively engage in these environments topreemptively counter threats and adapt strategies from ransomware response playbooks to address theselesser\-known extortion techniques.1\.2\.3\.4\.5\.6\.7\.Data Encryption: The most well\-known tactic of using malware to lock or encode a victims data,demanding payment for its decryption and release.Data Extortion: Threats have evolved from just ransom demands to broader threats of publicdata exposure.Unethical Vulnerability Disclosures: While many ethical hackers aim to responsibly disclosevulnerabilities, some blur the lines by tying their discoveries to monetary demands.Underground Economies Influence: Beyond merely trading stolen data, Dark Web marketplacesincrease the value of this data, treating it as a secondary market commodity to gain access tovictims systems.Access Brokers: The sale of unauthorized system access is on the rise, often serving as the precursorto multifaceted cyber attacks.Distributed Denial\-of\-Service (DDoS) Attacks: Attackers overwhelm a targets online services, causingthem to be unavailable. They then demand a ransom to stop the attack.Physical Threats Related to Cyber Activities: Extortionists sometimes combine cyber threats withphysical threats, suggesting harm might come to a victim or their loved ones unless demands related tocyber activities are met.flashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report15And How to Fight Back1\.2\.3\.4\.5\.6\.7\.Implement Robust Encryption and Backup Procedures: To counter data encryption tactics,organizations should ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted and regularly backed up to secure,off\-site locations. This minimizes the impact of ransomware attacks by allowing organizations to restoreencrypted data without paying a ransom.Advanced Threat Detection and Response: Employ advanced threat detection systems that utilizemachine learning and AI to identify unusual data access or transfer patterns, indicative of data extortionattempts. Establish a swift incident response plan to contain and mitigate threats before they escalate.Vulnerability Management Program: Develop a comprehensive vulnerability management programthat includes regular security assessments, penetration testing, and the prompt patching of softwarevulnerabilities. This reduces the risk of unethical vulnerability disclosures and ensures that potentialsecurity gaps are addressed before they can be exploited.Monitor and Analyze Dark Web Activities: Engage in continuous monitoring of Dark Web forumsand marketplaces to understand the latest trends in underground economies. Utilize this intelligenceto strengthen your security posture against emerging threats and to be aware of any mention of yourorganizations data on these platforms.Zero Trust Architecture: Adopt a zero\-trust security model that verifies every user and device tryingto access your network, regardless of their location. This approach minimizes the risk posed by accessbrokers by ensuring that access is strictly controlled and monitored.Protect Against DDoS Attacks. Implement DDoS protection solutions that can detect and mitigatelarge\-scale DDoS attacks. These services can help maintain the availability of online services during anattack, reducing the attackers leverage for ransom demands.Employee Education and Physical Security Measures: Educate employees about the risks of cyberthreats and the importance of physical security. This includes training on recognizing phishing attempts,securing personal and company devices, and reporting any suspicious activities. Enhance physicalsecurity measures to protect against threats that merge cyber and physical elements.flashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report16CommentaryBy Andrew Borene
Executive Director of Global SecurityBeyond Bytes and Bullets:
Shaping the Future of Allied Threat IntelligenceStrategies for integrating OSINT capabilities with cyber, physical, and geopoliticalintelligence to proactively fight global security threats.The need for a holistic, integrated approach to intelligence and security has never been more acute. The
challenges ahead are not only defending against attacks and increasing resilience; they lie in understanding 
and shaping the future of intelligence in a world where the digital and physical realms are inexorably linked.The importance of high\-fidelity, high\-reliability data in this context cannot be overstated, as it forms the very 
backbone of an intelligence enterprise that enables various decision makers to distill actionable insights from 
vast streams of information. Governments must make informed decisions to safeguard national interests and 
those of their allies. Private enterprises and corporate boards need insights to protect themselves from a 
growing field of e\-crime actors and state\-backed threats. Universities and research institutions must protect 
intellectual property. Global media entities need means to help validate trusted information and to debunk 
false narratives that may be amplified with deepakes and generative AI.Navigating this new era demands not just vigilance but innovation, as we chart a course through the
intertwined fog of digital and physical conflicts to safeguard our collective future.Converging Threats Across Conflicts
and Competitive DomainsOngoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel\-Hamas War in 
Gaza, expanding proxy violence in the Middle East, rising tensions in 
the Taiwan Strait, and new forms of large scale data theft and
extortion all underscore a near\-term future fraught with increasingly 
complex geopolitical and cyber challenges. This emerging landscape 
demands a profound reevaluation of how nations, non\-state actors, 
and intelligence communities navigate the intelligence needed
for warfare, peacekeeping, and protecting prosperity in our
interconnected world.This emerging landscape 
demands a profound
reevaluation of how 
nations, non\-state actors, 
and intelligence 
communities navigate the 
intelligence needed for 
warfare, peacekeeping, 
and protecting 
prosperity in our 
interconnected world.Through lenses of what is generally termed Great Power Competition 
by allies, and Hybrid Warfare or Unrestricted Warfare by adversaries, our understanding of global security is 
in a pivotal phase of transformation. This digital transformation and the entanglement of commercial,
government, and nonstate actors across an observed fragmentation of the cyber domain calls security
professionals toward a unified intelligence framework to seamlessly integrate cyber and physical threatintelligence in real time and at scale.flashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report17 
Developing Professionally\-Sourced Intelligence
(Pro\-SINT) within OSINTAs we confront these multifaceted threats, we may need to embrace a subtle distinction between
Open\-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and a subset that I call Professionally\-Sourced Intelligence (Pro\-SINT). 
What I unofficially refer to as Pro\-SINT is distinct from a growing set of crowdsourced, hobbyist, and other 
unfiltered OSINT efforts using publicly\-available information. Pro\-SINT leverages more proprietary and
commercially\-available information and is marked by professional standards, oversight, privacy compliance, 
ability to collaborate with law enforcement entities, and most importantly a deep commitment to a set of 
international ethics that aligns with those of allied governments, regulated industries, and a scientific
standard for verification and auditability.The type of Professional OSINTer Ive described, may reside in a government, a company, an NGO, or a
university, but they all share a focus on deep\-web data, Dark Web exploration, cyber\-physical convergence, 
and sophisticated analysis, enriching traditional human observational intelligence methods and analytical 
judgment with the technologies required to provide nuanced insights at scale among the complex interplay 
of cyber and physical threats in real time.Professional OSINT is not only about enhancing defensive measures or reducing mean times to resolution of 
vulnerabilities, but about preemptively understanding and countering the strategic moves of adversaries,
frequently seen in the chatter of encrypted communications preceding abrupt attacks or indicating
persistent intrusion. Moreover, the integration of well\-trained and auditable artificial intelligence and
machine learning technologies into intelligence operations for commercially\-available information offers
unprecedented capabilities in detecting deepfakes and other sophisticated cyber threats, further enhancing 
our ability to anticipate and mitigate potential escalations in both cyber and kinetic domains, bolstering
security postures for individual organizations, governments, and alliances.A professional ethos is also essential to navigate the complexities introduced by decentralized platforms and 
Dark Web tools, which, while enabling resilience against censorship and protection from hostile surveillance 
in many parts of the world, also can pose challenges in distinguishing credible intelligence frommisinformation in open societies.Challenges in Decentralized Communications 
and the Dark WebA unique aspect of a hybrid digital evolution has been the role of decentralized communication platforms 
and the expanding use of Dark Web communications by both threat actors and friendly users with legitimate 
needs for protection and undetected attribution.These platforms have transcended their initial purposes to become digital command centers and
sanctuaries for many unfiltered narratives. Their observed impact in facilitating real\-time, unedited 
 information flows during the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza has been profound, underscoring the blurring
lines between cyber, information, and kinetic warfare and highlighting the strategic significance of data in 
modern warfare.flashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report18 
Cross\-platform, encrypted messaging, and Dark Web service platforms have also proved useful sources for 
key insights into the strategic, operational, and tactical context of challenges including proxy violence in the
Middle East, tensions in the Taiwan Strait, hostile espionage activities against allies, in addition to the evolving 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber
criminals for extortion or fraud.Cyber Escalation in Modern Conict:

sophistication, evolving from 
hashtags to defacements and 
distributed denial\-of\-service 
(DDoS) attacks.Strengthening collaboration among allies becomes crucial as we collectively counteract the threats posed by 
adversaries and protect shared economic interests and democratic values in cyberspace. However, achieving 
such unity in intelligence and security efforts presents its own set of challenges. Divergent political interests, 
varying levels of technological sophistication, and concerns over sovereignty and privacy can hinder the
formation of a cohesive global threat picture for allies across public sector and private sector pillars.
Recognizing these differences and ensuring an ability to appropriately tailor data collection and use for each 
individual client is paramount as we strive for a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to professionalsecurity intelligence.flashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report19 
Toward a Unified Approach to Global Security IntelligenceThe interwoven nature of ongoing wars, global conflicts, and the critical role of digital platforms in these
dynamics underscore the imperative for comprehensive and forward\-looking intelligence collaboration
strategies. These strategies must not only address the immediate challenges posed by the current
geopolitical and cyber threats but also anticipate the evolving nature of warfare, espionage, and transnational 
criminal enterprise.The insights gained by professional OSINTers are indispensable in this endeavor, enabling responses that are 
as dynamic and multifaceted as the threats faced by our clients.In navigating this complex landscape, a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to security becomes
paramount. By fostering unity among commercial enterprises, governmental agencies, and international
partners, we can develop robust, adaptable security strategies that transcend traditional paradigms. This 
unified approach, leveraging the latest technological advancements and prioritizing ethical, legal, and political 
frameworks, is our best defense against the insidious threats that seek to undermine our institutions,
economies, and democracies.Embracing the interconnected world as it is, not as we wish it to be, is a key first step. It requires
understanding the criticality of machine speed and scale in the digital domain, while always remembering 
that humans are more important than hardware. Developing high\-fidelity data sourcing and high\-trust
professional networks will help us protect the foundations of our global society alongside our allies and in 
defense of our collective security. Our shared prosperity demands it.Security and intelligence professionals all face a new hybrid era. The global threat landscape is transforming 
and scalingfortunately, so are we.flashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report20Case StudyLeveraging Threat Intelligence in Public Safety Missions:
Investigating Sales of Fentanyl PrecursorsIn the complex global security challenge posed by the trafficking of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, theimportance of open\-source intelligence (OSINT) in public safety missions cannot be overstated. FlashpointNational Security Solutions (FNSS) stands at the forefront of addressing these challenges by providingtailored intelligence that empowers government and public sector entities to conduct effectiveinvestigations.This case study explores how Flashpoints advanced OSINT capabilities have empowered government andpublic sector agencies to unravel the sophisticated networks behind the sales of fentanyl precursors(chemicals used to manufacture the synthetic opioid) on digital platforms. By dissecting the digital footprintof the fentanyl precursor trade, Flashpoint provides the critical tools and intelligence needed for public safetyand national security teams to anticipate, mitigate, and disrupt these illicit activities effectively.The ChallengeThe trafficking of synthetic opioids has reached alarming levels, with threat actors employing increasinglysophisticated methods to evade detection. In particular, the sale of fentanyl precursorsoften advertisedopenly yet obscured through scientific nomenclature and digital platformsposes significant hurdles for lawenforcement and public safety agencies. To effectively understand, counteract, and dismantle these illicitnetworks, adopting an innovative investigative strategyintegrating both proprietary technology andopen\-source intelligenceis crucial, as illustrated in the accompanying chart.Open

CAS numbersflashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report21The SolutionIn response to the growing threat, Flashpoint analysts embarked on an investigation targeting the sale offentanyl precursors, particularly those originating from Chinese chemical manufacturing companies. Utilizinga multi\-faceted approach, the team leveraged:The Flashpoint intelligence platform for insights into synthetic opioid trafficking trends on the Deep andDark Web (DDW) and social mediaOptical character recognition (OCR) to sift through digital images for hidden cluesOpen\-source intelligence for additional context on trafficked substancesAdvanced data mining techniques to sift through vast datasets, including social media chatter, marketadvertisements, and digital communicationsEchosec, a component of Flashpoints Physical Security Intelligence suite, to expand the investigationinto a broader array of social media platformsCorporate data sources to investigate the ownership and operational structures of companies involved inthe precursor tradeThe ResultsThe investigation unveiled a complex web of Chinese chemical companies involved in the manufacture anddistribution of fentanyl precursors. Despite Chinas regulatory efforts, these entities have found ways to caterto the US market, often using mislabeling tactics and intermediaries to skirt US laws. Flashpoints analysisrevealed:Indictments against several companies and individuals for their role in the fentanyl precursor tradeAdvertisement strategies employed by these companies on various digital platforms, including socialmedia and dedicated websitesThe use of advanced money\-laundering techniques and encrypted communication platforms like WeChatto facilitate operationsflashpoint.io2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report22Closing ThoughtsTaken together, the data and analysis in the Flashpoint 2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report depict alandscape of threats that continue to grow in volume and complexity, from ransomware attacks and databreaches to vulnerability exploitation and geopolitical conflict. Three themes rise above as takeaways tonavigate this challenging environment:Anticipate and adapt to the convergence of
cyber, physical, and geopolitical threats.
As attacks increasingly target where geopolitical and commercial interests intersectthen take hybrid formsorganizations must not get caught in their traditional silos offunctions and geographies. New levels of collaboration are required both within andoutside of organizations, from the sharing of data and analysis to defining the protocolsto act decisively on it.Raise the bar on the actionability of data. 
It is impractical for security teams to grow at the same rate as the attacks that wevereported on in this report. More data isnt the solution to staying a step ahead; its aboutthe quality, actionability, and tailoring of data to an organizations specific needs.Harness the power of technology and artificial intelligence (AI)
in service of human intelligence, not in place of it.
AI is already delivering powerful capabilities to help organizations distill overwhelmingamounts of information about potential threats.
