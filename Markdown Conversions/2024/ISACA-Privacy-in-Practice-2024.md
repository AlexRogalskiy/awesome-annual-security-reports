Privacy in Practice 2024 reports the results of the ISACA global State of Privacy Survey 
conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023\. This report focuses on privacy staffing, privacy 
operations, compliance, awareness training, privacy by design and breaches. While some 
survey findings are consistent with last years survey results, others indicate that privacy 
teams may need to manage with fewer resources in the next year.

Executive Summary
Privacy in Practice 2024 explores privacy staffing, 
operations, compliance efforts, awareness training, 
breaches and privacy by design based on the results of 
the fourth annual ISACA global State of Privacy Survey 
conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023\.
Respecting data subjects and protecting their privacy 
is a key component of digital trust. Additionally, failure 
to comply with privacy laws and regulations could 
result in significant fines and reputational harm. Privacy 
professionals who optimize their resources and build 
privacy into their products and services can gain a 
competitive advantage and protect their consumers. This 
survey report examines the state of organizational privacy.
Key Findings
This years survey results reveal important insights
for enterprises:
Demand for technical privacy roles is significantly 
more likely to increase in the next year than demand 
for legalcompliance roles.
Perceptions of funding and board prioritization of 
privacy are comparable to those reflected in last years 
survey results.
Expert\-level privacy professionals are the most difficult 
to hire, consistent with last years findings.
The most common obstacles to creating privacy 
programs are a lack of competent resources; a 
lack of clarity on the programs mandate, roles and 
responsibilities; a lack of executive or business 
support; and a lack of visibility and influence within
the enterprise.
The most common privacy failure is poor or 
nonexistent training.
This years respondents were significantly more likely 
than last years to believe their privacy budget would 
decrease in the next 12 months.
Respondents identified the chief privacy officer role as 
the most likely to be accountable for privacy operations.
Over one\-third of respondents had no plans to use 
artificial intelligence (AI) to perform privacy\-related 
tasks despite understaffing and lack of funding.
Based on the survey responses, enterprises that 
practice privacy by design are more likely to:
Have more interaction across all functional areas of 
the organization
Have an organizational privacy strategy that aligns 
with other organizational objectives
Be confident in their organizations ability to ensure 
the privacy of its sensitive data
Feel their privacy budget is appropriately funded
Separate privacy training from security training
Survey Methodology
In the fourth quarter of 2023, ISACA sent survey 
invitations to approximately 15,500 ISACA constituents 
who held the Certified Data Privacy Solutions Engineer 
(CDPSE) designation or had privacy in their job title. 
Invitations were also sent to those who held the ISACA 
CSX Cybersecurity Practitioner Certification (CSX\-P) 
or Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) 
designation. More than 1,300 people completed the survey.
Privacy professionals who optimize their 
resources and build privacy into their 
products and services can gain a competitive 
advantage and protect their consumers.

FIGURE 1: Respondent Demographics

PRIVACY IN PRACTICE 2024
 2024 ISACA. All Rights Reserved.
Some respondents held multiple additional ISACA 
certifications. Thirty\-nine percent of respondents were in 
management roles, 28 percent were in senior leadership 
roles, 20 percent were individual contributors, and the 
remaining 13 percent were in executive leadership 
positions. Figure 1 shows additional demographic 
information about survey respondents.
Staffing Trends
Privacy professionals largely fall into two groups: 
legalcompliance professionals and technical privacy 
professionals. Legalcompliance professionals have 
expertise in the law and the ability to understand 
regulatory obligations. Technical privacy professionals 
have the skills and experience to evaluate and apply 
technical controls that can help achieve privacy 
objectives. In some enterprises, professionals in these 
roles work side\-by\-side on the same team, while in other 
enterprises, these roles are distinct functions that report 
to different executive leaders.
Technical privacy roles appear to be more understaffed 
than legalcompliance roles. Fifty\-four percent of survey 
respondents said technical privacy roles were somewhat 
or significantly understaffed, while 44 percent of survey 
respondents said legalcompliance roles were somewhat 
or significantly understaffed. This is consistent with 
previous years findings, in which technical privacy 
roles were typically more understaffed than legal and 
compliance roles. In this years survey, the median 
privacy staff size was nine employees, compared to 10 
last year, so it is not surprising that this understaffing 
trend is unchanged from last years findings. 
Open Privacy Positions
Many respondents indicated that their enterprises 
had open privacy roles. Twenty\-five percent said their 
organizations had open legalcompliance privacy roles, 
and 31 percent reported open technical privacy positions. 
This is a slight decline from last year when 27 percent of 
respondents organizations had open legalcompliance 
positions and 34 percent had open technical privacy 
positions. This is consistent with anticipated budget cuts; 
if privacy budgets are expected to decrease, it makes 
sense that hiring will slow down.
Figures 2 and 3 show the time required to fill privacy 
roles with a qualified candidate for legalcompliance and 
technical privacy roles, respectively. These findings are 
comparable to last years.
Eighteen percent of respondents said the time required to 
fill legalcompliance roles had somewhat or significantly

increased, which is identical to last years findings. 
Nineteen percent of respondents said the time required 
to fill open technical privacy positions had increased. This 
represents a decline from last year when 23 percent of 
respondents said the time to fill open technical positions 
had somewhat or significantly increased.
Qualifications
A major impediment to filling open positions is that 
many applicants are not considered well qualified. Only 
21 percent of respondents indicated that more than half 
the applicants to legalcompliance roles and technical 
privacy roles in their enterprises were well qualified for 
position for which they are applying, compared to 24 
percent for legalcompliance applicants and 25 percent 
for technical privacy applicants last year. 
Figure 4 shows the top five skill deficiencies among 
privacy professionals as identified by survey respondents.
The top two deficiencies identified this year were the same 
as last year. However, the third\-largest skill deficiency 
identified this year was technical expertise. Forty\-nine 
percent of respondents identified technical expertise 
as a big skill gap, representing a 4 percent increase 
over last year. The fourth area of concern this year was 
understanding the laws and regulations applicable to an 
organization. Forty\-four percent of respondents named it 
as a significant concern2 percent lower than last year, 
when understanding laws and regulations was the third\-
biggest skill deficiency identified. 
These results may signal a shift in hiring managers 
expectations for privacy professionals. Possibly they 
understand that very few candidates with technical 
expertise will also have legal expertise, and they may

everything. It is also possible that the rapidly evolving 
technology landscape has made technical expertise a 
more valuable candidate trait.
Figure 5 shows the importance of a variety of factors 
in determining a job applicants qualifications and 
compares this years findings to last years. The figure 
shows the percentage of respondents who considered 
the factor in question to be very or somewhat 
important. Though survey respondents indicated 
that previous privacy experience was desirable in 
a candidate, the reality is that many practitioners 
pivoted to their careers in privacy. Forty\-four percent 
of respondents said that more than half of their 
enterprises privacy staff started their careers in a 
completely different field and transitioned to privacy 
roles. In fact, only 18 percent of respondents indicated 
that more than half of their enterprises privacy staff 
began their careers in privacy.
These findings are consistent with the findings shown in 
figure 6, which illustrate the strategies enterprises use to 
address the privacy skills gap.

Demand for Privacy
Professionals
Expert privacy professionals are the most challenging 
category to hire as evidenced by 76 percent of 
respondents, followed by practitioners (48 percent)
and entry levelfoundational privacy professionals
(14 percent).
The demand for privacy professionals across all 
expertise levels is expected to increase over the next 
year. Figures 7 and 8 show the anticipated demand for 
legalcompliance and technical privacy professionals 
over the next year, respectively. This years respondents 
did not believe the demand would increase as 
significantly as last years respondents did. Last year, 
62 percent of respondents said they anticipated the 
demand for legalcompliance roles would increase, and 
69 percent of respondents said the demand for technical 
privacy professionals would increase in the next year. 
The increasing demand coupled with staff retention 
challenges could exacerbate understaffing issues in
the future. Forty\-one percent of respondents said
they experienced difficulty in retaining qualified
privacy professionals.

Privacy Operations
To be successful, privacy programs require buy\-in from the 
entire enterprise. Privacy professionals need to collaborate 
with nearly every department in their organization. The 
tone set at the top influences the enterprises attitude 
and culture toward privacy. Enterprises with boards of 
directors that do not adequately prioritize privacy and that 
fail to provide it with the resources and funding it needs 
will likely experience challenges in accomplishing privacy 
objectives and meeting compliance requirements.
Collaboration
Privacy professionals must collaborate regularly with 
other enterprise functions. Figure 9 shows the functional 
areas privacy professionals must work with and the 
percentages of respondents who said they always or 
frequently collaborated with these departments. 
It is concerning that only 34 percent of respondents 
regularly worked closely with procurement; only 34 
percent worked regularly with productbusiness 
development; and a mere 23 percent worked regularly 
with sales, marketing and customer relations. Procuring 
technology that has strong privacy controls built in is 
crucial to protecting data subjects. The technology 
underlying an organizations offerings must protect 
privacy, and without being involved with the procurement 
process, it is nearly impossible for privacy professionals

to practice privacy by design. Product development 
may leverage deceptive privacy practices, but privacy 
professionals who work closely with them can guide 
them away from products that do not align with privacy 
objectives. Marketing teams often rely heavily on data to 
inform marketing efforts, and privacy professionals can 
also guide marketing teams away from deceptive privacy 
practices and excessive consumer tracking.
Accountability for Privacy
Depending on how an organization is structured and 
taking into account the competencies of the C\-suite, 
privacy professionals may report to different leaders. 
Figure 10 shows who is primarily accountable for privacy. 
These results are consistent with the 2023 survey findings. 
Enterprise size may affect who is ultimately accountable 
for privacy. Twenty\-seven percent of respondents who 
worked at enterprises with fewer than 250 employees 
said the chief executive officer (CEO) was accountable 
for privacy, but only 8 percent of respondents at 
organizations with more than 25,000 employees said 
the CEO was primarily responsible. Thirty\-two percent 
of respondents at enterprises with 25,000\+ employees 
said the chief privacy officer was primarily accountable 
for privacy at their organization, but only 10 percent 
of respondents at enterprises with fewer than 250 
employees said a CPO was primarily responsible. 
Compared to a chief privacy officer, a CEO is likely less 
aware of what privacy entails and why it is important, and 
privacy professionals who report to the CEO could face 
a bigger challenge in obtaining executive\-level buy\-in for 
privacy initiatives.
Privacy professionals should be aware of potential 
conflicts of interest depending on where the privacy 
function resides within an organization. Security may be 
at odds with privacy at times. For example, the security 
concept of nonrepudiation (that is, the assurance that 
a party cannot later deny originating data and provision 
of proof of the integrity and origin of the data that can 
be verified by a third party) could be at odds with an 
individuals right to communicate privatelyfor example, 
with an anonymous ethics hotline. Additionally, reporting 
to legal could represent a conflict of interest because 
privacy focuses on the rights of individuals while legal 
departments focus primarily on protecting the enterprise.

Boards of Directors and
Privacy
The board of directors can have a significant impact 
on an enterprises privacy program. Fifty\-seven percent 
of respondents said their boards adequately prioritized 
privacy. This is a slight increase compared with last 
year when 55 percent of respondents said their boards 
adequately prioritized privacy. Figure 11 shows board 
prioritization of privacy.
Boards may prioritize privacy programs in a few ways. 
A compliance\-driven approach considers privacy a 
regulatory requirement. An ethical approach prioritizes 
privacy regardless of applicable laws and regulations. 
Some enterprises may view privacy protection as a 
competitive advantage, and many enterprises will 
combine approaches to privacy prioritization. Figure 12 
shows how boards view privacy programs.
Last year, only 33 percent of respondents said their 
boards viewed privacy as being compliance\-driven, while 
this year that number rose to 44 percent. It is possible 
that recent enforcement actions and new privacy laws 
and regulations have made compliance a higher priority 
for enterprises. The compliance\-driven perception was 
slightly higher among Europe\-based respondents, with 49 
percent reporting their boards viewed privacy programs 
as compliance\-driven. This result is unsurprising, 
considering the far\-reaching impacts of the European 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Seventy\-four percent of respondents said their 
organizations privacy strategy was aligned with 
organizational objectives, 11 percent said it was not 
and 15 percent did not know. This represents a slight 
increase from last year, when 73 percent of respondents 
said their organizations privacy strategy was aligned with 
organizational objectives.

PRIVACY IN PRACTICE 2024

Funding
Board prioritization and the organizational perception 
of privacy is important as it could affect staff buy\-in for 
privacy initiatives and resources available for privacy 
teams. Figure 13 shows respondents perceptions of 
privacy funding at their enterprises.
This years survey finding that 43 percent of respondents 
considered their organizations privacy budgets 
underfunded is fairly consistent with last years, when 42 
percent held that view. However, respondents were much 
less optimistic about the future of privacy budgets this 
year compared to last year (see figure 14\).
It appears that privacy budgets have been declining 
significantly in recent years. Just two years ago, only 8 
percent of respondents believed their privacy budgets 
would decline in the next 12 months. It is surprising 
that in the midst of a rapidly evolving regulatory 
landscape, privacy professionals this year still

believed their budgets for the next year would shrink. 
This is especially concerning because 63 percent of 
respondents who believed their privacy budgets were 
already underfunded anticipated that funding would 
decrease in the next 12 months. This suggests that 
some teams that are already struggling with limited 
resources may find their problems exacerbated
next year. 
Perhaps allaying some fears about budget cuts, only 5 
percent of respondents expected a significant decrease 
compared to 46 percent who said their privacy budgets 
would somewhat decrease. Budget cuts may not be 
drastic, but privacy professionals should be prepared for 
some cuts. This aligns with global economic trends; global 
growth in 2024 is forecast to be lower than in 2023\.1
But privacy may be disproportionately affected by the 
economic downturn: Only 11 percent of respondents to 
ISACAs State of Cybersecurity 2023 survey anticipated 
a decrease in their cybersecurity budget.2 This 
could be because high\-profile breaches, such as the 
LastPass breach,3 and concerns about ransomware 
have motivated enterprises to not cut cybersecurity 
spending. More concerning is the possibility that 
enterprises believe cybersecurity and privacy are 
interchangeable and that cybersecurity professionals 
are tasked with privacy and vice versa.
Artificial Intelligence
Despite challenges associated with understaffing and 
underfunding, most respondents were not leveraging 
artificial intelligence (AI) for privacy work. Figure 15 
shows a breakdown of respondents use of AI in privacy\-
related tasks.
Only 8 percent of respondents were using AI for privacy\-
related tasks, compared with last year when 11 percent of 
respondents said they were using AI. In last years survey, 
20 percent of respondents said they planned to implement 
AI for privacy tasks in the next 12 months, but based on 
this years survey findings, that has not happened. 
This is surprising, as 41 percent of respondents to a 
recent ISACA survey indicated that their organizations 
employees were using generative AI.4 It is possible 
that privacy professionals are not using AI, but their 
colleagues across the organization areand without 
any privacy\-related considerations or oversight.

The reluctance to adopt AI might be a positive sign: Survey 
respondents might understand that AI is not a panacea 
for privacy challenges. Enterprises in organizations with 
lower revenues and smaller staff sizes were considerably 
less likely to use AI. Forty\-eight percent of respondents 
in enterprises with less than US$50 million in revenue 
said they had no plans to use AI for privacy\-related tasks, 
compared to just 24 percent of those in enterprises with 
more than US$1 billion in revenue. Forty\-nine percent of 
respondents in enterprises with fewer than 250 employees 
said they had no plans to use AI for privacy\-related tasks, 
compared to just 23 percent of those in organizations with 
more than 25,000 people. These findings suggest that 
small enterprises understand that leveraging AI requires 
governance and resources to effectively manage it, and 
employing AI for privacy\-related tasks might stretch an 
already overtaxed staff.
Privacy professionals largely seem to understand that 
AI could carry privacy\-related risk. For example, if an 
AI platform uses inputs to train future outputs, inputs 
of personal information could shape future outcomes, 
which might result in privacy violations. Forty\-five
percent of respondents who were not at all confident 
in their enterprises data privacy abilities said they had 
no plans to use AI for privacy\-related functions, and 
53 percent of respondents who were not so confident 
in their data privacy abilities said they had no plans 
to use AI for privacy tasks. This suggests that privacy 
professionals understand the risk associated with AI 
and that until their privacy program matures, the risk 
associated with using AI for privacy tasks outweighs
the benefits.
Compliance
To date, more than 160 privacy laws have been enacted 
internationally.5 Because of the numerous privacy laws and 
regulations in effect, privacy teams are often scrambling 
to keep up with their compliance\-related obligations. Using 
a framework or legal foundation to manage privacy can 
provide enterprises with clear objectives. Seventy\-eight 
percent of survey respondents said they used a framework 
or lawregulation to manage privacy in their organizations. 
Figure 16 shows the five frameworks and regulations 
most commonly used to manage privacy.
There are some regional differences as to which 
frameworks or regulations are used to manage privacy. 
For example, 78 percent of respondents in Europe used the 
GDPR, and 61 percent of respondents in North America 
used the NIST Privacy Framework to manage privacy.

Technical privacy professionals must work closely with 
legalcompliance teams to understand their regulatory 
obligations. Figure 17 shows how often technical privacy 
professionals reported meeting with legalcompliance 
professionals.
Privacy professionals who meet with legalcompliance 
teams only when new privacy laws and regulations 
go into effect should consider meeting on a regular 
schedule. The challenge with meeting only when new 
laws and regulations go into effect is that enforcement 
actions or data transfer\-related resources that are 
not new per sefor example, the EU\-US Data Privacy 
Frameworkcould significantly impact an enterprises 
day\-to\-day operations. Additionally, meeting regularly can 
allow technical privacy professionals to check in with 
legal practitioners to evaluate if the privacy controls in 
place do, in fact, meet the enterprises privacy obligations.
Many enterprises are aiming higher than achieving 
compliance; they are putting additional privacy controls 
in place that go beyond what is legally required. This 
might include applying controls to data not subject 
to privacy laws or regulationsfor example, adopting 
GDPR requirements for all data subjects regardless 
of their location. The top five most\-used additional 
controls reported by survey respondents are:
Identity and access management (74 percent)
Encryption (73 percent)
Data security (72 percent)
Data loss prevention (67 percent)
Incident response plan (63 percent)
Given the myriad privacy laws and regulations with which 
enterprises may need to comply, it is not surprising 
that some privacy professionals struggle to achieve 
compliance with new privacy laws and regulations and 
have concerns about their ability to ensure data privacy. 
Figure 18 shows respondents confidence in their ability 
to achieve compliance.

As a result of some privacy laws and regulations, data 
subjects may have the right to request that their data 
be accessed, deleted or moved. Thirty\-one percent of 
respondents said the number of data subject requests 
increased in the past year, while 31 percent said it 
stayed the same, 6 percent said it decreased and 33 
percent did not know. Although the percentage of 
respondents who did not know about data subject 
requests may seem high, many people working in 
technical privacy may not resolve data subject requests 
or work directly with customers; they may be working on 
the back end, ensuring that the necessary technology is 
in place to honor data subject requests.
Privacy by Design
Privacy by design refers to the integration of privacy into 
the entire engineering process. It involves thinking of 
privacy as part of basic functionality rather than treating 
it as an afterthought. It is worthwhile to regularly practice 
privacy by design as it could help with compliance 
efforts. In the event of a privacy breach, data subjects 
may experience less harm if the enterprise practices 
privacy by design. Sixty\-nine percent of respondents 
said their enterprises practiced privacy by design when 
building new applications and services, while 17 percent 
said their enterprises did not and 14 percent did not 
know. Figure 19 shows how frequently respondents 
practiced privacy by design.
Consistent with previous years survey results, those at 
enterprises that always practice privacy by design tend 
to have more resources. For example, the median staff 
size at enterprises that always practice privacy by design 
was 15 compared to 9 for total respondents. However, the 
median staff size among enterprises that always practice 
privacy by design was considerably lower compared with 
last year when the median staff size was 19\. 
Some other key trends among those who always practice 
privacy by design compared to the total respondents 
include:
More likely to say their technical privacy department 
was appropriately staffed (42 percent vs. 34
percent total)
More likely to believe their board of directors 
adequately prioritized privacy (77 percent vs. 57 
percent total)
Less likely for boards to view the privacy program
as purely compliance\-driven (35 percent vs. 44
percent total)

More likely to feel their privacy budgets were 
appropriately funded (50 percent vs. 36 percent total)
Respondents who worked in enterprises that always 
practiced privacy by design were more likely to be 
completely and very confident in the ability of their 
organizations privacy teams to ensure data privacy and 
achieve compliance with new privacy laws and regulations 
(71 percent vs. 43 percent total), but this may represent 
false confidence. Enterprises that always practice 
privacy by design were just as likely to have experienced 
a material privacy breach in the last year as the total 
respondents (11 percent for both). It is imperative that 
those practicing privacy by design understand that it does 
not make them immune to privacy breaches.
Privacy Awareness Training
Almost any employee can cause a privacy breach, so it 
is important that all staff complete privacy awareness 
training. The survey results reflect this belief as most 
survey respondents said their organizations provided 
privacy awareness training (86 percent). Figure 20 
shows how frequently respondents organizations 
provided privacy awareness training. These findings are 
comparable to last years results.
While it is slightly concerning that 9 percent of 
respondents said no privacy awareness training was 
conducted, it is possible those respondents were 
independent consultants or operated a small privacy 
consulting business comprised entirely of privacy 
experts. That said, even very small organizations
should ensure that all employees receive some kind of 
privacy training on a regular basis. Most respondents 
(71 percent) said privacy awareness training had a positive 
impact on privacy awareness in their organizations.
Providing the same training year after year will 
not provide value for employees who have already 
completed it in prior years. It is worthwhile reviewing 
and revising privacy training on a regular cadence 
to ensure it is up\-to\-date and provides meaningful 
information to staff. Figure 21 shows how frequently 
enterprises provided privacy awareness training.
Nearly half of respondents (49 percent) pointed to a 
lack of training or poor training as a common privacy 
failure. Part of reviewing privacy awareness training 
should be evaluating its effectiveness. Privacy teams 
should select metrics to evaluate training effectiveness 
and track trends over time.

The metrics respondents used to evaluate their privacy 
training programs include:
Number of employees who completed privacy 
training: 65 percent
Number of privacy incidents: 56 percent
Number of privacy complaints received from 
customers: 37 percent
Comparison of pre\-and post\-training assessments:
23 percent
Enterprises should be wary of relying solely on the number 
of privacy incidents andor complaints to measure the 
quality of privacy training. These measures are reactive; 
they indicate that an incident has occurred or a customer 
has experienced a privacy harm. The damage has been 
done, and revising privacy training after the fact likely will 
not restore consumer trust. While tracking the number 
of employees who have completed privacy awareness 
training can be valuable, it does not provide any insight 
into whether employees have learned anything, if they 
found the training useful, or if they became more capable 
of acting in ways that align with privacy objectives. Pre\- 
and post\-training assessmentseven just a few true
false questions asked before and after the trainingmay 
provide better insights on the quality of privacy training.
In some enterprises, privacy awareness training and 
security awareness training are not separated. While 
that is not necessarily a problem, it is possible that 
some enterprises consider privacy and security to 
be interchangeable. It is important that if the two 
are combined, both privacy\- and security\-specific 
information is included. Sixty percent of respondents 
separated privacy awareness training from security 
training; 29 percent did not separate them; and 6 
percent did not know if they were separated. (Five 
percent of respondents organizations did not offer 
privacy awareness training.)

Privacy Breaches
Respondents reports of privacy breaches were 
consistent with last years survey findings. As in 
2023s report, 11 percent of respondents in this years 
survey said their organizations experienced a material 
privacy breach in the last 12 months. Sixty\-three 
percent said their organizations did not, 8 percent 
preferred not to answer, and 18 percent did not know. 
The large percentage of respondents who did not 
know if their enterprises experienced a privacy breach 
signals a broader issue about breach response and 
data classification. Some organizations may know 
they experienced a breach but not know if personal 
information was compromised, which may mean data 
classification efforts need improvement.
Figure 22 shows respondents perception of breaches 
this year compared with last year. Although the percentage 
of respondents organizations that experienced a breach 
is the same as last year, only 18 percent of this years 
respondents felt they were experiencing the same number 
of breaches as last year.
There was no consensus among respondents on the 
likelihood of experiencing a material privacy breach in 
the next year, as shown in figure 23\. It is concerning that 
almost a quarter of respondents did not know the likelihood 
of experiencing a privacy breach. This may indicate that 
privacy risk is an area of growth for many enterprises, and 
it could also indicate that privacy professionals need a 
better definition of what constitutes a privacy breach.

Conclusion
Privacy laws and regulations have required many 
enterprises to prioritize privacy and expand their privacy\-
related functions. Consumers have become more 
focused on privacy, and many enterprises believe that 
their customers will not patronize them if their data is 
not properly protected.6 Enterprises that do not protect 
data are at risk of losing trust with their consumers, as 
privacy violations can result in heavy fines and reputation\-
damaging headlines.
Although many privacy teams work with limited resources, 
the ISACA survey reveals good news: Enterprises are not 
experiencing more breaches than in the past. Still, privacy 
teams are smaller this year than last year; considering 
anticipated budget cuts, privacy professionals who already 
feel their programs are underfunded are likely to experience 
more budgetary challenges in 2024\. Despite these budget 
cuts, privacy professionals who maximize the impact of 
privacy initiatives can meet their privacy objectives.
