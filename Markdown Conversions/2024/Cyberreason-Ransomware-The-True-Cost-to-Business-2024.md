Ransomware:theto business 2024Our Annual Global Study on Ransomware Business Impact
Attackers are evolving. Paying isnt the solution. Its time to reject the ransom.1ForewordIf I could have one wish for 
2024, it would be that we 
stop calling ransomware 
by the same name.It fails to describe the true impact 
of an attack. What started as the 
simplest of notionsencrypting 
data and extorting money to return 
access to itevolved into a complex 
Swiss army knife, like the blended 
attacks back in the early 2000s.Now ChatGPT has arrived on the 
scene and its driving the next 
evolution of ransomware.In last years survey, we began to see 
ransomware attackers have greater 
success in non\-English language 
countries (Italy, Germany, France 
and Japan). This trend is being 
accelerated by generative AI tools 
that enable attackers to translate and 
localize their activities faster and at 
scale. These tools also enable them toscrape public information on people 
and companies, which they use to 
develop highly personalized social 
engineering attacks. Generative AI 
also reduces the skills required to 
codify attacks, lowering the barrier 
of entry and increasing automation in 
writing attacks, especially with tools 
such as wormGPT.This years research shows that, while 
most businesses have a ransomware 
strategy in place, many are incomplete. 
Theyre either missing a documented 
plan or the right people to execute it. 
As a result, we see that many 
organizations are paying the ransom.
Likewise, whilst many have cyber 
insurance, too many simply dont 
know if or to what degree it covers 
them for ransomware attacks.This is problematic on several 
levels. Its no guarantee that your 
data and systems will be returned 
uncorrupted, that attackers wont 
sell your data on the black market, 
or that you wont be attacked again.And if theres any evidence that your 
payment was used to fund terrorism 
or organized crime, you could find 
yourself facing criminal charges.So, whats the takeaway this year? 
Its that the threat continues to evolve 
at pace while businesses ransomware 
resilience capabilities struggle to 
keep pace. Now is the time to stress 
test your capabilities, involve the rest 
of the business, and ensure you are 
sufficiently protected against todays 
attackers as well as tomorrows.Greg Day

ransomware at the top of the agenda.Ransomware attacks are becoming 
more frequent, more sophisticated, 
and more effective. This year we

happening 
and how to 
prepare for itAttackers are making use of 
generative AI and machine 
learning to find new ways into 
networks and to scale their 
activities. At the same time, 
organizations are being held 
back by several challenges.We have identified 6 core challenges and, 
while none of these are easy to overcome, 
here is some advice on how to help your 
business prepare for each.1Attackers are becoming more effective, 
thanks in part to generative AIWhats happening
Businesses everywhere are working out how best to leverage 
generative AI to become more effective and efficient at scale. 
And so are bad actors. They are using tools like ChatGPT 4\.0 to 
collect personal information, craft professional\-looking messages, 
and more effectively translate them into any language.How you can prepareEnsure all employees are aware of the increased risk 
of bad actors using these tools to create messages that 
seem less suspicious. Show them what to look out for 
and run regular drills. Make sure all teams are following 
basic good practice when it comes to security hygiene. 
And work with a cybersecurity provider to secure 
critical systems and data. Some providers are now using 
AI to automate ransomware detection and protection.102The talent gap 
continues to widenWhats happening
The global cybersecurity workforce may have reached record 
levels, but the demand for skills still far exceeds the supply of 
skilled workers. Hiring cybersecurity talent was the number one 
investment being made by our respondents, but they simply cant 
match the pace required.How you can prepareIncrease efficiency so that you can make full use of the 
cybersecurity staff you already have. This may mean 
consolidating, automating, and outsourcing various 
parts of your security and incident response capabilities.

operation\-centric approach here:cybereason.complatform\#malopIs generative AI dangerous?In February 2023, researchers from 
security firm Checkpoint discovered 
that malicious actors had been able 
to alter a chatbots API, enabling it to 
generate malware code and putting 
virus creation at the fingertips of 
almost any would\-be hacker.Hear more on 
this episode of ourMalicious Life podcast.10113Legacy systems increase 
network vulnerabilityWhats happening
While most parts of the network are being migrated to 
the cloud, many critical systems remain offline or in dark 
networks. These may seem to be less at risk from an 
attack, but theyre also less protected. And their critical 
nature makes them ideal targets for social engineers, 
who only need to find the weakest link once to access 
passwords or gain physical access.4Insurance only mitigates 
a portion of the attackWhats happening
Despite almost all respondents having cyber insurance, 
only 40% are sure that a ransomware attack would be 
covered. Only around half of those who claimed from 
their insurance after an attack recovered the full costs.How you can prepareDont ignore offline or closed systems. 
Control access, ensure they are 
password protected, and teach 
employees about the dangers of social 
engineering. Secure these systems 
by working with a cybersecurity 
provider who can deploy lightweight, 
non\-intrusive security solutions.When the Sellafield nuclear site hack was discovered, 
investigators found several weaknesses including that 
external contractors were able to plug memory sticks 
into the system while unsupervised.How you can prepareCyber insurance mitigates a portion 
of the total impact of an attack, 
so take the time to fully understand 
your organizations cyber insurance 
policy(ies) against the true cost of 
a breach.125 Defenders need helpplanning for the next attackWhats happening
Despite the high chance of falling victim to another attack, 
only 41% of organizations are ready for the next attack and 
the biggest gap is in the planning.How you can prepareFocus on what you can control with 
the resources available to you today. 
The best way to start is by pressure 
testing your current incident response 
plan. Consider working with a cybersecurity 
partner to conduct a ransomware risk 
assessment. The assessment should 
consist of tabletop exercises that simulate 
a ransomware attack and test the people, 
process, and technological aspects of 
your plan. The results will show you how 
to direct your resources.6It still doesnt 
pay to payWhats happening
84% of respondents said their organization paid the 
ransom. This makes sense of our finding that opening 
a cryptocurrency wallet is a popular investment. 
Unfortunately, most of those who paid didnt get their 
systems and data back uncorrupted. And 78% were held 
to ransom again, with 63% saying they were asked to pay 
more the second time around.How you can prepareAs we have seen for the last two years 
running, it still does not pay to pay. 
Prevention is always better than cure. 
Put a stop to ransomware breaches by 
partnering with a cybersecurity leader 
with specific ransomware protection 
technology. When potential losses are 
predicted to reach millions of dollars, you 
cant afford not to protect your business.1213Conclusion: Its time to reject the ransomOnce again, we see that paying millions of dollars 
to ransomware attackers is not always the solution. 
It doesnt guarantee that you will get all your systems 
and data back uncorrupted, that your data wont be sold 
on the black market, or that you wont be attacked again. 
If anything, this survey shows that once a weakness 
has been identified, youre likely to be attacked again.A much better approach to the scourge of ransomware 
is to make your business invincible to attacks. And you 
can. But first, you need to help the business understand 
the true risk and impact of an attack.Help the business understand the real risk 
of an attackInvest in ransomware talent, planning 
and technologyYou can use the findings of this survey to help 
your business understand the true risk and 
cost of a successful breach by ransomware 
attackers. This should quickly raise the 
issue to the top of the agenda and help you 
secure sufficient investment to bolster the 
organizations security position.The tabletop exercises recommended in the 
previous section of this report will help you 
identify the weaknesses in your protection and 
response planning. We recommend working 
with cybersecurity provider to cover all your 
bases, but here are some recommendations
on how to get started:PeopleProcessTechnologyHire a cybersecurity expert with experience 
in ransomware protection and empower 
them to do more with less by automating 
the protection of your data and systems. 
Consider outsourcing elements of your 
security operations to fill any gaps, such as 
out\-of\-hours monitoring, or threat detection 
and response services that can isolate 
machines automatically in the earliest 
stages of an attack.Work with the business to ensure it commits 
resources to proper planning. Be sure to 
engage all aspects of the business, including 
the Board (clarify who is responsible 
for decision\-making and that they are 
contactable after hours), PR and Marketing 
(for crisis management and customer 
communications), etc. Test your plans regularly.Turn the tables by investing in the very latest 
technology. Ensure it covers both online and 
offline networks. And look for ransomware\-
specific solutions that protect at every 
stage of an attack and include a roll\-back for 
any impacted files as a last line of defense. 
Work with your vendor to deploy managed 
detection and response services with 
24x7x365 monitoring, helping to detect, halt 
and even remediate attacks within moments, 
no matter when they occur.14Make your businessinvinciblewith AI\-powered protectionWith multi\-layered protection, AI\-powered endpoints, visibility
