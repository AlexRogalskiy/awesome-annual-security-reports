Introduction
Offensive cybersecurity practices like pen testing stand apart from other security 
methods. Unlike traditional defensive measures that are often forced to react to 
threats as they arise, offensive security can take advantage of the calm and focus 
that comes with planning and taking action before an attack has been launched. 
However, determining the most effective strategies while navigating the static 
of emerging threats, new security measures, and countless techniques can be a 
daunting task. 
By learning how other organizations are utilizing penetration testing, we gain 
valuable perspectives on the efficacy of different approaches, challenges 
encountered, and lessons learned. Sharing knowledge empowers cybersecurity 
professionals to make informed decisions that align with their organizations 
unique needs.
With this in mind, Fortras Core Security developed a penetration testing survey to 
collect, analyze, and distribute information about how cybersecurity professionals 
are using penetration testing and other proactive solutions. 
Now in its fifth year, this survey continues to track year\-over\-year changes, trends, 
challenges, and areas of development. The information collected is a valuable 
resource for cybersecurity professionals who are committed to growing and 
maintaining a proactive, resilient security posture. This report aims to add insights 
into the current state of pen testing practices, providing ongoing, useful data on 
the following key issues related to pen testing:
 
Effectiveness of pen testing in breach prevention
 
Top security concerns like phishing, ransomware, and lack of patching
 
Challenges with pen testing like personnel shortages and lack of 
remediation resources
 
Relevant regulations and compliance concerns
 
Usage of in\-house pen testing teams
 
Selecting third\-party teams
 
Evaluating pen testing toolsets
 
Other security assessment tools like vulnerability scanning and red teaming
 
Vendor consolidation
 
Pen testing in different environments
In addition to examining this years findings, well provide a comparison with 2023s

The results of this years survey show the continued value that organizations find 
in penetration testing. With every category experiencing a sizeable boost from last 
year, organizations may also be discovering an increasing number of use cases for 
pen testing. 
Assessing risk and prioritizing vulnerabilities for remediation is the primary 
objective of pen testing and a foundational offensive security practice. So, it is 
unsurprising that it has continued to be the most common response (82%) (Figure 
1\). The 12% increase from last year may be tied to the similarly sized increases 
reflected in those who use pen testing for external compliance (72%) and internal 
mandates (54%). Organizations that began using pen testing as a way to maintain 
and prove adherence may have quickly realized that penetration testing is much 
more than just a box to be ticked. Pen testing provides uniquely in\-depth analysis 
on the potential impact of vulnerabilities being exploited. This gives insights into 
which weaknesses are causing the most risk, providing the most strategic path 
forward in closing security gaps.
Perhaps the greatest proof of the value of penetration testing is that 72% of 
respondents felt that pen testing has prevented a breach at their organization 
(Figure 2\). This underscores the importance of proactive efforts that identify and 
address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. 
It is worth noting that the second most common value that respondents found 
in pen testing was its role in supporting existing vulnerability management 
programs (74%) (Figure 1\). While some organizations may rely solely on one 
proactive solution, like pen testing, it is vital to recognize the value of layering 
offensive security. Incorporating pen testing into a unified, tactical program with 
complementary solutions like vulnerability scanning and red teaming enables 
organizations to enhance coverage and efficacy.

Common Security Concerns
Phishing (80%) and ransomware (72%) were once again the top security concerns 
(Figure 3\) for survey participants. Phishing and ransomware have remained the 
top two concerns for the past three years, and for good reason. The Anti\-Phishing 
Working Group reported that 2023 was the worst year on record for phishing, with 
over five million phishing attacks observed.
Ransomware has also been on the rise in the past year, with SANS reporting a 73% 
increase in ransomware attacks. Phishing is the most common delivery method 
for ransomware, so its expected that these two closely tied threats continue to 
dominate the concerns of security professionals.
What makes phishing and ransomware such pervasive threats? A few reasons:
\* Kits and services offered on the dark webhave a low barrier to entry that even 
allows attackers with limited skills to use them. 
\* Decentralized operations and the complexity of prosecuting international crime 
make ransomware and phishing fairly low risk, and potentially very high reward. 
\* Phishing and ransomware capitalize on human error, which is challenging to 
prevent and makes them universal methods that can target every industry.
As these threats continue to pay off year after year, its unlikely that attackers will 
drop these techniques anytime soon. Consequently, organizations need to be 
equally committed to proactive security practices like pen testing to reduce risk as 
much as possible.
And speaking of the need for proactive security, lack of patching (66%) is the third 
most common concernup 17% from last year (Figure 3\). When vulnerabilities are 
discovered, the only way to ensure an attacker cant exploit it is to apply a patch as 
soon as it is available. And with over 1000 vulnerabilities in CISAs Known Exploited 
Vulnerabilities Catalog, the need for applying timely updates is more critical than 
ever. Though it seems a simple enough practice, there are multiple challenges 
that may prevent routine patching at an organization. A lack of personnel can 
cause patching to become deprioritized. Compatibility issues and downtime
disruption to business may also cause delays. And the increasing complexity of 
IT environments means that IT and security professionals are facing hundreds of 
patches. Organizations should enlist the aid of vulnerability management and pen 
testing tools, which can automate scanning, prioritize patches based on risk, and 
ensure that theyve been properly implemented. 
With attackers continuously adapting their techniques to bypass security controls 
and exploit emerging vulnerabilities, the concern over phishing, ransomware, lack 
of patching, and other security threats is certainly not unwarranted.However, 
security experts are not being idle they are also refining their strategies, regularly 
engaging in collaborative efforts, and leveraging new research. And by having 
offensive and defensive tools, engaging in regular blue team training, and fostering 
a culture of vigilance, organizations can do their part to stay ahead of attackers.

General Pen Testing Challenges
Though pen testing is clearly a valuable offensive security practice, deploying and 
managing pen testing initiatives do come with challenges. The lack of resources 
to act on findingsperform remediation is still the most common challenge 
respondents faced (62%), up 6% from last year (Figure 4\). This can occur for a 
variety of reasons. In certain cases, decision makers may not fully understand the 
urgency or severity of pen test findings. Particularly when pen tests are being run 
for regulatory adherence, there may be a misperception that meeting compliance 
mandates means the organization is fully secure. If changes are substantial and 
could cause disruption to regular business operations, there may also be hesitancy 
from decision makers to approve changes that need to be made. But the most 
common reason is simply that limited budgets and personnel create competing 
priorities and remediation falls through the cracks. 
In addition to advocating for more support for remediation efforts, security teams 
should make sure that their remediation plans are as clearly outlined as their pen 
testing plans. While good pen test reports include follow\-up recommendations, 
a remediation plan should be fleshed out in more detail. This includes outlining 
the specific steps required to address the highest priority risks, resources needed, 
timelines, and dependencies.
The inability to hire skilled personnel (34%) and the lack of qualified third parties 
(34%) are both likely continued evidence of the cybersecurity skills gap (Figure 
4\). Penetration testing seems particularly affected by this ongoing shortage. 
According to (ISC)s 2023 Cybersecurity Workforce Study, penetration testing was 
the fourth most common skill that SOC teams were missing. The lack of qualified 
third parties certainly indicates that demand outweighs supply.
Even when pen testing services are available, this does not necessary mean they 
are qualified. Unfortunately, there are pen testing teams whose services consist 
of little more than a few automated scans. They may use deceptive marketing 
tactics, such as offering unrealistically low prices or fake testimonials. Additionally, 
malicious actors have begun creating fake companies and posing as legitimate 
penetration testing firms to gain access to sensitive information or credentials. This 
underscores the need for organizations to carefully vet potential providers to make 
sure theyre selecting a reputable team with adequate experience. Joining the 
growing wait list may be frustrating, but it certainly beats getting scammed.

Compliance and Pen Testing
Unsurprisingly, PCI DSS is the most common regulation for which respondents 
reported using pen testing (43%) (Figure 5\). While most regulations require security 
assessments, PCI DSS explicitly requires penetration testing. Requirement 11\.3 
mandates that organizations perform external and internal penetration testing at 
least annually and after any significant infrastructure or application change.
Even when not explicitly required, pen tests are commonly used to fulfill security 
assessment requirements and help verify adherence to other regulations, proving 
to auditors or other authorities that mandated security measures are in place or 
working properly. Up 11% from last year (figure 6\), more organizations are having to 
increase the number of pen tests they are running, likely because of updates and 
additions in cybersecurity law and regulation.
Compliance initiatives have become a global priority, with more changes expected 
in the coming years. The updated Network and Information Security Directive 
(NIS2\) expanded its requirements for risk management and is required to be 
transposed into the national law of all EU member countries by October 2024\. The 
Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) will add risk management requirements 
to financial institutions beginning in 2025\. According to Gartner, 75% of the global 
population will have its personal data under privacy regulations by the end of 2024\. 
Interestingly, there was a 23% increase in respondents that needed to broaden 
the scope of their penetration tests (Figure 6\). There may be a few reasons for 
this. For example, supply chain attacks have led to more scrutiny over third party 
risk management, so organizations may feel more pressure to include third\-party 
systems and networks in engagements. Additionally, if new or updated regulations 
are requiring organizations to assess more systems, budget constraints may 
lead them to broaden the scope instead of increasing the number of tests theyre 
running.
Other common alterations in pen testing strategies included additional emphasis 
on network security tests (36%) and phishing campaignssocial engineering (30%).Down 7% from last year, only 9% of participants reported that there was no impact 
to their pen testing strategies as a result of compliance needs, illustrating the 
ongoing influence compliance continues to have on pen testing approaches.

Phishing
With estimates of over three billion phishing emails sent per day, its no wonder that 
phishing was the most common security concern of respondents (80%) (Figure 3\). 
Though phishing attacks are nothing new, attackers are always finding ways to 
change up their tactics. For example, generative AI has led to an explosion of 
phishing emails, with a 1,265% increase in malicious emails since 2022\. Business 
Email Compromise (BEC) attacks have also become increasingly common, with 
the FBI receiving 21,489 complaints in 2023 alone. And the top social engineering 
threat last year was hybrid vishing. This multi\-staged attack strategy typically uses 
a spoofed email that requests the victim to follow up via phone. This enables the 
attacker to bypass basic security filters, since the payload is only a phone number. 
As phishing is more widespread than ever, it was disappointing to see a downward 
trend in the frequency of social engineering exercises. Quarterly exercises were 
down 7%, while there was a 6% increase in participants who never run these 
exercises (Figure 7\). Though these arent huge shifts, given the prevalence of these 
attacks, social engineering exercises should only be on the rise. 
Simulation exercises are one of the only ways to reduce the risk of social 
engineering attacks. There is a common misperception that these exercises 
are limited to raising awareness among employees about the tactics used by 
attackers. However, phishing simulations help validate security practices, providing 
data on how well email filters are detecting phishing emails and measuring the 
efficacy of training programs. They can also help improve incident response, 
ensuring that security teams can respond effectively to real phishing attacks.

Penetration Testing Frequency
As with phishing campaigns, there was a slight drop in general pen testing 
frequency, with a 9% decrease in quarterly tests, a 5% increase in organizations 
that test a couple times a year (43%), and a 3% increase in organizations that 
never pen test (17%) (Figure 8\).
There is no magic number when it comes to pen testing frequency. Instead, 
it depends on the size of the organization, the complexity of its technical 
infrastructure, the type of data it handles, and applicable compliance regulations. 
Most organizations should be running at least once a year, but additional 
tests should be run if substantial changes are made to the IT environment, if 
vulnerabilities are discovered, or if a security incident has occurred. 
Another reason to consider more than one test a year is to get assurance that 
the vulnerabilities identified during the initial penetration test have been properly 
addressed and remediated. This includes confirming the proper implementation 
of patches and the effectiveness of new security controls like firewalls, intrusion 
detectionprevention systems, and access controls.
Retesting in a timely manner ensures that fixes dont become new flaws. However, 
it is still difficult to get them approved, as evidenced by respondents encountering 
challenges with the lack of follow up after pen testing (62%) (Figure 4\). Retesting 
can often be viewed as less urgent, with many stakeholders seeing initial efforts as 
sufficient or having reluctance about needing to make additional changes. 
Ultimately, though both testing and retesting should be run more often, best 
practices often collide with the real\-world practicalities of resources and budgets. 
In such cases, taking a layered approach to proactive security can be an effective 
approach, as vulnerability management solutions can help fill in gaps between 
pen tests. These solutions are typically highly automated and can easily be 
scheduled to run on a daily or weekly basis. This ensures that the organization can 
stay up to date with some form of assessment.

Have you ever had an in\-house 
penetration testing team?
Organizations may decide to add in\-house pen testing capabilities for several 
reasons. An in\-house pen testing team has more familiarity with the business 
operations and IT infrastructure, making it easier to tailor testing methodologies 
and approaches to suit the organizations specific security needs. They can also 
run tests more frequently, allowing them to bring attention to emerging threats 
in a timely manner, potentially take part in the remediation process, and retest to 
ensure any fixes were appropriately implemented. 
This year shows a 15% decrease in the number of respondents who have in\-
house pen testing teams (Figure 9\). However, the percentage of participants who 
no longer have teams stayed flat at 14%, so it does not appear to indicate that 
organizations are finding in\-house pen testing less helpful. Instead, this decrease 
may be explained by the 16% increase in respondents that leverage third parties 
exclusively (Figure 10\). 
The most common reason organizations dont have in\-house pen testing is a lack 
of need for a full\-time pen testerteam (55%) (Figure 10\). Smaller organizations 
may have relatively simple IT environments or a small attack surface, making the 
need for frequent or extensive penetration testing less apparent. They also might 
not have the foundational security controls, security awareness, or resources to 
be at the security maturity level that is required to begin pen testing. Alternatively, 
organizations may find their needs sufficiently met by having pen testing be one 
aspect of a broader cybersecurity role. 
Having more general cybersecurity roles has been a common way for 
organizations to cope with the cybersecurity skills gap. The skills gap is also the 
second most common reason for not having an in\-house pen testing team (39%) 
(Figure 10\). According to (ISC)s 2023 Cybersecurity Workforce Study, the skills gap 
continues to widen, growing 12\.6% from last year with a record high shortage of 
nearly four million.

Third Party Services
Third\-party pen testing dramatically increased this year, with 92% of respondents 
leveraging third\-party teams in some capacity (Figure 11\). As discussed earlier, this 
aligns with the 16% increase in respondents that leverage third parties exclusively 
(Figure 10\).
The top reason third\-party services are solicited is still because of their external, 
objective point of view (62%) (Figure 13\). Since security teams are so familiar with 
their own infrastructures, third\-party services can help uncover blind spots, biases, 
and assumptions that internal personnel may overlook. Additionally, since third\-
party services focus solely on testing, they are often more up to date on emerging 
threats, attack trends, and best practices. Though different skillsets seem to go 
hand\-in\-hand with an external point of view, there was a 17% dip in participants 
using third\-party services for their different skillsets (33%). Perhaps participants 
assumed that this option was only relevant to organizations with in\-house testers, 
since different may be interpreted as different from the skillsets of the in\-house 
pen testing team.If this is the case, the reduction in in\-house team use would 
explain this drop.
There was an 11% increase in the use of third\-party services for compliance 
(56%) (Figure 13\). This aligns with the increase in the number of pen tests run 
for compliance (Figure 6\). Compliance is also frequently cited as the reason 
organizations rotate vendors. However, it is unclear just how often organizations 
should be changing vendors. This may explain why there is so much variation, 
with 24% never switching, 38% switching every 2\-3 years, 18% switching every year, 
and 20% switching after every test (Figure 12\). The truth is, no regulation explicitly 
requires organizations to switch out vendors, its just a generally recommended 
practice. 
That said, with the challenges to find qualified third\-party teams (Figure 4\) 
and the desire to consolidate vendors (Figure 22\), organizations may find it 
beneficial to find vendors with large teams. Organizations can leverage internal 
rotation to ensure that different team members are assigned to conduct 
testing engagements, which allows for fresh perspectives, varied expertise, and 
independent assessmentsall with a single, trusted vendor. 
Organizations may also still benefit from adding some component of internal 
pen testing. In\-house testing can be particularly helpful for retesting purposes. It 
may be difficult to justify to stakeholders the need to hire a third\-party service to 
come back so soon to validate remediation efforts. Having a general cybersecurity 
professional assume pen testing duties may be an easier case to make. 
Additionally, having someone who can use pen testing tools may be especially 
useful if organizations continue to face the challenge of finding qualified third 
parties (Figure 4\). If the wait for availability proves longer than anticipated, an in\-
house pen tester can help bridge the gap.

Pen Testing Tools
Penetration testing tools are a wide\-ranging category and can include specialized 
tools like port scanners, password crackers, or SQL injection tools, as well as more 
comprehensive tools that offer multiple features to centralize the testing process. 
Pen testing tools are often divided into two categories: open\-source and enterprise. 
Open\-source tools are typically developed and maintained by the cybersecurity 
community. Enterprise tools are commercial solutions offered by cybersecurity 
vendors. While open\-source tools are free to use, they often lack advanced 
features and cant offer extensive support. Enterprise tools do come with a price 
tag, but they tend to offer features designed to meet compliance regulations and 
keep up with the needs of complex IT environments.
This year 28% of respondents do not use pen testing tools at alla noteworthy 
27% increase (Figure 14\). This is at least partially due the decrease in respondents 
with in\-house pen testing teams (Figure 9\). However, this increase, in addition to 
the rise in the use of only open\-source tools (33%) (Figure 14\) and the increased 
percentage of respondents that see cost as a top criteria (75%) (Figure 16\), is 
also likely reflective of inflation and global economic volatility. With cybersecurity 
budget growth falling by 65% last year, many organizations may be relying more 
on open\-source when possible. 
However, there is still strong interest in commercial pen testing tools, particularly 
in the featuresfunctionality they can offer (73%) (Figure 16\). Reporting (65%), 
templatesautomation capabilities (65%), and having an extensive threat library 
(65%) are the top three sought after capabilities in paid penetration testing tools 
(Figure 15\). Reporting is essential to both verify and prove compliance to security 
regulations. Automation capabilities not only fully automate basic tests, but they 
can also enable a hybrid pen testing model. Automation takes care of routine 
tasks, allowing a tester to focus on more complex issues. This speeds up the testing 
process without increasing headcount or sacrificing accuracy. Lastly, an extensive 
threat library provides access to expertly written exploits that are regularly kept up 
to date, making the pen testing process more efficient and safer.

Penetration testing is just one part of offensive security and should be part of a 
strong portfolio of solutions that focus on prevention and continuous improvement 
of an organizations security posture. The most foundational tool in offensive 
security are vulnerability scanners, which identify, assess, and report security 
vulnerabilities within an IT infrastructures network or applications. Since they 
are automated, vulnerability scanners typically provide the most up\-to\-date 
picture of an organizations security posture. Adding penetration testing is a 
logical next phase, since the data vulnerability scans provide can be used to 
inform penetration tests, providing insights into which weaknesses should be 
explored further. 77% of survey participants that have used pen testing also have 
vulnerability scanners (Figure 18\). Interestingly, 85% of respondents that do not 
use pen testing do have vulnerability scanners (Figure 17\). Their interest in taking a 
survey on pen testing indicates that they are beginning to consider expanding their 
offensive security portfolio. 
Security awareness training (66%) is another foundational offensive security tool. 
These training sessions are typically required for all personnel at an organization, 
so they help promote a culture of security and ensure that everyone is familiar with 
security best practices. Since training is one of the only ways to reduce the risk of 
social engineering attacks, research is regularly being done on how to best convey 
these critical lessons in an efficient, memorable manner. Gamification, responsive 
design, and varied media formats are just a few of the ways that training continues 
to evolve.
SAST (32%) and DAST (27%), both used for testing applications, demonstrate 
how proactive security can be integrated into the development process. Post\-
exploitation (20%), red teaming (27%) and adversary simulation (23%) are typically 
only used by more mature programs, so participants may not yet be at this stage 
in their security journey. Even those that have reached advanced maturity levels 
may exclusively use red teaming services.
75% of respondents had cost as a top criterion when considering proactive 
solutions (Figure 19\). While cost is always a primary concern, 2023 was especially 
challenging. As noted earlier, inflation and other economic concerns have 
impacted cybersecurity budgets. This trend is likely to continue, with a predicted 
41% cut in cybersecurity spending this year. As a result, organizations have to 
carefully scrutinize each purchasea difficult task when no aspect of cybersecurity 
feels like it can be deemed optional.

Red Teaming
Penetration tests and red team engagements are often conflated, with many using 
the terms interchangeably. However, there are significant differences between the 
two. Red teaming involves realistic simulations of cyber\-attacks, while pen tests 
offer a more targeted approach, focusing on exploiting vulnerabilities on specific 
systems, networks, or applications. The goal of red teaming is to test organizational 
defenses and improve blue team responses, while the goal of pen testing is to 
assess the effectiveness of security controls. A layered offensive security strategy 
includes both of these complementary security assessments to close security gaps 
and enhance their technical defenses.
It makes sense that only 41% of respondents conduct or utilize red team services 
(Figure 20\), since red teaming should be reserved for organizations that have 
reached a fairly advanced security maturity level. While most participants (67%) 
found red team engagements effective at preventing breaches (Figure 21\), those 
who found them ineffective may not have been mature enough to fully benefit 
from them. If an organization hasnt yet implemented advanced threat detection 
or does not have incident response capabilities in place, theyre not ready to 
practice responding to a live attack simulation.

Vendor Consolidation
Vendor consolidation continues to be of interest to respondents, with 84% 
saying it is at least somewhat important to their organization (Figure 22\). Vendor 
consolidation offers several advantages. As IT infrastructures become more 
complex, organizations have found increasing amounts of time dedicated to the 
unanticipated task of managing numerous vendors. Dealing with fewer vendors 
simplifies management and reduces time spent on related administrative 
tasks. Developing relationships with a select number of vendors can also lead to 
smoother communication and easier contract negotiations.
Having multiple vendors may also unintentionally add more risk, especially with 
the dramatic increase in supply chain attacks last year. In fact, according to 
Gartner, 60% of supply chain organizations will use cybersecurity risk as a factor 
in determining which third\-parties they work with. With an increased need for due 
diligence and risk assessment before entering into a contract, having a smaller set 
of trusted vendors can significantly increase efficiency.
Vendor consolidation can also incentivize organizations to mature their security 
strategies. 85% of participants that dont currently use pen testing said that 
they would consider adding proactive solutions if a current vendor offered them 
(Figure 23\). Solutions offered by an existing vendor are especially advantageous 
when they offer interoperability and integration between products, which can 
simplify initial deployment, streamline operations, and reduce complexity. When 
organizations begin looking for vendors that offer the solution they are currently 
looking for, it may be prudent to find those that also provide additional options for 
future investments.

Pen Testing in Different Environments
With its ubiquity across various organizational assets, including workstations, 
servers, and other endpoints, Windows (82%) once again stands out as the 
predominant operating system of concern (Figure 24\). Windows Active Directory 
is a high\-value target for attackers, as it serves as the centralized repository for 
authentication, authorization, and configuration information. If Active Directory is 
compromised, threat actors can have full control of the entire network, so securing 
Windows environments and safeguarding Active Directory against exploitation is 
crucial for minimizing cybersecurity risks and protecting organizational assets.
Web applications remain common environments for pen testing, but the 15% 
increase from last year is worth noting (Figure 24\). It may reflect the increase in 
participants from the finance industry, whose web applications became an even 
more popular target last year (Figure 29\). In fact, web application attacks were 
responsible for 77% of all breaches in the finance and insurance sector, according 
to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR). Additionally, the DBIR found 
that 95% of attacks were financially motivated, making financial applications 
particularly tempting, as they can store bank account numbers, credit card details, 
Social Security numbers, and transaction history. 
The 20% increase in pen testing for cloud infrastructures (Figure 25\) was a 
promising change, especially as cloud environments become increasingly 
relied upon. For example, cloud native computing grew 175% from 2022 to 2023\. 
Unfortunately, an upward trend in use typically means an upward trend in attacks. 
Sure enough, over 80% of data breaches last year involved data storage in the 
cloud. Organizations would be wise to continue including cloud environments in 
their pen testing strategies.

Conclusion
The results of this survey highlight the importance of pen testing as a strategic 
component of an organizations proactive cybersecurity portfolio. Just as pen test 
assess infrastructure security, organizations must also regularly evaluate their pen 
testing approach, carefully considering the available tools and methodologies 
to ensure they are effectively addressing their unique security needs and 
requirements.
Pen testing programs are not without their obstacles. The pervasiveness of limited 
resources was evident throughout the survey analysis, with fewer in\-house pen 
testing teams, more organizations going without any commercial pen testing 
tools, and cost becoming the top criterion for both pen testing solutions and 
other proactive security tools. Though organizations may be able to reduce costs 
through vendor consolidation, continuing financial challenges may require difficult 
decisions about how many tests to run, how extensive they should be, and who 
should be running them. 
But the importance of penetration testing extends beyond the immediate scope 
of the tests themselves. Incorporating pen testing in any form opens the door to 
adopting a proactive security mindset.
