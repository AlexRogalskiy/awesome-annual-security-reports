VP Research, Check PointIn 1976, Queen Elizabeth II sent the first royal email. It was sent over ARPANET,7 years before the internet was invented, and a long 13 years before the firstrecorded internet hack.Almost 50 years later, email has evolved into a popular communication method,and the most popular vehicle for threat actors to initiate their attacks. In fact,the Check Point Research (cp) annual Security Report shows that in 2022,the proportion of email\-delivered\-attacks has increased, reaching a staggeringrecord of 86% of all file\-based attacks in\-the\-wild.In our Security Report, we discuss a few more trends observed by cpthroughout the year. The Russia\-Ukraine war demonstrated how the traditional,kinetic, war can be augmented by a cybernetic war. It has also influenced thebroader threat landscape in the rapid changes of hacktivism and how independentthreat actors choose to work for state\-affiliated missions. The war has also seenenhanced usage of wiper malware, and this trend has been adopted by severalactors, reaching a point where 2022 has seen more wiper attacks globally, than inthe previous decade altogether. Traditional cybercrime has also changedin 2022,threat actors started using more legitimate tools in their operations, includingnative operating system files, IT software and penetration testing tools, all helpingthem in their efforts to stay under the radar. In their ransomware attacks, threatactors are starting to skip the encryption process, realizing that the financialrewards comes mostly from data breaches and the threat to publish victim data.In attacks on mobile devices, attackers make a habit out of mimicking legitimateapplications, and in the cloud threat landscapecompanies data is at risk mostlywhen hosted by third parties, and susceptible to attacks due to misconfigurations,over\-permissive roles and permissions, and access keys stored publicly.55CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R1In the last days of 2022, we witnessed a dramatic advancement in the field ofgenerative artificial intelligence, now widely available to the public, and which isable to generate highly professional text (code included) on demand in seconds.As we step into 2023, we should keep in mind that this technology may quicklybe adopted by threat actors, to craft even more malicious emails, in even betterquality than those typically authored by threat actors, and with endless variationsof malware and malicious code in general. This comes to prove, yet again, theimportance of zero day prevention of attacks, across the entire IT infrastructure,including email, endpoint, network, cloud, and everything in between.Check Point Software is committed to ensuring our customers are providedthe best and prevention\-first security across all these vectors. At Check PointResearch, we are happy to provide this annual Security Report to help inraising awareness and vigilance, so that we can all join hands in preventingthe next cyberattack.Maya HorowitzVP Research at Check Point Software Technologies66CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R2TIMELINE

Initially discovered in 2014 as a banking Trojan, Emotet hasdeveloped into a significant multipurpose malware, serving as an initial accessmalware and used by sophisticated Eastern European cyber criminals. Identifiedas one of the major cyber threats, Emotet was taken down in January 2021, on aglobal law enforcement operation, only to resurge by the end of that year. On itsreturn Emotet was distributed with Trickbots assistance and later deployed largescale spam campaigns with malicious Office documents. Relying heavily on Officemacros exploitations, Microsofts intension to disable VBA macros in documentsobtained from the internet was expected to affect Emotets distribution. Emotetsoperators prepared for the change, experimenting with alternative file typesincluding .lnk, .xll zip and .iso files. In November, Emotet returned from one ofits routine breaks, and went back to its previous weapon of choiceExcel fileswith malicious macros. To bypass the Mark\-of\-the\-Web limitations, the attachedmaldocs displayed detailed instructions directing users to copy the files intothe trusted Templates folder. Emotet continues to use email threads hijackingtechnique and customizes email content according to the targeted country. Emotetwas observed deploying other malware families like IcedID and XMRig on victimsystem. Other Emotet campaigns in 2022 include a campaign targeting IKEAemployees; a US phishing campaign impersonating the IRS during the 2022 taxseason and many more.Infostealers occupied a central place in this years table, with four of the mostcommonly used stealers, AgentTesla, Formbook, SnakeKeylogger and LokiBotoccupying the top six places in our top malware list. The popularity of infostealersis connected to the growing market for stolen credentials and their availabilityto threat actors for relatively low prices. One of the emerging techniques ofcyber cybercriminals is using infostealers for widely spread infections thatare not specifically focused on corporate networks. After the initial infection,cybercriminals mine the data to identify corporate VPN credentials, which willallow them to get an initial access to corporate networks.5454CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R4TOP MULTIPURPOSE MALWAREGLOBALAMERICAS22%3%

Comparisons in this category therefore relateto the last midyear report rather than to older annual data.Emotet and Qbot have increased their relative activity and now comprise of morethan 60% of infection attempts in this category. Raspberry Robin is a new entrantto the multipurpose list. First detected in September 2021 using infected USBdevices and wormable capabilities to spread, Raspberry Robin has become oneof the largest active malware distribution platforms within a year. It was reportedto deploy various other malware families, including IcedID, Bumblebee andransomware brands like Clop and LockBit. With possible relations to Evil Corpthis malware constitutes a serious new threat.The Phorpiex botnet, which has been known for distributing other malwarefamilies via spam campaigns, as well as for fueling large\-scale spam, sextortioncampaigns and ransomware spread, started 2022 with crypto\-transaction hijackingand continues its expansion, occupying the fourth place in the multipurpose table.Glupteba has fully returned from the 2021 takedown operation carried out byGoogle. This malware features a variety of capabilities including a credentialstealer, crypto miner, router exploiter and more. However, Glupteba is best knownfor its use of the bitcoin blockchain technology as its C\&C infrastructure to receiveconfiguration information. Gluptebas use of bitcoin records improves its resilienceagainst takedowns, since the blockchain transactions cannot be deleted, howeverthey remain exposed for public inspection.

Check Pointdata reveals a steady increase in infostealers use, affecting 18% of corporatenetworks in 2020, 21% in 2021 and reaching as much as 24% of all organizations in2022\. Infostealers are sold on underground forums for a monthly subscription feethat ranges between $60 to $1,000, to threat actors of varying levels of technicalknowledge. This market, which was previously divided between multiple smallermalware families, has consolidated and this year three brands, AgentTesla,Formbook and SnakeKeylogger are responsible for 71% of Check Point monitoredinfostealers attacks.Formbook, detected in 20% of infostealer cases is a commodity malwaresold as\-a\-service on underground forums since 2016\. It is designed to collectkeystrokes, search and access files, take screenshots, harvest browsercredentials and download and deploy additional payloads. It has been usedby multiple actors, often distributed using email attachments including pdf,doc, RTF document, exe, zip, rar etc. Formbook has been deployed this yeartargeting Ukraine and in numerous other campaigns.The SnakeKeylogger modular .NET infostealer has tripled its rank compared toour 2021 top malware statistics. Snake first surfaced around late 2020, and quicklygrew in popularity among cyber criminals. Snakes main functionalities includerecording keystrokes, taking screenshots, harvesting credentials and clipboardcontent, in addition to supporting exfiltration of the stolen data by both HTTP andSMTP protocols. In August, researchers observed SnakeKeylogger in malspamcampaign spreading via phishing emails to target IT firms located in the US.5858CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R4TOP CRYPTOMINING MALWAREGLOBALAMERICAS1%5%8%10%1%4%4%7%XMRigLemonDuckWannamineKinsingOther76%XMRigLemonDuckWannamineLuciferOther84%Figure 25: Top cryptomining malware globallyFigure 26: Top cryptomining malware in the AmericasEUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (EMEA)ASIA PACIFIC (APAC)2% 6%

CVE\-2021\-34523 AND CVE\-2021\-31207\)This is the name given to an attack\-chain which exploits three vulnerabilitiesin Microsofts Exchange Server. Combining these vulnerabilities allowsunauthenticated attackers to perform Remote Code Execution (RCE) on vulnerableservers. All three vulnerabilities have been reported and patched in 2021 theyremain at the top of the most exploited vulnerabilities list even in 2022\. Some ofthe reasons for their popularity with attackers are their simple exploitation, theprevalence of MS Exchange servers with government and large businesses andthe fact they were thoroughly analyzed, and discussed by researchers. CheckPoint data shows that 21% of our customers have been impacted with ProxyShellattempts in 2022\. ProxyShell vulnerabilities have been exploited for a variety ofmotivations including by financially motivated threat actors to deploy ransomware,for espionage in the Middle East and Africa and by Iranian APT entities to gainaccess to American, Australian, Canadian and UK entities. Check Point IncidentResponse Team (CPIRT) investigations found ProxyShell exploitations in onein every six attack cases. Together with ProxyLogon and the recently reportedProxyNotShell, these MS Exchange vulnerabilities constitute a significant attacksurface, frequently exploited in the wild, often resulting in major breaches.6464CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023 
CHAPTE R5FOLLINA IN MICROSOFT OFFICE (CVE\-2022\-30190\)Reported in May 2022, this vulnerability in Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool(MSDT) is exploited using Microsoft Office documents. Microsoft has gone along way in their effort to reduce attacks utilizing office documents by disablingmacros in documents from external sources. Exploiting the new Follinavulnerability, attackers are now using specially crafted .docx and .rtf documentsto download and execute malicious code even in Protected Mode and when macrosare disabled. Despite Microsofts mitigation efforts, threat actors have exploitedFollina in unpatched systems to deploy Qbot, and other RATs, making Follinaone the most frequently used vulnerability discovered in 2022 contributing tothe popularity of malicious office docs.FORTINET CVE\-2022\-40684 AND CVE\-2022\-42475Two critical bugs reported in October (CVSS score: 9\.6\) and December (CVSS score:9\.3\) in Fortinet products allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrarycode via specially crafted requests.

In addition to the vulnerabilitiesreviewed above, the Atlassian Confluence RCE (CVE\-2022\-26134\) and F5 BIG IP(CVE\-2022\-1388\) reviewed in our midyear report contributed their share tonew exploitation attempts. Our data shows that vulnerabilities reported in thelast three years made up 24% percent of exploitation attempts compared toonly 18% in 2021\. This indicates an upgrade in threat actors competence andintegration ability, especially manifested in cloud based attacks, with 27% ofthe attacks leveraging new vulnerabilities (2020\-2022\). Exploitation of oldervulnerabilities continued with widely used 2017 CVEs including, Apache Struts26666CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R5Remote Code Execution (CVE\-2017\-5638\) which is used by botnets and thePHPUnit remote code execution (CVE\-2017\-9841\), still used to exploit vulnerableWordPress plugins. Information collected by the CPIRT (Check Point IncidentResponse Team) shows the proportion of newly reported vulnerabilities insuccessful attacks is even higher, with the ProxyShell vulnerabilities aloneused in 17% of investigated cases. This demonstrates that while 4\-5 year oldvulnerabilities exploitation attempts are widespread, successful attacks moreoften rely on newly discovered flaws, exploited before patched. The long tailphenomenon of vulnerability exploitation persists, with 50% of attacks in thewild targeting vulnerabilities reported before 2017\. These are mostly less effectiveand used by less advanced attackers. These findings once again highlight theimportance of timely system patching.6767CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023VULNERABILITYC HAPTE R6INCIDENT

Robert, thecompanys CISO, was on the line. Thus began a typical workday in the lifeof an IR analyst, which is often one of the worst days of the customers(professional) life.Unlike the analysis and trends discussed in previous chapters of this report, whichare based on Check Point products anonymized data collected during routinepreventative protection, this chapter offers the perspective of the Check PointIncident Response Team who provide attack mitigation services in response tovarious types of active breaches, and not specific to Check Point customers.Robert reported that most of their data center servers, including theDomain Controllers and File Servers, had been encrypted and renderednon\-functional. With no backups, their entire operation came to a haltand they were in need of assistance to investigate and mitigate this attack.CPIRTs mission was to look for ongoing vulnerabilities and maliciousactivity, resume network functionality, and perform root cause analysisto identify the initial attack vector and prevent future attacks.6969CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R6CPIRT involvement usually follows the discovery of visible malicious activity,such as encrypted files (ransomware), detection of spoofed or forged emails(email compromise), or the presence of malware files or unknown processes ona computer system.

The threat breakdown above is different from whatwe see in our product data, which places multipurpose malwareand infostealers at the top of the threat list. However, CPIRT datashows that the biggest risks that are visible from a large corporateperspectiveare full\-blown ransomware attacks and full networkcompromises.

The serverhad not been patched and was vulnerable to two very popular exploits usedby threat actors since 2021: the same group of vulnerabilities usedby Hafnium (CVE\-2021\-26855 and CVE\-2021\-26855, CVE\-2021\-26857 orCVE\-2021\-26858\) and the ProxyShell vulnerabilities (CVE\-2021\-34473,CVE\-2021\-34523, CVE\-2021\-31207\).In almost half of CPIRT cases, the initial foothold is achieved by exploiting avulnerable server with an unpatched RCE vulnerability and open ports to theinternet. In fact, ProxyShell vulnerabilities specifically were the cause of onein every six incidents CPIRT investigated in 2022, despite those vulnerabilitiesbeing disclosed and patched in 2021\.RCE vulnerabilityExposed RDP ServicePhishing Malspam47%24%21%Brute force Credential stuffingInsider threat8%7%Compromised Credentials3%Figure 35: Breakdown of the initial entry vector in CPIRT cases in 2022010203040507171CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R6An exposed RDP service is often used by attackers in combination with anRCE vulnerability or password attacks such as brute force or credential stuffingattack to gain a foothold in the network. Mail servers are often the weak link ina network and are a common initial entry point for attackers and more easilyencrypted. That is because, due to performance considerations, endpointsecurity and anti\-ransomware products are frequently not installed on servers.Combined with the high number of vulnerabilities, network exposure and poorpatch management, in many organizations, its the servers and not the peripheralendpoints that are the weakest point and are therefore exploited in many attacks.Further analysis revealed that the same vulnerable Exchange server hadbeen exploited twice, in incidents nine months apart. The first exploitationof the server occurred in June 2021\. Initially, only a cryptominer wasinstalled, utilizing multiple assets across the network.This emphasizes the need to treat every breach as seriously as a full\-blownransomware attack. As in this case, cryptominers and other minor malwaretypes are often initial indicators of possible exploitation that could lead tocyber disasters later on.Persistence in this attack was achieved by changing a registry key toperiodically connect and download an external resource. Initially, thiswas a cryptominer installed on dozens of machines, but the resourcecould easily have been changed to another payload. By the end of theinitial attack in mid\-2021, the attackers leaked a list of network assets inthe network, and used Mimikatz to harvest credentials from the infectednetwork. Some of the harvested passwords were NTLM hashes which,due to the practice of simple passwords, were easily reverse\-engineeredto the plain text version.7272CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R6CPIRT case statistics reveal extensive utilization by attackers of non\-signaturetools. The top tools used this year were Cobalt Strike and Mimikatz. However,for the first time, the third most popular tool in this list, AnyDesk, is a legitimateadmin tool. As threat actors have started using more legitimate admin tools intheir attacks, the use of customized malware built by the same threat actorshas declined, and we are seeing an increase in attacks that might not includeany malware at all.

RANSOMWARE ATTACKSThere are several actions that a company can take to minimize their exposure toand the potential impacts of a ransomware attack.1\. Robust Data BackupThe goal of ransomware is to force the victim to pay a ransom in order to regainaccess to their encrypted data. However, this is only effective if the targetactually loses access to their data. A robust, secure data backup solution is aneffective way to mitigate the impact of a ransomware attack. If systems arebacked up regularly, then the data lost to a ransomware attack should be minimalor non\-existent. However, it is important to ensure that the data backup solutioncannot be encrypted as well. Data should be stored in a read\-only format toprevent the spread of ransomware to drives containing recovery data.2\. Cyber Awareness TrainingPhishing emails are one of the most popular ways to spread ransom malware.By tricking a user into clicking on a link or opening a malicious attachment,cybercriminals can gain access to the employees computer and begin the processof installing and executing the ransomware program on it. With the global gapin cybersecurity talent impacting organisations around the world, frequentcybersecurity awareness training is crucial to protecting the organization againstransomware, leveraging their own staff as the first line of defence in ensuring aprotected environment. This training should instruct employees to do the following:Not click on malicious linksNever open unexpected or untrusted attachmentsAvoid revealing personal or sensitive data to phishersVerify software legitimacy before downloading itNever plug an unknown USB into their computerUse a VPN when connecting via untrusted or public Wi\-Fi8787CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R83\. Up\-to\-Date PatchesWannaCry, one of the most famous ransomware variants in existence, is anexample of a ransomware worm. Rather than relying upon phishing emails orRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain access to target systems, WannaCryspread itself by exploiting a vulnerability in the Windows Server Message Block(SMB) protocol. At the time of the famous WannaCry attack in May 2017, a patchexisted for the EternalBlue vulnerability used by WannaCry. This patch wasavailable a month before the attack and labeled as critical due to its highpotential for exploitation. However, many organizations and individuals did notapply the patch in time, resulting in a ransomware outbreak that infected 200,000computers within three days. Keeping computers up\-to\-date and applying securitypatches, especially those labeled as critical, can help to limit an organizationsvulnerability to ransomware attacks as such patches are usually overlooked ordelayed too long to offer the required protection.4\. Strengthening User AuthenticationCybercriminals commonly use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and similartools to gain remote access to an organizations systems using guessed or stolenlogin credentials. Once inside, the attacker can drop ransomware on the machineand execute it, encrypting the files stored there. This potential attack vectorcan be closed through the use of strong user authentication. Enforcing a strongpassword policy, requiring the use of multi\-factor authentication, and educatingemployees about phishing attacks designed to steal login credentials are allcritical components of an organizations cybersecurity strategy.5\. Anti\-Ransomware SolutionsWhile the previous ransomware prevention steps can help to mitigate anorganizations exposure to ransomware threats, they do not provide perfectprotection. Some ransomware operators use well\-researched and highlytargeted spear phishing emails as their attack vector. These emails may trickeven the most diligent employee, resulting in ransomware gaining access to anorganizations internal systems. Protecting against this ransomware that slipsthrough the cracks requires a specialized security solution. To achieve itsobjective, ransomware must perform certain anomalous actions, such as opening8888CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R8and encrypting large numbers of files. Anti\-ransomware solutions monitorprograms running on a computer for suspicious behaviors commonly exhibited byransomware, and if these behaviors are detected, the program can take action tostop encryption before further damage can be done.6\. Utilize better threat preventionMost ransomware attacks can be detected and resolved before it is too late.You need to have automated threat detection and prevention in place in yourorganization to maximize your chances of protection.Scan and monitor emails. Emails are a common choice of cybercriminalsexecuting phishing schemes, so take the time to scan and monitor emailson an ongoing basis, and consider deploying an automated email securitysolution to block malicious emails from ever reaching users.Scan and monitor file activity. It is also a good idea to scan and monitor fileactivity. You should be notified whenever there is a suspicious file in playbefore it becomes a threat.8989CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023ATTACKSC HAPTE R8HOW TO PREVENT
PHISHING ATTACKS1\. Always note the language in the emailSocial engineering techniques are designed to take advantage of human nature.This includes the fact that people are more likely to make mistakes when they arein a hurry and are inclined to follow the orders of people in positions of authority.Phishing attacks commonly use these techniques to convince their targets toignore their potential suspicions about an email and click on a link or open anattachment. Some common phishing techniques include:Fake OrderDelivery: A phishing email will impersonate a trusted brand(Amazon, FedEx, etc.) stating that you have made an order or have an incomingdelivery. When you click to cancel the unauthorized order or delivery, thewebsite (which belongs to a cybercriminal) will require authentication,enabling the attacker to steal login credentials.Business Email Compromise (BEC): BEC scams take advantage of hierarchyand authority within a company. An attacker will impersonate the CEO orother high\-level executive and order the recipient of the email to take someaction, such as sending money to a certain bank account (that belongs tothe scammer).Fake Invoice: The phisher will pretend to be a legitimate vendor requestingpayment of an outstanding invoice. The end goal of this scam is to havemoney transferred to the attackers account or to deliver malware via amalicious document.9090CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R82\. Never share your credentialsCredential theft is a common goal of cyberattacks. Many people reuse the sameusernames and passwords across many different accounts, so stealing thecredentials for a single account is likely to give an attacker access to a numberof the users online accounts.As a result, phishing attacks are designed to steal login credentials in variousways, such as:Phishing Sites: Attackers will create lookalike sites that require userauthentication and point to these sites in their phishing emails. Beware of linksthat dont go where you expect them to.Credential\-Stealing Malware: Not all attacks against your credentials aredirect. Some phishing emails carry malware, such as keyloggers or trojans,that are designed to eavesdrop when you type passwords into your computer.Support Scams: Cybercriminals may pose as customer support specialistsfrom Microsoft, Apple, and similar companies and ask for your logincredentials while they help you with your computer.3\. Always be suspicious of password reset emailsPassword reset emails are designed to help when you cant recall the passwordfor your account. By clicking on a link, you can reset the password to that accountto something new. Not knowing your password is, of course, also the problemthat cybercriminals face when trying to gain access to your online accounts.By sending a fake password reset email that directs you to a lookalike phishingsite, they can convince you to type in your account credentials and send those tothem. If you receive an unsolicited password reset email, always visit the websitedirectly (dont click on embedded links) and change your password to somethingdifferent on that site (and any other sites with the same password).9191CHECK POINT SOFTWARE\|SECURITY REPORT 2023C HAPTE R84\. Educate Employees About Current Phishing ThreatsPhishing attacks use human nature to trick people into doing something that theattacker wants. Common techniques include creating a sense of urgency andoffering the recipient of the email something that they desire, which increases theprobability that the target will take action without properly validating the email.Phishers will often take advantage of current events or impersonate trustedbrands in their emails to make them more realistic. By offering information,goods, or opportunities related to a current event or creating a situation wherethe recipient believes that something has gone wrong (like a fake package deliverynotification), these emails increase their probability of getting clicks.Phishing techniques and the pretexts used by cybercriminals to make their attacksseem realistic change regularly. Employees should be trained on current phishingtrends to increase the probability that they can identify and properly respond tophishing attacks.5\. Deploy an Automated Anti\-Phishing SolutionDespite an organizations best efforts, employee cybersecurity education will notprovide perfect protection against phishing attacks. These attacks are growingincreasingly sophisticated and can even trick cybersecurity experts in some cases.While phishing education can help to reduce the number of successful phishingattacks against the organization, some emails are likely to sneak through.Minimizing the risk of phishing attacks to the organization requires AI\-basedanti\-phishing software capable of identifying and blocking phishing content across allof the organizations communication services (email, productivity applications, etc.)and platforms (employee workstations, mobile devices, etc.).

Protecting against them requires solutions that can translate thisintelligence into actions that prevent the attack from succeeding.Check Point has developed over sixty threat prevention engines that leverageThreatClouds threat intelligence for zero day prevention. Some key threatprevention capabilities include:CPU Level Inspection: Cyberattackers commonly use return orientedprogramming (ROP) to bypass defenses built into CPUs. CPU level inspectionidentifies attempts to overcome executable space protection and code signing,blocking the attack before malicious code can be downloaded and executed.Threat Emulation and Extraction: Analysis of suspicious content within asandboxed environment can help to detect malware before it is delivered to atarget system. This enables the malware to be blocked or malicious content tobe excised from a document before delivery.Malware DNA Analysis: Malware authors commonly build on, borrow from,and tweak their existing code to develop new attack campaigns. This meansthat novel exploits often include behavior and code from previous campaigns,which can be used to detect the newest variation of the attack.Anti\-Bot and Anti\-Exploit: Modern cyberattacks often rely heavily uponcompromised machines being used as part of a botnet. After identifying acompromised machine, an organization can isolate it and block bot\-relatedtraffic to stop the spread of the malware.Campaign Hunting: Malware is reliant upon the attackers backendinfrastructure for command and control.

Known threats such as ransomware will continue to evolve,and new vulnerabilities will be exploited, especially given the huge leapsmade in generative AI, making it easier for malicious actors to craftattacks, leading to newer strains of cyberattack modes and breaches.Governments worldwide will tighten up regulations around cybercrimeto protect their citizens, and organizations will have to consolidateand automate their IT and security infrastructure to plug the cyber skillsgap, which is set to grow even wider this year.While we are seeing a rise in cyberattacks overall, given the growthof 5th Generation cyberattacks in the last year, the maturing of cyberdefense solutions today means that organisations and the wider societycan adopt prevention\-first solutions to block threats from ever reachingus. Businesses and governments are addressing todays sophisticatedthreats and increasing investment in their security strategies, whichbodes well as the world faces even greater challenges, with theupcoming recession and expected evolution of new malicious softwareand nefarious practices.
