Ransomware Problem0203Executive Summaryand Key FindingsAccurately assessing the scale of the ransomware problem ischallenging. Leak sites only touch on a fraction of the problem andnot all ransomware groups operate leak sites. New ransomwarevariants launch regularly. Without a leak site, it is very difficult todisclosure.The Business of Cybercrimejudge how active they are.Is Boomtime Back?The primary purpose of leak sites is to encourage currentlyrecalcitrant victims to pay. Therefore, they only show the namesof victims who are yet to pay a ransom. As such, they cannot beconsidered an accurate record of any specific group's activity.Nor are they an indication of the overall impact of ransomware.Historic data from ransomware group takedowns or collapsesindicate that leak sites only reveal a small percentage of overallattacks. For example, Hive's leak site listed 150 organizations, likelyaccounting for around 10 percent of their overall victim count of1,500\. Avaddon listed just 180 victims, a small fraction of the nearly3,000 decryption keys the group released when it shuttered theoperation. It is difficult to assess how representative theseexamples are.Innovations in TTPs Occur04When Infection Chains AreForced to Evolve0506State\-SponsoredThreat ActivityThreat Actor Use ofArtificial Intelligence07Conclusion08AppendixTo extrapolate, we would need to know how successful each group'sleak site is and what the likelihood of payment by a victim once theyhave been named is. It may not be outlandish to assume that thevast majority of successful ransomware operations occur withoutthe victim's name ever reaching the leak sitethat is where theincentive to pay lies, with the victim motivated to prevent publicLeak sites generally do not reveal whether ransomware was deployed.And we can't draw conclusions about how effective or impactfula ransomware deployment was, and whether the victim did notpay because the impact was low, or because the data stolen wasinconsequential.Name\-and\-shame statistics are useful for some things. They showhow particular variants emerge onto the scene and how theygrow and shrink in usage. But how reliable are they as indicators ofimpact? Without knowing how many victims pay the ransom, wecan't determine how successful any particularly variant is in terms ofpayment to victim ratio. Leak site data should therefore be used withcaution. In aggregate though it is clear from the continued activitythat ransomware and data\-theft extortion remain a viable criminalbusiness model and a substantial threat to businesses.2023 State of the Threat: A Year in Review1101Letter From Our VPDwell Times Are Dropping for

Limiting how employees access company resources frompersonally owned devices can greatly reduce the enterprise's riskfrom infostealers.Over the past year, Russian Market also added a pre\-order functionto its website, enabling buyers to request logs by domain or type.

Their developers rely on positivefeedback for success and not all will become widely used.Although the use of these tools to harvest credentials is clearlywidespread, firm evidence connecting specific stealers to specificcompromises is scant. This is likely to be down to two key factors:one, if credentials are used in a compromise, their origin is rarelymade clear and two, the time delay between them being collectedby an infostealer and used in an intrusion is likely to be significant,and certainly well beyond the scope of most incident responseengagements.Figure 8\.

Patching PaysScan\-and\-exploit, where threat actors use search engines likeShodan to identify vulnerable systems, can lead to spikes in attackactivity by specific groups, and even anomalistic peaks in name\-and\-shame ransomware activity.

In August 2022,Secureworks incident responders worked on an engagementwhere the group likely exploited a Log4j vulnerability (CVE\-2021\-4104\) to compromise an organization's internet\-facing FlexeraFlexNet server.Chinese ransomware group6 BRONZE STARLIGHT also uses scan\-and\-exploit attacks to target unpatched internet\-facing servers.For example, in August 2022, CTU researchers observed BRONZESTARLIGHT compromising an organization's vulnerable internet\-facing ManageEngine server. Other state\-sponsored groups dependon scan\-and\-exploit too, for example China's BRONZE ATLAS andIran's COBALT MIRAGE.The easy availability of information about vulnerable servers caneven see multiple threat actors compromising a network using thesame vulnerability, at the same time or in quick succession.The annual listing of top routinely exploited vulnerabilities publishedby CISA and partner agencies lists top vulnerabilities that threatactors scan for. Frequently, this list contains older vulnerabilities.Of the top 12 vulnerabilities exploited during 2022 listed in theroundup7 for the year, seven have CVE dates of earlier than 2022\.One, CVE\-2018\-13379, a path traversal vulnerability in FortinetFortiOS and FortiProxy, also made the top 15 routinely exploited listin 2021 and in 2020\.While organizations should always prioritize their patching scheduleaccording to their individual risk profile, the vulnerabilities listed inthese reports likely remain at high risk of exploitation.01Letter From Our VP0203Executive Summaryand Key FindingsThe Business of CybercrimeIs Boomtime Back?Innovations in TTPs Occur04When Infection Chains AreForced to Evolve0506State\-SponsoredThreat ActivityThreat Actor Use ofArtificial Intelligence07Conclusion08Appendix2023 State of the Threat: A Year in Review1901Letter From Our VP0203Executive Summaryand Key FindingsThe Business of CybercrimeIs Boomtime Back?Innovations in TTPs Occur04When Infection Chains AreForced to EvolveData Leak\-Only AttacksWhat's

Itslisted victims, while the data theft\-only operation features theremainder. And the bulk of those are from two campaigns from2023\.

It is not possible to gaugeexactly how many were affected given that the victims named onleak sites constitute those who have not paid the ransom.Such activity for a ransomware group is unusual, but it forms themost recent chapter in its exploitation of vulnerabilities to stealand ransom victim data. Since late 2020, the group has sought toexploit both zero\-day and N\-day vulnerabilities in file managementapplications to extort the users of such services. Their use of zero\-day vulnerabilities is notable, and shows how well\-resourced thegroup iszero\-days are expensive to develop or procure, and werehistorically the domain of state\-sponsored actors.members have worked with GOLD DRAKE (EvilCorp, Dridex), GOLDBLACKBURN (TrickBot), GOLD NIAGARA (FIN7\), and other well\-known threat groups.

The revelationsin the Conti Leaksa large disclosure of information about thegroup's activity, likely by a Ukrainian affiliate angered at the group'salmost immediate declaration of support for Russia's invasionpreceded the disappearance of Conti ransomware by a few months.While the full reasons for its dissolution remain unclear, it is likelythat affiliates were concerned about damage to the Conti name thatmight make it harder for victims to pay. GOLD ULRICK may also havebeen disconcerted by the U.S. Department of State announcing9in May 2022 a $10 million reward for information leading to theidentification or location of key leaders behind the Conti ransomwareoperation. Such unwanted scrutiny may have also been a cause forthe group's disappearance.However, that did not mean that group members remained absentfrom the ransomware ecosystem for long.

In January 2023,an international operation24, led by the FBI in coordination withDutch and German law enforcement agencies, targeted theinfrastructure associated with the Hive ransomware\-as\-a\-service(RaaS), operated by GOLD HAWTHORNE. Websites and serversthat members of the group used to communicate with each otherwere seized, resulting in a disruption that led to the apparentdemise of Hive. Since July 2022, the FBI had allegedly gainedaccess to the group's network, seized decryption keys, and issuedthem to victims of the ransomware\-as\-a\-service (RaaS) scheme.This activity clearly denied the individuals behind the schemecriminal profits while easing the pain of its many victims.2023 State of the Threat: A Year in Review2901Letter From Our VPTrickBot Members Sanctioned0203Executive Summaryand Key FindingsThe Business of CybercrimeIs Boomtime Back?In the case of TrickBot, people rather than infrastructure weretargeted.

The group,which we track as GOLD BLACKBURN, was heavily embedded withthe operators of the now defunct Conti ransomware scheme, anespecially prolific and sophisticated criminal enterprise operated byInnovations in TTPs OccurGOLD ULRICK.

It followsOFAC placing its first sanction on a virtual currency mixer in May2022, due, on that occasion, to the mixer's involvement in facilitatingmoney laundering for the North Korean regime.Law enforcement agencies have long come up against issues ofjurisdiction, which not only impede the ability to identify specificindividuals involved in a cybercriminal operation, but also shield themfrom arrest. These latest attempts at disruption versus prosecutionare a possible attempt to address that. If you can't prosecute threatactors, you can at least frustrate their activities and hamper theirability to make and spend money, travel internationally, or leaveRussia at all.Romcom RAT Blurs the LinesThe war in Ukraine has not permanently damaged the 
cybercriminal landscape as originally hoped but third\-party 
researchers and the media have asked questions25 about 
whether it has blurred the lines between cybercrime and 
nation\-state activity. GOLD FLAMINGO, operators of the 
Cuba ransomware, has been accused of performing espionage 
activities alongside moneymaking.The group was reported26 in August 2022 to have deployed 
the RomCom RAT alongside Cuba ransomware in an intrusion. 
CERT\-UA subsequently saw RomCom RAT used against 
government and military targets in Ukraine27\.Figure 12\. GOLD FLAMINGO's Cuba ransomware leak site, which at the 
time of publication had posted its most recent victim on July 11, 2023\. 
(Source: Secureworks)The number of named Cuba ransomware victims dropped off 
throughout the year following the invasion of Ukraine. After a 
brief surge in late 2022, no victims were named at all for the 
first four months of 2023\. It is possible that the group has 
instead been actively engaged in undertaking operations on 
behalf of the Russian State, but it is also feasible they do not 
have exclusive use of the RomCom RAT, and another group 
has conducted those operations. It does not appear that Cuba 
ransomware itself has been deployed against these Ukrainian 
targets, and there is still no smoking gun evidence about 
routine collusion between ransomware groups and Russian 
intelligence operations.2023 State of the Threat: A Year in Review3001Letter From Our VPChinese Cybercrime Activity0203Executive Summaryand Key FindingsThe Business of CybercrimeIs Boomtime Back?Innovations in TTPs Occur04When Infection Chains AreA very high proportion of the ransomware activity that CTUresearchers observe emanates from cybercriminals based in eitherRussia or its CIS neighbors. However, there are exceptions. Overthe past year, we have observed cybercriminal attacks conductedby financially motivated threat groups that are likely Chinese. Onegroup is particularly noteworthy: GOLD FIESTA.CTU analysis of GOLD FIESTA intrusion activity, which wasobserved during several incident response engagements that tookplace in February 2023, identified clear overlap with Hello, Cring,and Rapture ransomware precursor activity.

It would beunsurprising for groups to prefer tools and techniques covered inopen\-source research written in their native language.

a Persistent ProblemBusiness email compromise (BEC) is one of the most financiallydamaging online crimes overall for organizations. It exceeds evenransomware in aggregate, mainly because it is so prolific, even ifindividual financial losses from BEC may be lower than individuallosses from ransomware. The FBI estimates33 that in 2022 alone, itreceived complaints about 21,832 BEC attacks, resulting in adjustedlosses in the U.S. of over $2\.7 billion USD, an increase from $2\.4billion USD in 2021\. In contrast, the FBI received 2,385 complaintsabout ransomware attacks in the U.S. in 2022 that resulted inestimates for adjusted losses of approximately $34\.3 million.However, individuals and organizations may be more motivatedto report BEC than ransomware attacks to the FBI which couldsomewhat skew these figures.Most BEC incidents involve a threat actor intercepting an email chainand impersonating one of the participants to convince the victim tomodify details of a legitimate payment to redirect it to an attacker\-controlled bank account rather than the intended recipient.Threat actors use a range of techniques including mass phishingcampaigns to steal credentials which are then used to access thevictim email account. Once they have access, they often monitorthe activity of the email account, identifying email chains withvendors and suppliers in which they can insert themselves. After theattacker has successfully initiated communication with the victim,they provide modified legitimate financial documents or paymentinstructions for the victim to send money to the attacker\-controlledaccounts. Attackers may also spoof victim organizations to requestpayment without first compromising a victim's email account. Thisvariation is referred to as Business Email Spoofing or CEO fraud.Over the course of the year, CTU researchers have observed threatactors employing a range of different methods to capture credentialsand facilitate BEC fraud. These have included the use of offlineHTML login pages to circumvent detections that look for maliciousexecutables or documents that auto\-forward users to fake loginpages. Threat actors have also been observed employing a varietyof tactics to bypass multi\-factor authentication (MFA) includingsocial engineering to convince a victim to approve an authenticationrequest and, less frequently, MFA fatigue attacks which send manyauthorization requests in quick succession. Once a victim approves amalicious MFA request, the threat actor can add their own device toa list of approved devices to maintain persistence.01Letter From Our VP0203Executive Summaryand Key FindingsThe Business of CybercrimeIs Boomtime Back?Innovations in TTPs Occur04When Infection Chains AreForced to Evolve0506State\-SponsoredThreat ActivityThreat Actor Use ofArtificial Intelligence07Conclusion08Appendix2023 State of the Threat: A Year in Review34In one compromise analyzed by Secureworks incident responders,Organizations can mitigate BEC attacks by comprehensivelya threat actor gained access because an employee approvedimplementing MFA across all user accounts, including those fora malicious MFA request and did not report the incident.

(Source: Secureworks)Many techniques have remained the same, including the use ofZIP archives to encapsulate delivered files. Less common formatssuch as RAR and ACE are seen on occasion but suffer fromWindows' inability to open these files without third\-party utilitiesinstalled. Similarly, active content such as executable, script files,and shortcut links remain popular. JavaScript, VBS, and Windowsbatch files are the most commonly observed script types observedin attacks. In one phishing campaign to deliver the Remcos RATthat CTU researchers observed in May 2023, emails included ZIParchive attachments that contained PDF files. Clicking on the PDFtook victims first to a gateway page that performed checks on thevictim's system and then to a prompt to download an obfuscatedVBS file from the MEGA cloud file\-sharing site.Threat actors have also increasingly turned to the use of maliciousMicrosoft OneNote files to deliver payloads such as the RedLineinformation stealer, Qakbot, or IcedID. CTU researchers observedtwo infection chains used by unknown threat actors from January12 to January 18, 2023, to deliver RedLine. In both cases, thevictim received a OneNote file attachment. Opening it revealeda blurred image which recipients were invited to click. This imagewas underlaid with multiple copies of a malicious script. Executingthe script generated a pop\-up warning. If the victim dismissed thewarning, the script launched a BAT file, copied a PowerShell binary toa new location, and executed a PowerShell command that decrypted,decompressed, and executed the RedLine payload.Threat actors evolved their use of OneNote files over the followingmonths to avoid detection. In a campaign that delivered Qakbot, theOneNote attachment contained an embedded HTML Application(HTA) file (Open.hta) that downloaded and executed the Qakbotpayload. In further campaigns to deliver IcedID, a threat actor useda similar approach to the Qakbot campaign, leveraging modifiedHTA code to launch obfuscated VBScript code that launched aPowerShell command to download and execute the payload. CTUresearchers have investigated several intrusions that ultimately led toBlack Basta ransomware deployment where OneNote files were usedto deliver Qakbot.2023 State of the Threat: A Year in Review3801Letter From Our VP0203Executive Summaryand Key FindingsThe Business of CybercrimeIs Boomtime Back?Innovations in TTPs Occur04When Infection Chains AreForced to Evolve0506State\-SponsoredThreat ActivityThreat Actor Use ofArtificial Intelligence07ConclusionBotnetsSome Flourish,
Others DeclineThe past year saw the continued decline of the large\-scale, long\-lived botnets favored by cybercriminals for the past decade and ahalf. The Conti leaks fallout of March 2022 expedited the downfall ofboth the TrickBot and Bazar botnets, previously operated by GOLDBLACKBURN. The last year also saw GOLD CRESTWOOD's prolificEmotet botnet, whose association with the Conti ransomwareoperation was revealed in the Conti leaks, largely sidelined by itsoperators for unknown reasons, despite several signals that theyintended to return it to its former prevalence. For example, inOctober GOLD CRESTWOOD implemented functionality in theirEmotet malware that was likely intended to identify researchersystems and malware sandboxes. However, on November 11, it tooka four\-month hiatus, only returning for a brief burst of spamming inMarch that lasted until early April.At the end of August 2023, we also saw the demise of GOLDLAGOONs Qakbot. Thanks to the concerted international lawenforcement Operation Duck Hunt36, led by the FBI, the botnetwas rendered inoperable. At 23:27 UTC on August 25, we observedthe successful takedown through our botnet emulator, detectingthe Qakbot botnet distributing shellcode to infected devices. Theshellcode unpacked a custom DLL (dynamic link library) executablecontaining code that cleanly terminates the running Qakbot processAt approximately the same time as the DLL began neutralizinginfections, CTU researchers observed GOLD LAGOON's backendinfrastructure had stopped responding and some infrastructure hadbeen replaced. To interact with infected hosts, the replacementservers required a certificate that can sign messages. Such effortswill make it very hard for GOLD LAGOON to reimplement Qakbot.Qakbot posed a significant threat to businesses globally. Engineeredfor eCrime, Qakbot infections led to the deployment of some ofthe most sophisticated and damaging ransomware variants. Theseincluded Conti, ProLock, Egregor, REvil, MegaCortex, and, morerecently, Black Basta, and collectively resulted in losses to businessesin the hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. The takedown is awelcome intervention.By contrast, the IcedID botnet flourished in the past year, having longdispensed with its original purpose of facilitating banking fraud toinstead provide initial access to a variety of ransomware\-distributingthreat groups. IcedID is used to deliver additional malware which canlead to ransomware deployment; its operator, GOLD SWATHMORE,functions as an initial access broker (IAB), selling access tocompromised systems to numerous ransomware operators.

the War from the SidelinesPrior to 2022, BRONZE PRESIDENT focused its efforts on Asia,mainly Myanmar and Vietnam. However, since Russia's invasion ofUkraine on February 24, 2022, its focus has shifted to obtainingpolitical intelligence surrounding the ongoing war. The threat groupconsistently employs decoy documents that relate to political issuesin the countries surrounding Ukraine, as well as Europe more widely,whilst targeting government officials and various national foreignministries.Since the invasion, CTU researchers observed multiple examplesof BRONZE PRESIDENT's use of PlugX malware to collect relevantinformation. During 2022, the group used malicious shortcut (LNK)files to deliver their malware and continued to use DLL side\-loading.However, techniques varied.For example, analysis of the LNK files used in JuneJuly 2022 andOctober 2022 campaigns showed the LNK file pointing to a copyof the legitimate Adobe Acrobat Distiller executable file, whichwas renamed and used to sideload a highly obfuscated DLL loader.The file imported a highly obfuscated malicious DLL, which thenloaded an encrypted payload file. However, the malware authorchose different (and in each case quite novel) functions to abusefor the shellcode loading, suggesting that the group continuouslyexperiments with different approaches to evasion of host\-basedsecurity agents.Figure 26\.
