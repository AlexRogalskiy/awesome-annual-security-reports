Security 2023:
Quick Reaction Force
Cyberattacks continue to grow in quantity and sophistication at 
the same time that organizations systems become increasingly 
complex. Security teams, as always, feel the stress. But a surprising 
outcome of our 2023 State of Security research is that the number of 
respondents who say they just cant keep up has shrunk.
Dont plan a victory parade just yet; 53% of respondents worldwide 
tell us that keeping up with security requirements is harder than it 
was two years ago, and thats still a lot. But the number in 2022 was 
66%. Our own security experts, able to spot the dark lining in every 
silver cloud, note that 2022 didnt have as many novel developments 
to throw security teams into disarray; no SolarWinds, no Log4J. No 
iceberg for your organizational Titanic, to quote them directly.
Whether this data represents incremental improvement or a one\-
time windfall, organizations should press any advantage. Which wont 
be easy: Most security teams tell us theyre too stuck in reactive 
mode to be effectively proactive.

leaders who spend half or more of their time 
on security issues.

Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
Drilling down, we asked the slim majority who say their job 
has gotten harder to tell us whats making it harder. This 
subsets top challenges:The increasing sophistication of threats (according to 38%, 
ranking it No. 1 for the third straight year)Security stack complexity (according to 30%)IaaS and SaaS driving challenges in risk monitoring and 
management (29% and 28%, respectively)Workload demands trapping teams in react mode (28%) 
That last bullet is further reflected in several trailing 
responses. Respondents tell us that they are overwhelmed 
by the number of attacks (24%) and false positives (25%). 
Another 25% each say they struggle to hire or retain 
enough skilled staffers.
There are global variations in terms of struggle. 
Organizations in the Asia\-Pacific region are five to seven 
percentage points more likely than the global average 
to say that its hard to monitor SaaS applications and to 
effectively analyze all security data. European respondents 
are less likely to voice that complaint, while North 
American orgs hewed to the worldwide average.
We see 
tremendous 
challenges 
Some of the most noteworthy 
stats youll read in this years 
report include:64% of SOC teams struggle to pivot from one security 
tool to the next, with little integration to make it easier.88% of respondents report talent challenges, 
whether key, high\-level skills or just hiring enough bodies.Bad guys get in. And when they do, their average
dwell time is 2\.24 months, or about nine long weeks.
We also see efforts to address
the countless challenges.
High points include:95% of organizations have increased their focus
on third\-party risk assessment.81% of orgs are converging aspects of security and
IT operations.95% of security budgets will increase over the
next two years 56% of them significantly.

Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
We found that across industries and geography, security 
leaders and their peers throughout the organization are 
increasingly collaborating to improve resilience. Classic 
cybersecurity is concerned with proactive prevention of 
incidents, while resilience is reactive: Its about what you do 
once an incident occurs.
But preparing your organization to most efficiently recover 
from a crisis is very much a proactive undertaking. Risk 
assessment, incident response planning and key investments 
in technology and training, and more these require 
strategic thinking beyond the strict confines of cybersecurity. 
Our respondents tell us that security teams are finding more 
success at partnering across the organization, being seen 
as valuable partners enablers rather than the Dept. of 
No\-Can\-Do. As well cover below, 79% of line\-of\-business 
stakeholders see the security team as valued partners, 
rewarding those teams with a seat at the collaborative table 
and better funding.
And the business leaders to set the budget for security are 
increasingly looking at metrics that measure resilience, 
starting with mean time to recover. In fact, MTTR tops the list.

Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
Across the board, whether they say that theyre overwhelmed 
or not, respondents identified a diffuse range of challenges. 
While no one type of crisis dominated, the generalized 
problem of spending too much time tackling emergencies 
pulled into a comfortable first place.
There are a number of causes for this perpetual reactive 
mode and, frankly, not a lot of solutions. Organizations 
experience cyberattacks by the thousands, so a reactive 
stance is inevitable. While smart security teams do their best 
to get ahead of known attack vectors, there are always new 
techniques that send you scrambling again. 
Additionally, compliance just doesnt get easier. The 
increasing sophistication of technology, of the ways in 
which data is used, and the methods of attack all mean that 
regulatory standards will (eventually) rise as well. 
55% of respondents expect that 
hiring and retention would be harder in 
a recession.
32% think that hiring and retention 
would get easier.
As economies tip toward 
recession, staffing challenges 
are expected to get even 
more acute.

The state of the SOC
As the previous pages indicate, security teams are strained. 
Todays security operations center has a lot to cover, and not 
enough people to cover it.64% of SOC teams complain about pivoting
among too many disparate security tools and 
management consoles, with little (if any) integration, 
inhibiting comprehensive and timely investigations 
and response.49% say that they lack enough staff to manually 
triage, investigate and respond to an increasing 
volume of security events.
The result: increased risk resulting from their workload. On 
average, respondents estimate that 41% of alerts that would 
be beneficial to investigate are ignored due to a lack of 
available SOC bandwidth. And of course, the alerts you dont 
investigate could include a true positive, allowing an attack 
to succeed. This undermines everything: the actual return 
on your investment in the expensive tools generating these 
alerts, the efficiency and morale of your analyst team, and 
the actual security and resilience of your organization.

Impact of the talent 
crisis
The perennial labor shortage remains a serious problem: 
88% of respondents report challenges with cybersecurity 
staffingskills, including 53% who say that they cant hire 
enough staff generally (matching last years finding) and 
59% (up from 58%) who cant find talent with the right 
particular skills. 
Security leaders are turning to managed security service 
providers in high numbers (42% are increasing their use of 
MSSPs), allowing teams to both beef up off\-hours coverage 
and offload tier\-one issues around the clock. Despite this, 
the talent struggle has led to a number of issues over the 
last 12 months:81% of respondents say that members of their staff have 
been forced to take on responsibilities that they arent 
ready for up from 76% last year.81% report that critical staff member(s) left the 
organization for another job due to burnout.78% of respondents say the resulting increase in their 
workload has led them to consider looking for a new role 
 up from 70% a year ago.77% say one or more projectsinitiatives have failed 
up from 68%.
Talent is always in crisis in the cybersecurity space. But these 
numbers show not just a chronic condition, but an increasingly 
acute one. Shrugging it off as Its always like this would be a 
crucial mistake.
Highest\-Priority Tactics to 
Overcome Talent Challenges

Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
Mitigating talent 
challenges
Security leaders are taking steps to mitigate the 
challenges. As noted on the previous page, MSSPs are 
playing a bigger role: 86% of organizations have relied on 
service providers to help close skill gaps. In fact, 56% of 
respondents say the majority of security operations work 
at their organization is outsourced to a third\-party service 
provider, most often to extend security operations to be 
more continuous and to gain access to service providers 
more advanced tooling. Forty\-two percent say they plan to 
increase those engagements. 
Then theres looking for more help within ones org: 86% 
of organizations have started reskilling individuals outside 
of the security team to help fill gaps, with 38% planning to 
offload more security tasks to IT staff in the coming year.
Increased training is the No. 1 choice, besides more 
hiring, for respondents in every region. The top areas that 
security teams are under pressure to upskill include cloud 
operations and architecture (41%) and secure application 
development (42%).
Additionally, security teams are embracing automation 
and improving their tooling, and making data a focus (see 
chart), as a means of making shorthanded teams ever 
more effective.

Resilience is the main 
metric
We asked respondents to indicate the top three 
performance metrics used by business leaders to judge 
security effectiveness, and saw a significant indication of 
a resilience mindset. In the chart at right, four of the top 
six responses (all but compliance and risk mitigation) play 
directly into resilience strategies, with mean time to detect 
and recover coming out on top (34%), and downtime (30%) 
ahead of counting attacks and incidents. 
Whereas the quantity or sophistication of attacks you face 
is outside your control you dont know whos coming at 
you next you can definitely measure your MTTR. And if 
you accept that service disruptions are inevitable, then how 
quickly and effectively you deal with them really matters.
MTTR is easier to measure and improve, notes Splunk 
Distinguished Security Strategist Ryan Kovar, who leads our 
SURGe threat advisory team. You cant necessarily hone 
your MTTD, because the threats are unknown. SolarWinds 
was a novel attack, and your time to detect on that was 
two years. But you can drill for MTTR. And thats where you 
create resilience.
79% of business stakeholders 
see the security team as a partner, 
not an obstacle.

Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
Security teams have long understood their value to the 
business and that good security, and strong resilience, 
is not about saying no to every new initiative. But it has 
taken time for businesses to understand this mentality and 
embrace security as an active partner, enabling business 
success. Our survey this time shows that for most teams, 
the business side gets it.
Respondents tell us that 79% of line\-of\-business 
stakeholders see the security team as either a trusted 
source of information (49%) or a key enabler of the 
organizations mission (30%). Its a slim minority that still 
sees security as a necessary inconvenience (12%) or 
complete roadblock (8%).
The security teams role as a strategic partner and enabler 
facilitates the broader collaboration and a holistic focus 
on resilience, as well see. And at the leadership level, 
respect and a seat at the table produce tangible results. 
Respondents told us that access to business leadership 
improves the security teams ability to collaborate with other 
parts of the business (46%) and results in increased security 
team funding (42%).

Despite new strategies and better cross\-
organization partnerships, security teams face 
significant challenges. The bad guys arent slowing 
down, either. Globally, our research found more 
incidents, longer dwell times and business\-
impacting damage.

The existential impact
Security incidents are an existential threat. In addition 
to the considerable time and resources expended to 
clean up the mess, significant numbers of respondents 
say incidents had damaged their companys competitive 
position, hurt the stock price, or created a public 
embarrassment. Only 4% of respondents say they 
had suffered incidents but experienced no significant 
consequences.
In terms of attack types, note that by supply chain 
attacks (which hit 46% of respondents, globally) we 
mean actual attacks that succeeded using that vector. If 
wed measured it to mean you discovered unexploited 
vulnerabilities in third\-party software and remediated 
them in time, the number would be higher. By a lot.
Whatever the avenue, once the bad guys get in, theyve 
got time to get comfortable. On average, respondents 
tell us that its 2\.24 months, or about nine weeks, from 
the moment a bad actor penetrates their systems until 
appropriate parties are aware of it. Thats a lot of time to 
steal or break things.

Incidents, Alerts and Threat Vectors
The issue resonates at the highest level. Nearly everyone 
(91%) says their CISO is actively collaborating more with 
line\-of\-business leaders (finance, marketing, operations, 
etc.) on cyber resilience strategies and investments. But 
those CISOs have their work cut out for them:Just 31% say they have a formal approach to cyber 
resilience that has been instituted organization\-
wide across critical systems.Only 38% have a resilience strategy in place in 
pockets of the organization.31% say they have yet to implement any resilience 
strategies. 
Lack of resilience is a 
dire threat
Security teams understand that they need to improve 
resilience. Most respondents (62%, up from 54% last year) 
report that cybersecurity incidents take down business\-
critical applications at least once a month. The mean 
number of those outages is about 22 per year (up from 19\). 
Security teams say theyre working to continue to improve 
those resilience metrics. On average, they say they aim 
to reduce MTTD by 40% and MTTR by 53%. We did see 
improvement this year over last years research: The 
average mean time to recover (MTTR) for business\-critical 
workloads suffering from unplanned downtime tied to a 
cybersecurity incident is 15\.5 hours (down from 21\.4 hours). 
Still, downtime costs consume 2\.7% of annual revenue.
Controlling those costs isnt the only issue. Asked why 
theyre focusing on resilience:83% of respondents agree that their risk of 
significant business disruption is elevated.79% think a loss of productivity will put them at 
risk of being out\-innovated.78% of respondents agree that downtimes effect 
on digital experience may cost them customers.
While 91% of CISOs are 
collaborating across the business 
on resilience, fewer than a third 
have an organization\-wide 
approach to resilience in place.

Incidents, Alerts and Threat Vectors
Vector by vector
When we asked respondents to review a stressfully long list 
to pick their three most concerning potential vulnerabilities, 
the responses are fairly evenly distributed, with no dominant 
leaders. Two high\-profile attack types that deserve a deeper 
dive are the software supply chain and ransomware, while 
the ubiquity of public cloud as part of organizations attack 
surface merits its own consideration.
Supply chain. Software supply chain attacks are top\-of\-
mind in the post\-SolarWinds (and Log4j, and Kaseya, and ) 
era. Fully 95% of organizations have increased their focus 
on third\-party risk assessment activity, up from an already 
noteworthy 90% a year ago. 
Looking into the tactics involved reveals a very diffuse 
approach to supply chain security. From a list of 17 
responses to supply chain threats, the top three answers 
tied with a 26% adoption rate:Assessing security controls to understand 
preventiondetection capabilities specific to supply 
chain attacksHardening authentication systemsIncreasing security budgets
The fragmentation of responses the lack of any widely 
adopted tactic suggests a disjointed approach to a 
problem that only recently entered the spotlight.

Incidents, Alerts and Threat Vectors
Ransomware. Ransomware is like Covid\-19\. You may still 
know people who havent had it yet, but there are fewer of 
them all the time. Since the 2022 State of Security research, 
the number of organizations reporting that they had not yet 
been hit with a ransomware attack dropped from 21% to just 
13%. Similarly, while 35% of organizations in 2022 reported 
having had datasystems held hostage, this years number 
rose to 43%.
When orgs get hit, theyre likelier than ever to pay up. Last year, 
66% of organizations said that they (or their insurer) just paid 
off the attackers. This year, that number is 75%. And ransoms 
continue to rise: Last year, only 32% of respondents said their 
largest ransom had been $250,000 or more. This year, its 
50%. On average, respondents say that the largest ransom 
theyd paid attackers was $430,978, up 24% (from $346,897\) 
since last year.
(This surprised us, because other research in the past year 
has suggested ransoms are going down. Rechecking our 
numbers, we find that the most senior respondents, who 
should really know, are even more likely (79%) to say that 
theyve paid more and more often.)
As with supply chain risks, theres a wide spread in adoption 
of tactics to combat ransomware. Theres slightly more 
commonality in the approaches, though, with two tactics 
being adoptedaccelerated by 33% of respondents: 
investment in SIEM solutions and focus on email security. 
Four other tactics had a 31% adoption rate: SOAR, advanced 
analytics, multifactor authentication, and endpoint 
configuration hardening tools.
On the other hand, the lower percentage investing in air\-
gapped backuprestore capabilities (21% of respondents) 
suggests that organizations are prioritizing detection and 
response over recovery.
Data is the answer: 91% of respondents agree that better 
capture and analysis of detection data is one of the most 
effective tools to prevent successful ransomware attacks.
Must know cloud: When we asked 
about the various areas in which security 
teams are under pressure to upskill, 
cloud operations and architecture led 
cited by 41% of respondents.
The State of Security 2023\|Splunk
16
Incidents, Alerts and Threat Vectors
Cloud security. The cloud is where the action is, with 50% of 
respondents saying that the majority of their SOC teams time 
is spent addressing issues in the public cloud, while just 13% 
spend most of their time on on\-premises issues. 
This tracks, because much of our IT environments is in 
the cloud. Fifty\-three percent of respondents say that the 
majority of their business\-critical applications and workloads 
run in the cloud. Interestingly, this is down from 66% a year 
ago, but still significant. And in the public cloud, the threat is 
generally not an attack that outwits your cloud providers 
defenses. Its more likely to be a misconfiguration on your end. 
The bad guys arent looking to break down any doors; theyre 
trusting you to leave one open for them.
Respondents gave us their top three cloud security 
challenges:
1\.Maintaining security consistency across their data 
center and public cloud environments (No. 1 for the 
third year in a row, but with the percentage declining 
from 45% last year to 33% for 2023\)
2\.Keeping identity and access management (IAM) 
systems accurate and up to date (32%, and up from 
third place a year ago)
3\.Use of multiple cybersecurity controls increases
cost and complexity (28%, and slipping from No. 2
a year ago)
We then asked them what theyre doing about it. Again, 
there was a wide range of tactics with no runaway leader, 
but the most common approaches are:
1\.Identifying workload configurations that are out of 
compliance andor dont adhere to industry best 
practices (No. 1 for the third year in a row, though
the percentage declined from 39% in 2022 to 30% 
this year)
2\.The configuration of security groups (e.g externally 
facing server workloads) (25%, and up from fourth 
place a year ago)
3\.Improving audit trail understanding among privileged 
and service accounts (24%, holding steady at No. 3\)
Cloud and hybrid architectures are new, complex and ever\-
changing. Theyll continue to be an area of intense challenge.

Converging on resilience
To meet new and persistent challenges, organizations are 
focusing on resilience and agility. For the next 12 months, 
51% of respondents plan solutions or investments that 
combine cyber resilience efforts with traditional business 
continuitydisaster recovery preparation. Further, 48% will 
make investments to speed the recovery of user services, 
and 47% are planning investments that speed security 
teams response. 
Resilience is a team sport, and most respondents 
understand that converging security operations with other 
functions (e.g collaborating more closely, creating hybrid 
roles that overlay functions, etc.) holds promise:81% of organizations are converging aspects of 
security and IT operations.69% are converging aspects of security operations 
and digital experience.69% are converging aspects of security operations 
and application development.61% are converging aspects of security operations 
and observability.
Why? Respondents most often believe convergence will 
help with overall visibility of risks in their environment 
(58%) and that they will see improved cooperation in threat 
identificationresponse processes (55%).
95% of security budgets will 
increase over the next two years 
56% of them significantly.

Goals and Strategies
Budgets rise, priorities 
shift
Security teams are spending more and collaborating more 
broadly. Fully 95% of respondents expect their security 
spending to increase over the next two years, and 56% 
say spending will increase significantly (up from 51% a year 
before). 
Where funding will go to tools and technology, theres 
an even split in terms of approach: 50% say theyll focus 
on platform\-based tools with out\-of\-the\-box integration. 
The other half will emphasize a best\-of\-breed approach, 
integrating individual solutions as needed through APIs.
Strategic focuses have shifted since last year, as evident in 
the top four priorities:Developing and building an integrated software 
architecture for security analytics and operations 
tools (38% versus 21% a year ago, moving to the top 
spot from a tie for third)Purchasing security operations tools designed to 
help an organization automate and orchestrate 
security operations processes (35% versus 22% a 
year ago)Consolidating tools and personnel into an enterprise 
SOC (35%, up from 15% in 2022 to break into the top
10 responses)Developing more formal documented security 
operations processes (33%, up from 17% and
10th place)
Taken as a whole, these four leading strategies point to a 
desire to create a more effective, faster\-moving and more 
professionalized SOC.

Deployment of technologies designed for security analytics 
and operations automation and orchestration hold 
remarkably steady this year. Sixty\-seven percent report 
deploying such technologies 37% extensively. This is 
essentially unchanged from last years research, which 
found 67% adoption, with 36% doing so extensively.
Respondents say theyre using analytics across the entire 
attack lifecycle, to improve threat detection (37%), to help 
identify cyber risks (36%), to accelerate investigations (33%) 
and automate remediation (35%).
Top uses also include: to automate security processes 
based on real\-time data (33%), and to help determine which 
investigations to prioritize (also 33%).
From a task perspective, the top targets for automation are:29% prioritize integrating security tools with IT 
operations systems.27% prioritize integrating external threat intelligence 
with internal security data.27% prioritize automating basic remediation tasks 
(such as updating endpoint security controls) with 
their automation and orchestration initiatives.

Goals and Strategies
Its not all forward progress. Efforts to enrich security 
analytics with other analytics IT operations, business 
and risk management appears to be plateauing. A year 
ago, 43% of organizations reported a significant level of 
integration across these sources; today the figure has fallen 
to 39%. (Another 35%, globally, report marginal integration.) 
Theres a distinct difference among global regions, with 
45% North American respondents reporting significant 
integration, versus Europe and Asia\-Pacific trailing at 35% 
and 36%, respectively.
The best explanation for the regression would seem to 
be the complexity of data and the difficulty in integrating 
disparate tools.
Theres a lot of complexity that goes into developing good 
analytics, SURGe leader Ryan Kovar notes. The pandemic 
drove a lot of change and an explosion of new data sources. 
Just as orgs might have been getting a handle on that kind 
of analytics integration, theyve got all this new data and are 
having to refactor everything.
That said, vendors (including yours truly) are always looking 
to create more out\-of\-the\-box ways to reduce complexity, 
helping organizations overcome any setback. To get back 
on track requires starting the processes from the beginning: 
defining integration goals; standardizing data, using pre\-built 
detections that often come with security analytic solutions 
and, where possible, tools; and continuing to collaborate 
and build trust across teams and siloes.
63% reported each of the following 
benefits of DevSecOps: operational 
efficiencies; better cloud security; more 
secure, reliable software; a better, more 
proactive security posture.
59% reported fewer security incidents 
as a result of DevSecOps practices.

Goals and Strategies
From next\-to\-zero to 
resilience hero
We noted that security teams are increasingly seen as valued 
partners rather than boxes to check or obstacles to overcome. 
The result (or cause) is deeper collaboration at all levels. 
For an example at the grassroots level, DevSecOps is 
pretty much everywhere. Only 3% of respondents say their 
organization does not leverage DevSecOps practices, down 
from a 25% holdout rate the previous year.
At the leadership level, we noted that 91% of CISOs are 
collaborating with other leaders on resilience. Sixty\-eight 
percent of CISOs meet with their boards either weekly (29%) 
or monthly (39%). Only 8% meet less than quarterly. And the 
top results of these meetings, according to respondents,
have been:Improved ability to collaborate across business units 
(46%)Improved perception of security by other parts of the 
organization (44%)Better prioritization of security spending (43%)Increased security funding (42%)Instilling of cybersecurity initiatives across broader 
culture (42%)
Across the board, collaborative practices are helping security 
teams hold the line against increasingly sophisticated 
attackers.
Notably, respondents in Europe 
were more likely to report 
positive results, beating the global 
average every time, usually by 4\-9 
percentage points.

Recommendations
Security teams need to work with the entire 
organization to succeed. Here are eight ways that 
the teams who make the best partners are building 
more resilient organizations.
The State of Security 2023\|Splunk 24
Recommendations
True organizational resilience lies not only with the security teams crucial efforts to improve threat 
detection and incident response, but through holistic collaboration. In the organizations weve 
worked with, resilience has been strongest with a collaborative approach in which everything 
 from software development and infrastructure monitoring to business continuity planning 
brings security leaders to the table with IT and business executives to protect the organization.
The theme of trusted partnership ran through our findings in this years survey, and when we look 
at how those most trusted organizations pursue their mission, certain recommendations emerge. 
The first four tie directly into the value of cross\-organizational partnership.
1\. Invest in resilience. 
Security teams that are seen as enablers have definitive 
resilience investment plans for solutions that:Increase visibility throughout the entire technology 
environment (48% versus 38% of the roadblocks)Accelerate response and remediation of incidents
(53% versus 39%)Speed the recovery of customer and user services
(50% versus 40%)Combine cyber resilience efforts with traditional 
business continuitydisaster recovery preparation (54% 
versus 39%)
1\. Embrace functional convergence. 
Teams seen as enablers are 2\.5x as likely (32% versus 13% of 
the roadblock cohort) to note that their security operations 
team is collaborating with all adjacent functional areas 
included in the survey ITOps, app dev, observability and 
digital experience.
1\. Use data and analytics to optimize 
threat detection and response. 
Security teams seen as enablers more often leverage 
analytics to identify cyber risks (38% versus 26%), 
improve threat detection (40% versus 25%), accelerate 
investigations (35% versus 27%) and automate remediation 
(38% versus 22%). As these teams efforts to build data\-
driven efficiencies across detection, investigation and 
response improve security operations results, theyll 
likewise continue to elevate the security teams status
with the business.
1\. Plan for resilience. 
The business enablers are much more apt to report 
that their organization has a formal approach to cyber 
resilience, instituted organization\-wide (32% versus 19% 
of those teams seen as roadblocks). This is essential. Being 
an enabler is not just about collegiality. It correlates with 
actually improving your enterprise\-wide posture
on resilience.
The State of Security 2023\|Splunk 25
Recommendations
From the security perspective, resilience emerges from a complete approach to the threat lifecycle. 
Data and analytics tools help you detect anomalies, while solid playbooks, effectively automated, help 
you respond faster. Then a unified approach to security operations allows teams to overcome the 
problem of having to swivel from one disjointed tool to another. (Were always up to help with that, BTW.) 
These next recommendations are also actions more often undertaken by the enabler teams, though 
there is not necessarily a direct correlation between these actions and effective collaboration. We note 
them as additional best practices of organizations that have used cross\-team partnership to improve 
security posture, instill broader resilience and increase their budgets.
say yes to the organizations cloud transformation projects, 
which is part of why they are held in higher esteem. SURGes 
Ryan Kovar notes, Its always better to be a team that can say 
yes than a team that says no.
1\. Invest against ransomware risk. 
Enablers are much more likely to report increasing investment, 
for the expressed purpose of helping mitigate ransomware risk. 
Not only is protecting against ransomware important in itself, 
but enablers proactive steps to protect against this high\-profile 
threat should also score points with the business leaders and 
build a more effective relationship. Specific ways enablers 
do that:Advanced analytics for anomaly detection
(35% versus 18%)SOAR solutions (35% versus 21%)Endpoint detection and response (34% versus 17%)Privileged account monitoring (30% versus 20%)
1\. Focus on the foundational. 
When security teams are seen as enabling partners, they get 
the basics right. The obstacleroadblock teams are more 
likely to say that a lack of basic hygiene on IT assets remains 
a key challenge to preventing security incidents (28% versus 
19% of those seen as enablers). This is interesting, because 
youd think that the roadblock security org would be more 
rigid about enforcing basic protocols. It seems that the more 
collaborative teams actually have better mastery of the 
basics, as well.
1\. Cloud security is key. 
Enablers are more likely than the roadblock group (31% versus 
20%) to place importance on identifying misconfigured cloud 
workloads, misalignment with best practice frameworks 
like CIS, etc. We believe that more rigorous cloud workload 
hardening puts these security teams in a better position to 
The State of Security 2023\|Splunk 26
Recommendations
1\. Take a proactive stance against 
supply chain threats. 
As with ransomware, the teams that are enablers are 
visibly more proactive about supply chain risk. Again, the 
benefits are both improved security and resilience and 
further establishing the credibility and partnership that 
makes security a more effective force in the organization. 
Specifically, these actions are favored by enablers against 
the specter of supply chain attacks:More frequent meetings between the CISO and 
executives andor the board of directors (26% versus 
15%)Conducting incident response activities like threat 
hunting andor forensic investigations (25% versus 13%)Assessing whether current security controls would 
preventdetect SCAs (30% versus 15%)Increasing log inspection (26% versus 16%)
We all know that no action, set of actions, protocol or arcane 
supernatural ritual will make our organizations attack\-proof. 
But the strategies and tactics of those organizations that 
have had the most success becoming strategic partners 
to their broader organizations are great ways to begin to 
minimize risk while building greater resilience to withstand 
any storm.

Year\-over\-year (over year) highlights
Notable changes over time in global averages
2022 was a rough year for keeping up with security 
requirements. While 49% in 2021 said it was slightly or much 
more difficult to keep up, the number jumped to 66% in 2022, 
before settling to 53% this year:

The biggest change over time among those respondents 
who found it harder to keep up with security requirements 
regarded the more sophisticated threat landscape. In 2021, 
48% indicated that problem, dropping to 38% in both 2022 
and 2023\. (Our 2021 research was conducted not quite a year 
into the global Covid\-19 pandemic.)
We asked respondents what type of attacks theyd suffered 
in the previous two years. In every case there was a large 
jump from 2021 to 2022, and a slight increase or steady 
number between 2022 and 2023\. Examples:Data breach: 39% in 2021, 49% in 2022, 52% in 2023Ransomware: 31% in 2021, 45% in 2022, 49% in 2023Business email compromise: 42% in 2021, 51% in 2022,

Country highlights
Snapshots of the global state of security
Canada
Respondents in Canada are generally more anxious about 
rising threats and security requirements; 76% say keeping up 
with security requirements has gotten harder over the last two 
years, versus 51% in the rest of the world.
The pessimism may be earned. Canadian organizations more 
often report security incidents in the recent past, including 
system compromises by bad actors (62% versus 51% in the 
rest of world) and breaches (65% versus 51% in the rest of 
world). Canadian respondents also report greater struggles 
with critical workload uptime and availability: 33% say theyve 
seen weekly or more frequent outages among business\-
critical applications as a result of security incidents versus 19% 
of their U.S. peers.
On the bright side, Canadian orgs perform above the mean for 
both MTTD and MTTR.MTTD: 39% of Canadians say their mean time to detect is 
two weeks or less, versus 26% in the United States.MTTR: Canadians are also more likely than U.S. respondents 
to say their recovery time can be measured in minutes (24% 
versus 14%). 
So, while Canadian orgs struggle with more incidents and 
more frequent downtime, they display relatively high agility in 
handling issues.
Australia and New Zealand
Ransomware is not exactly top\-of\-mind in Australia and New 
Zealand (ANZ): Just 19% call it a top focus area for next year, 
versus 29% of respondents in the rest of the Asia\-Pacific 
region. Possibly related: organizations in ANZ seem to rely 
more on cyber insurance for ransomware than their peers, so 
maybe system lockouts are just a cost of doing business. We 
also saw more focus in ANZ on zero trust, less on ransomware 
 more reliance on insurance. 
Among organizations that have been the victim of successful 
ransomware attacks, 38% in ANZ say they have most often 
had their insurance company pay (versus 21% of their peers 
in the rest of the world). Maybe the insurance rates are better 
there, since ransoms in ANZ tend to be lower in ANZ versus 
the rest of the world. So far.
Other notable findings:CISOs tend to meet less often with their LOB peers: Just 
14% say their CISO provides weekly briefings on security 
posture less than half the frequency (30%) reported by 
respondents in the rest of the world.Though ANZ orgs are slightly more likely to call DevSecOps 
a fairly significant focus area, they report less success with 
it. Only 49% say DevSecOps has resulted in a reduction in 
incidents (versus 60% in the rest of the world), and only 
48% say it has helped with compliance (versus 63%).
The State of Security 2023\|Splunk 30
Appendix
Canadians are also more likely than U.S. respondents to 
say that DevSecOps practices are increasing collaboration 
between security and development teams (73% versus 
63%) and improving compliance (71% versus 59%). 
Canadians also voice more faith in AIs ability to fortify
the SOC: 61% say AI technologies outperform human 
analysts at identifying fraudulent actions, versus 40% in
the United States.
France
French respondents really feel like theyre on top of things. 
Just 14% say staying ahead has gotten much harder, versus 
29% of peers elsewhere in Europe, and 24% across the rest 
of the world. Two potential reasons: 
1\.French respondents less often say that finding skilled 
labor is a challenge (10%, versus 23% in the rest of 
Europe and 26% in the rest of the world). 
2\.Only 12% of French respondents say theyre inundated 
with false positives andor alerts lacking context not 
quite half the rate of European peers (25%) or the rest of 
the world (26%). 
As in other countries where concerns run lower (see 
Germany, on the following page), incidents are also fewer:29% of French orgs report breaches in the past two 
years, versus 61% across the rest of Europe.23% report compliance violations, versus 54% elsewhere 
in Europe.26% report insider attacks, versus 53%.27% report account takeover attacks, versus 52%.
The French see fewer security\-related business\-critical 
outages, too: 6% suffer them weekly, versus 40% in the rest 
of Europe; and 22% say that outages come yearly at most, 
versus 6%.
French respondents report comparable progress on 
resiliency, but there is nuance: 61% say their resiliency 
investments for the next year will focus on accelerating 
incident response and remediation (versus 40% in the rest 
of Europe) while their European peers are more focused 
on the ability to recover a known good copy of data (42% 
elsewhere in Europe, versus 31% in France).
Also noteworthy: French respondents struggle more with 
tool complexity.On general security challenges, 29% struggle to manage 
too many disconnected security point tools, versus 19% 
in the rest of the region.On cloud\-specific challenges, 37% say the use of multiple 
cybersecurity controls increases cost and complexity 
(versus 24% in the rest of the region). 
Both data points indicate that French teams should pursue 
simplification and rationalization of point tools without 
sacrificing security efficacy, of course.

Appendix
Germany
Only 38% of German respondents say that keeping up with 
threats and security requirements has gotten harder in the last 
two years compared to a weary 61% of respondents in other 
European countries, and 54% across the rest of the world.
Maybe German confidence comes from their progress in 
terms of resilience: 27% report having a formal, organization\-
wide approach to cyber resilience, compared to just 18% of 
other respondents in the region (putting Germans in line with, 
not ahead of, global norms).
It might also be that German orgs have seen fewer incidents. 
Just 40% report having been breached in the last two years, 
versus 57% across other surveyed European markets and 
53% across the rest of the world. German respondents also 
cite fewer compliance violations (25% versus 52% in other 
European nations surveyed), insider attacks (32% versus 50%), 
and business email compromise (36% versus 63%).
On the downside, German response to those incidents that do 
happen is more sluggish. Post\-incident analyses show that in 
Germany, bad actors have access to systems for nearly three 
months before the organization is aware, versus less than two 
months among other European respondents. MTTR is slower 
by a similar margin.
More differences: German respondents more often say that 
finding skilled security staff has gotten harder for them (33% 
versus 18% among others in Europe). Adding to this, German 
respondents report more hesitance around AI. Only 30% say 
AI is capable of outperforming analysts at anomaly detection 
(versus 53% of other respondents in the rest of the region). 
They also have made less progress around security operations 
automation and orchestration: Only 29% report extensive 
progress here versus 40% of their peers in the region. 
Skills scarcity, combined with less investment in AI and 
automation, may put German organizations on a path where 
security teams will eventually struggle more to keep up.
India
Data from India presents a daunting picture. On the 
one hand, Indian teams are very well\-resourced: 66% of 
respondents report more than 25 FTE resources in their 
SOC versus 36%, on average, in the rest of the world. On the 
other hand, theyre really scrambling to keep up:42% of Indian orgs report being overwhelmed by the 
number of attacks (versus 23% in the rest of the world).44% report being inundated with false positives
(versus 24%). 
Part of the problem seems to be the complexity of their tool 
ecosystems: 48% say their security stack is too complex, 
compared to 28% in the rest of the world.
The result, unsurprisingly, is that respondents in India more 
often report having been breached in the last two years 
(59% versus 45% of respondents elsewhere in the broad 
Asia\-Pacific region) and incidents are causing negative 
business outcomes at higher rates, including reduced 
company valuation (42% versus 25% in the rest of the region).
The good news is that CISOs are rising to the challenge: 33% 
report briefing line\-of\-business leaders on the organizations 
security posture weekly (versus 16% across the rest of Asia\-
The State of Security 2023\|Splunk 32
Appendix
Pacific). The efforts are paying off, with 57% of respondents 
saying this has directly led to greater prioritization of security 
investments (versus 42% in the rest of the region). 
Another bright spot is that organizations in India appear to 
be converging aspects of their security operations with 
complimentary functions more often than their peers: 42% 
say they are converging security operations with all areas 
included in the survey (observability, digital experience, ITOps 
and application development) versus 25% in the rest of the 
region. Attribute it to enthusiasm for the potential benefits: 
74% aim to improve visibility into risks (versus 53% in the rest 
of the region); 64% aim to identify issues sooner (versus 51%), 
and 70% converge aspects of security and other functions to 
improve cross\-functional collaboration (versus 53%).
Japan
The Japanese are more focused on ransomware: 35% of 
respondents list it as a top\-three initiative for the next year, 
versus 23% across the rest of the Asia\-Pacific region. And it 
looks like that focus is paying off: 40% of Japanese orgs report 
suffering a ransomware attack in the past two years, versus 
50% across the rest of the world.
In other areas, Japans focus lags:Fewer Japanese organizations have a formal approach to 
cyber resilience that has been implemented organization\-
wide across critical systems (23% versus 34% in the rest of 
the region).Fewer Japanese orgs plan investments in resiliency 
technology to increase visibility (37% versus 46% in the 
rest of the region) or to better understand the downstream 
impacts of incidents (40% versus 50%).
Organizations in Japan also appear to be more complacent 
when it comes to software supply chain attacks. Only 15% 
report that recent incidents have led to more meetings 
between the CISO and other business leaders (15% versus 29% 
of respondents in the rest of the region) or to updates of their 
vendor risk management policies (16% versus 26%). 
Singapore
Singaporean respondents concerns are often very different 
from the rest of the worlds worries.
Start with supply chain: Singaporean orgs are less likely to 
report software supply chain security as a top area of focus 
for the coming year (23% versus 33% in the rest of the world). 
In fact, only 38% of Singaporean organizations say theyve 
significantly increased that focus following recent software 
supply chain attacks (versus 70% of respondents in the rest 
of the world). And theyve less often taken actions specifically 
aimed at mitigating software supply chain risk, such as:Hiring third\-party service providers to conduct a risk 
assessment (15% versus 26% in the rest of the world)Adopting more thorough software supply chain security 
policies (15% versus 23%)Conducting penetration testing or red team exercises (15% 
versus 25%)
Second example: ransomware. Singaporean respondents are 
less likely to say that their organization has implemented, or 
The State of Security 2023\|Splunk 33
Appendix
increased investment in, key controls to help with ransomware, 
including:Endpoint detection and response (17% versus 30% in the 
rest of the world)Solutions to implement ransomware detection rules (17% 
versus 26%)Advanced analytics for anomaly detection (22% versus 32%)
Finally, respondents in Singapore are increasing investment in 
security at a lower rate than their peers: Just 27% say that their 
organization will increase spending significantly over the next 
12\-24 months (versus 59% across the rest of the world).
While Singapores security teams dont report a higher 
incidence of ransomware or supply chain attacks to date, their 
lower focus and lower funding elevates future risk.
United Kingdom
The security picture in the UK is bleak. UK respondents report 
having suffered from a recent breach at twice the rate of their 
peers in Western Europe (68% versus 34%) and have run 
afoul of regulations more often (64% versus 24%). Moreover, 
UK respondents are more likely to say that these incidents 
have had real consequences, such as hurting their companys 
valuation (37% versus 25%).
No surprise, then, that UK respondents more often report high 
levels of anxiety about keeping up with security requirements 
and threats (35% say it has gotten much harder over the last two 
years versus 12% of respondents in the rest of Western Europe).
Two key drivers: 26% of respondents say they are 
overwhelmed by false positives and alerts that lack context 
(versus 15% across the rest of Western Europe) and 30% 
say their cybersecurity posture is based on regulatory 
requirements rather than security best practices (versus 20% 
across the region).
Resilience also lags: 25% of UK respondents say their security 
teams have not yet developed a formal resilience strategy 
 five times the rate of organizations in the rest of the world. 
And just 16% have a formal approach to cyber resilience 
that has been instituted organization\-wide (versus 35% of 
organizations in the rest of the world).
UK respondents know they have work to do:Theyre targeting larger reductions in both MTTD (48% 
versus 41% across other European markets) and MTTR 
(67% versus 48%).They understand the value of resilience, strongly agreeing 
that not increasing resilience will put them at risk of losing 
customers (59% versus 35% across other European 
markets) and being out\-innovated due to disruptions and 
lost productivity (57% versus 28%).They have also significantly increased their focus on third\-
party risk assessment activity as a result of recent software 
supply chain attacks more often than their peers (79% 
versus 64%).

United States
U.S. respondents are generally less anxious about keeping up 
with security requirements and the rising threat landscape 
than their peers: 44% say that it has gotten harder over the 
last two years, versus 76% of non\-U.S. North America, and 
56% in the rest of the world. Several factors contribute to U.S. 
organizations lower\-stress vibes. Two important ones:
1\.Staffing seems less of a pain point. Only 20% of U.S. 
respondents cite an understaffed security team as a key 
challenge, versus 30% among other respondents in North 
America, and 23% in the rest of the world). U.S. respondents 
report fortifying their internal teams with managed services 
at a higher rate: 54% say the majority of their SOC workload 
is handled by partners versus 41% of their peers in the 
region (and 56% in the rest of the world).
2\.U.S. orgs have placed a greater emphasis on resiliency 
as a security tenet. Forty\-five percent report that their 
organization has a formal approach to cyber resilience 
that has been instituted organization\-wide across critical 
systems, compared to just 25% of respondents in the rest 
of the world.
These differentiators are helping U.S. organizations fare 
better when it comes to security incidents. Regionally, U.S. 
respondents are less likely to report experiencing, in the past 
two years, a data breach (51% versus 65% in the rest of North 
America), business email compromise (42% versus 58%), 
DDoS attacks (39% versus 53%), and system compromises 
(46% versus 62%). This led to fewer instances of downtime for 
business\-critical workloads (mean frequency per year:
19 versus 25\).
Strategically, U.S. respondents are more apt to say their 
organization will emphasize DevSecOps (37% versus 28% in 
the rest of the world) and security automation (41% versus 
35%) over the next year, but they may face higher levels of 
exposure to ransomware, with just 19% saying this is a top 
security initiative (versus 30% in the rest of the world).

Industry highlights
Standout data points for four select industries worldwide.Higher levels of fragmentation (across both teams 
and environments) may be contributing to complexity, 
though communications respondents are more likely 
to say that, going forward, their organizations will 
emphasize platform approaches to security (57% 
versus 49%).2\.CISOs in this industry are less engaged with senior 
business leaders. Just 17% of respondents in this sector 
report that their CISO has weekly discussions with 
executives about overall security posture and key metrics 
(versus 30% of respondents in all other industries). 
One of the key outcomes of these types of discussions, 
and their frequency, is increased funding for the security 
team. Given that CISOs at communications companies 
have less frequent touchpoints with their business 
leaders, it is not surprising to note that respondents 
at these organizations are less likely to report their 
organizations will be significantly increasing security 
spending over the next 24 months (45% versus 57% 
among other industries).Communications and Media
Data from the communications and media industry points to 
two notable trends: 
1\.Security tool complexity appears to be a bigger 
issue. When asked about their SOC operations, 
communications and media respondents are more 
apt to say that their analysts spend too much time 
pivoting between too many disparate security tools and 
management consoles, with little, if any, integration, 
which inhibits a comprehensive and timely response 
(47% versus 37% among respondents in other industries). 
The data reveals possible contributing factors:Communications respondents more often say 
that their existing security tools dont support 
cloud environments (27% versus 19% across other 
industries), meaning they may have felt the need to 
adopt separate solutions for cloud environments.Communications respondents are also less likely to 
say theyre converging aspects of IT operations with 
security (75% versus 82%).

Financial Services
Respondents in the financial services sector stand out from 
peers in other industries in three ways:
1\.Theyve had more success mitigating risks associated 
with ransomware. Thirty\-two percent of respondents say 
theyve had data and systems held hostage, versus 45% in 
other industries. Financial firms also are more likely to have 
madeincreased investments in four areas with expressed 
intent of helping with ransomware detection, prevention 
and response:Email security hardening (41% versus 31% across 
the board)Creationimplementation of specific ransomware 
detection rules (32% versus 24%)Advanced analytics solution for anomaly detection
(36% versus 30%)Security information and event management (SIEM) 
solution (39% versus 32%)
2\.Theyve had more success preventing supply chain 
attacks. Forty percent of financial firms report that theyve 
experienced a supply chain attack, versus 48% across 
other industries. Notably, financial firms are more likely
to have:Reassessedchanged policies toward vendor risk 
management (27% versus 21% across other industries)Performed an assessment of current security 
controls to determine whether they would prevent
detect supply chain attacks (31% versus 25%)Increased questionnairesaudits of their software 
supply chain vendors (30% versus 22%)3\.Theyve had less success instituting DevSecOps 
initiatives. Respondents in the finance space are 
significantly less likely to say that their DevSecOps 
initiatives had delivered benefits for them in areas
such as:Repeatability across software development projects 
(56%, trailing other industries, which averaged 63%)Cybersecurity proactivity (57% versus 65% across 
other industries)Collaboration between their cybersecurity, 
development and operations teams 
(67% versus 59%)Ability to respond to audits (55% versus 62%)Security of sensitive cloud\-resident data 
(65% versus 55%)
Given these more muted results, its not surprising that 
financial services respondents are more likely to report 
DevSecOps as a focus area for the next year
(40% versus 28%).The State of Security 2023\|Splunk 37

Manufacturing
Respondents in the manufacturing sector indicate acute 
problems with staff and skills scarcities. For example, 56% of 
them say that they dont have enough people to handle the 
increasing volume of security events (versus 47% across other 
industries). Similarly, manufacturers more often say that they 
struggle both to hire enough staff, with the right skill sets, to 
handle the workload (31% versus 22%).
Not surprisingly, then, respondents at manufacturing 
companies are more apt to say that, in the past 12 months, 
staffing issues contributed to multiple instances of:Considering finding a new job due to their current workload 
(51% versus 39% across other industries)Team members being asked to lead projects without the 
requisite experience (60% versus 40% elsewhere)A project failing (52% versus 36%)
Furthermore, manufacturers are less likely to report that their 
SOCs run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year: 17% versus 27% 
across other industries. Manufacturers more often operate 
their SOC only during business hours: 30% versus 13% across 
other industries.
Manufacturers appear to be trying to close their skill gaps 
with automation and AI. They are more apt to say that 
theyre using machine learning technologies extensively 
for security analytics (43% versus 32%) and have deployed 
security and operations automation and orchestration 
technologies extensively (44% versus 35%). However, their 
greater likelihood to report having suffered weekly outages 
of business\-critical systems due to security incidents (44% 
versus 19%) suggests that these approaches have not 
completely offset their staffing challenges.
Public Sector
A common theme from our public sector respondents is that 
theyre struggling to keep pace with the risk landscape. More 
than two\-thirds (68%) explicitly say that keeping up with 
cybersecurity requirements (i.e deployingtuning controls, 
monitoring network behavior, following threat intelligence, etc.) 
is more difficult today than it was two years ago (compared to 
52% of respondents from other industries). 
Alert volumes in particular appear to be a pain point, with 34% 
of public sector respondents saying keeping up with security 
alerts is among their top security challenges (versus 23% of 
respondents in other industries).
Two causes are at play: tool complexity and staffing shortages. 
Public sector respondents are more likely than their private 
sector counterparts to report that their organization suffers 
from both issues (37% versus 26% across other industries).
Additionally, public sector respondents are consistently more 
negative about AIs ability to lighten the security teams load. 
They are less likely to report that AI can outperform human 
analysts today in areas such as:Threat hunting (24% versus 46% across other fields)Triaging and prioritizing events (43% versus 28%)Identifying anomalous user behavior (30% versus 47%)
As a sector, these organizations would be well served to 
investigate how intelligent automation can help their team 
better keep pace which may help close the recovery time 
gap observed in the industry (a mean time to recover of 22\.3 
hours, versus 15\.1 hours for other industries).
