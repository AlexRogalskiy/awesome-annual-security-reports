Driven by events no one could have foreseen, leaders in 
recent years have pushed their companies and themselves 
beyond their comfort zones: out of the office to remote 
workplaces; into the cloud; along chains of supply that are 
almost completely digital. And with each new venture has 
come new cyber risks. 
CISOs and cyber teams are rising to the challenge.
C\-suites are joining forces with them, recognising that
their bold moves have increased their organisations cyber 
risk exposure.

New challenges for 2023
 
Only 9% of the respondents feel highly confident that
they can effectively meet all disclosure requirements 
even as pressure mounts from regulators to report
cyber incidents.In Europe, for instance, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity 
(ENISA) requires that critical service providers to report 
to national authorities in the event of any significant 
cybersecurity incident.The US Securities and Exchange Commission is 
considering a rule that would require publicly held 
companies to disclose their cyber risk management, 
strategy, governance and material cyber incidents.And proposed US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) rules, mandated by the Cyber 
Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 
(CIRCIA) signed into law last March, would require 
organisations in 16 critical infrastructure sectors to report 
major cyber attacks and breaches within 72 hours and 
to report within 24 hours any ransomware payments they 
make.
 
Senior executives are bracing not only for a catastrophic 
cyber attack but also for global recession, a new health 
crisis, persistent inflation, and supply chain bottlenecks. 
Yet only 7% approach resilience in an integrated fashion.
 
Consumers, consumer\-friendly regulators, privacy 
advocates and ESG activists are gaining ground. Data 
security and privacy are the Achilles heel of many 
organisations. Fewer than 5% of senior executives 
say they always implement 10 standard and leading 
practices to protect and govern customer data.

Cybersecurity has become a dynamic field, rapidly adjusting 
and shifting to keep apace with business inventiveness.
Agility is whats needed for the tougher challenges ahead.
How can you continue to make a difference? Where should 
CISOs and cyber teams wield influence for the greatest effect?
The C\-suite playbook on cybersecurity, featuring our
latest Global Digital Trust Insights, highlights what youve 
done, what youre doing now, and what you need to do to 
tackle the challenges of 2023 with your fellow executives, 
all working together to build cyber\-ready futures.
Cyber in the suite spot
CISO are seizing the initiative to truly lead to step out 
of their independent cyber\-specialist role and into one of 
partnering with not just with a few executives, but the entire 
C\-suite. These collaborations have never been more critical.
Forty\-two percent of senior executives say cyber breaches 
of their systems have increased since 2020\. Executives and 
boards should ask again and again, Are we affected?
and, if not, Are we vulnerable?
More than a quarter had a consequential data breach in the 
past three years that cost more than $1 million. Around 10% 
suffered costs of $10 million or more, CISOs and
CFOs reported.
To CFOs, the most devastating consequences when a breach 
(other than a data breach) occurred were:
 
Downtime or disruptions
 
Damage to service and product quality
 
Lost contracts and business opportunities
10
PwC\|Global Digital Trust Insights 2023
C\-suite playbook on cyber
To privacy and data executives who work with the public, a 
breachs most dire effects were:
 
Lost customers
 
Costs to recover data (not counting ransom payments)
 
Lost customer data (if not recovered)
These gut\-wrenching moments can serve as a catalyst to 
collaboration, sharpening awareness of a single breachs 
ripple effects from shop floor to boardroom and calling the 
entire C\-suite to act together. 
As a result, the C\-suite has renewed its resolve to do better 
on cyber and privacy. To get there, top executives are starting 
to understand the need to work as a cohesive unit the 
suite spot. 
At the center is the CISO, empowered by the CEO to 
advocate, collaborate, and orchestrate a better cyber future. 
Forty\-six percent of CEOs 49% at previously breached 
organisations want to give the CISO more authority to 
drive collaboration on security next year. 
A note:
Management teams are organised differently around 
the world, so we may refer to C\-suite titles that might 
not exist in your organisation. 
Consider the titles as shorthand for the executive 
tasked with cybersecurity in the organisation (CISO) 
who works with the executives responsible for the 
overall business (CEO), management oversight and 
governance (the board), technology infrastructure (CIO 
 CTO), cyber investments (CFO), operations and supply 
chain (COO), risk management (CRO), data (CDO CPO) 
and human resources (CHRO).

More than half of CEOs say theyll 
demand a cyber risk management 
plan for each major business or 
operational change. And more than 
half say theyll spearhead major 
initiatives such as streamlining 
the supply chain and eliminating 
products that weaken the enterprises 
cyber posture. 
CEOs at companies that have suffered breaches in the past 
are even more determined to change how cyber gets done. 
CEOs want more information to help them do a better job 
overseeing their organisations cyber programmes.
More than 35% prioritise three areas for better reporting: 
 
Cyber risk assessments and practices
 
Business continuity plans, contingency, and recovery 
plans in the case of a cyber incident
 
A dashboard on key cyber risks
CISOs are learning how to give their CEOs just the right 
information on their cyber programme and the risks their 
organisation faces.Message to the CEO
Where can you, the CEO, make the most difference in 
cybersecurity? Big changes may be the most effective way
to improve cyber posture and only you can instigate them.
Are you tolerating avoidable, unnecessary complexities in 
your operations and technologies? This needs to change. 
But so often, investigations after a major cyber breach reveal 
weaknesses more systemic than technological, caused by 
a lack of focus among enterprise leaders on addressing 
weaknesses that teams knew existed. Are you ready to support 
a dramatic turnaround? It could be the most effective fix.
Perhaps a disconnect among your senior executives or 
between your business and cyber functions is slowing your 
efforts at growth an app for consumer use, perhaps; a new 
business line that uses artificial intelligence; expansion into a 
new market; or the use of the Industrial Internet of Things in 
your factory. Isnt it time you joined forces to secure it all?

Boards can spur better cyber reporting to improve oversight
Boards are more engaged in cyber as 
their companies face increasing risks. 
Fifty\-four percent say their organisation 
has taken on more cyber risks as it 
pursues more digitisation, and 44% 
report an increase in cyber breaches
into their system since 2020\. 
They recognise the challenge of keeping 
up with cyber. Today, less than half of board respondents say 
that their board governs cyber very effectively in six areas. 
Fewer than half, for instance, say they very effectively 
understand the causes and effects of cyber risks (37%) or 
oversee the alignment of cyber risk management to business 
needs (43%). Only 9% of board respondents say that their 
board governs cyber very effectively across all areas. 
But the future of cyber oversight could be different. 
Corporate directors are willing to learn about cyber and 
devote time to it. They say these will help them do a better 
job governing cybersecurity in 2023:
 
Internal board training by management (47%)
 
Increased frequency of meetings focused on cyber (47%)
 
Improved reporting on cyber incidents, practices, and 
improvements (44%)
 
Adding a board member with cyber expertise (43%)
CISOs and the C\-suite can help boards get savvy about the 
cybersecurity of their organisation, especially on these top 
improvements that boards would like to see in cyber reporting:
 
A scorecard dashboard that helps board members 
understand the key cyber risks to the organisation with 
relevant metrics
 
The organisations cybersecurity strategy and how it is 
aligned with its overall strategy
 
The business continuity, contingency and recovery plans 
in the event of a cyber incident
Boards know they need to be better cyber stewards
Oversight of the alignment of cyber risk management to the 
business needs

The new era of cyber transparency
Stakeholders clamor for more information about how 
companies manage their cyber risk exposure. 
Regulators want visibility into cyber practices because they 
want to protect citizens from fraud and loss of privacy, help 
investors make better decisions, and prevent industry\- or 
system\-wide disruptions. India has published guidance on 
cyber incident notification required under the Information 
Technology Act. The UK Financial Reporting Council has 
issued guidance about digital security risk disclosures after it 
found that current disclosures by some FTSE 350 companies 
are not meeting investor needs and are often boilerplate 
and overly static. In addition to the rules pending with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (proposal) and the 
Cybersecurity \& Infrastructure Security Agency (law), the 
New York State Department of Financial Services is weighing 
a proposal that turns leading practices into regulatory 
requirements for covered entities. 
Investors are looking for consistent and comparable disclosures 
so they can put their money in companies that fit their needs. 
Cyber incidents can affect shareholder value temporarily
or permanently. 
Individuals know how their data and privacy are vulnerable 
to cyber breaches. Business partners want their data 
and other assets to be safe. These stakeholders want 
to understand how much they can trust in the ability of 
Message to corporate directors
CALL TO ACTION: First, allot more time to the CISO and cyber matters on your agenda. Second, 
dont settle for board reporting that doesnt give you confidence and insights that the organisation is 
managing the cyber risks related to its strategic moves. Cybersecurity is not an end state, so monitor 
how the company is making progress in its cyber posture and ability to defend against emerging 
threats. Ask to take part in exercises that help you understand your organisations cyber resilience.
businesses and entire systems to withstand increasing cyber 
threats.
The C\-suite sees an upside to all this transparency. Four\-
fifths of senior executives in our survey agree that mandatory 
disclosure of cyber incidents, with comparable and consistent 
formats, is necessary to gain stakeholder confidence and trust. 
But fewer than 10% are confident that their enterprise can 
comply. More than half are not confident that they: 
 
Can provide required information about a material or 
significant incident within the required reporting period 
after the incident (58% not confident)
 
Can assess the materiality of a cyber incident for purposes 
of reporting (58%)
 
Can describe the relevant cyber expertise on the board for 
purposes of reporting (59%)
 
Have a policy stating which information can or cannot be 
disclosed regarding cyber incidents (60%)
 
Can provide information about third\-party risk 
management (63%)
CALL TO ACTION: CISOs can position their teams to work with the CFO, general counsel and other 
senior executives to prepare to translate strategy and practices into an accurate, cohesive and 
compelling narrative on the companys cyber risk management practices. The new era of cyber 
transparency means that CISOs should become adept at presenting information in a way that the board, 
senior management and investors can understand and act upon. It requires a communication strategy 
thats different from the everyday jargon of cybersecurity.

CIOs, CTOs, and CISOs tackle cloud security
Is our cloud security plan as agile as our business is, itself,
in the cloud? Thats the question CIOs and CISOs should
be asking now.
Cloud\-based threats are increasing at nearly 40% of 
organisations. Meanwhile, nearly two\-thirds of senior executives 
say they havent fully mitigated the risks of cloud adoption. 
The news isnt all negative. Half of CISOs, CIOs and CTOs 
say theyve made progress in putting governance in place, 
credential management, resource permissioning, cloud 
security configurations and API management.
But only 19% are very confident that their organisation has 
adequately secured all these common cloud\-breach pathways.
The CIO or CTO and their DevOps team may feel eager 
or pressured to take advantage of the agility, speed and 
collaboration working in the cloud affords.

work remains

They may allow developers to stand up projects in a cloud 
environment before security is in place, or lift and shift 
existing systems into the cloud with plans to secure them later. 
These personnel may sidestep the CISO to avoid the 
methodical, security\-first approach the CISO would almost 
certainly advise. In the fast\-paced digital world, the
business side knows, enterprises need speed to achieve
their objectives. When agility and speed are the goals, who 
needs brakes?
But cohesive governance is key, especially in a multi\-cloud 
environment where each cloud service provider has different 
security abilities and requirements. Frequent releases of new 
features and updates means that, like the clouds in the sky, 
your enterprise cloud environment is continually changing. 
In 2023, its time to design an overarching security 
architecture that includes all the cloud platforms your 
enterprise is using. 
Bring together all your enterprise security controls so you
can secure them from one location, and with as much 
automation as possible. 
Build infrastructure\-as\-code (IaC) and DevSecOps tooling
to automatically set the right security checks on all your
cloud platforms.
Message to CIOs and CTOs
Form alliances with your CISO and DevSecOps team.
Adopt the shift left paradigm and start putting in place 
cloud security mechanisms before cloud use begins or,
if its too late for that, as soon as possible. 
Fast development and strong controls can go hand\-in\-hand.
Leading companies design and administer controls that 
operate not at the sluggish pace often associated with 
oversight, but at the quick and agile speed of DevOps.
In these organisations, everyone wins. 
CISOs might provide developers with cloud security services 
that are easy to use and conform to the organisations 
security policies. Building an encryption API for developer 
use, for instance, can help speed an applications time to 
market as well as confirm that encryption uses company\-
approved protocols.

CFOs and CISOs get serious about cyber investment risks vs. rewards 
But they arent increasing cyber budgets as much as they did 
for 2022\. While more than a quarter of enterprises expected 
2022 cyber outlays to rise by more than 10%, fewer than
one\-fifth expect that rate of escalation next year. 
Not surprisingly, organisations that have been breached 
were significantly more likely to say that they would boost 
their 2023 cyber spending: 68% versus 55% that have not 
been breached. And among larger enterprises (with yearly 
revenues greater than $1 billion), 10% said their cyber outlays 
would rise by 15% or more.

Many have begun to shift their cyber investment strategy, as 
well. More than half say theyre choosing to a great extent how 
to spend on cyber in line with seven key parameters, including:
 
Aligned with the overall business strategy (55%)
 
Reflecting cyber priorities (55%)
 
Adding value to the organisation (52%)
 
Balancing immediate and long\-term needs (51%)
 
Informed by risk quantification (51%)
 
Considers the risk appetite of the organisation (51%)
 
Allocated well against the risks that the organisation 
faces (51%)
We saw this shift coming in our 2021 survey, in which 50% 
of senior executives said they wanted to see budgets better 
reflecting business strategy, 44% wanted a better budgeting 
process and 44% wanted to quantify risks. 
Fewer than 8%, however, indicated that theyd made this shift 
in every area. Respondents from the largest organisations 
were significantly more likely to say that theyve evolved how 
they invest, with 60% saying their spending supports the 
business strategy, for example.
Modernisation of tech
Cyber tech solutions are at the top of the list of areas that 
CFOs see as key to improving their organisations cyber 
posture.
Indeed, modernisation, especially of operational technology, 
is still a problem at many organisations. Outdated tech 
and managing its vulnerabilities are top barriers to improving 
security of operational technology, CISOs, CIOs, and
CTOs say.
Complexity, too, remains a big concern. Simplifying and 
consolidating the software portfolio is a top 2023 priority 
among respondents that have been breached in the past 
three years. Our 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights report 
foresaw this trend with 75% reporting that their data, 
technology and other operations were too complex, causing 
concerns about cyber risk. 
Its telling that another major focus among the previously 
breached is the elimination of technical debt the literal 
and figurative costs of cutting corners in development for the 
sake of speed. For the rest, however, it ranks near the bottom 
of the list of cyber transformation goals.

Budgeting for cyber is changing
When they budget for cyber, enterprises are taking a more 
expansive approach. Nearly 4 out of 10 CEOs, CFOs, and 
CISOs tell us their companies now fund cybersecurity 
as a percentage of all tech spending, including OT and 
automation. Another 15% say they budget for cyber as a 
percentage of revenue.

organizations have historically logged and 
stored data points through monitoring. But how 
much have we actually used that data to more

Message to CFOs
Youre right to ask, Are we spending enough and in the 
right areas? Are we getting the right amount of cyber risk 
reduction from our investments?
As tech solutions proliferate, youll need to work with the 
CISO to craft a big\-picture plan to secure your organisation 
at multiple levels while also simplifying and streamlining all 
your companys software. Mind your early cloud deployment 
 the workloads that were lifted and shifted to the cloud. 
They, too, contribute to your technical debt.
The open nature of the cloud also requires organisations to 
tighten their trust parameters to zero. Youll need a big\-
picture plan for yourshift to zero trust architectures. Thirty\-
six percent of CISOs say they have started to implement 
components of zero trust and another 25% will start in the 
next two years.
CALL TO ACTION: As you modernise and simplify 
IT, ask how each incremental amount you spend 
can reduce the most cyber risk. Companies that 
know the monetary costs of risk are more likely to 
secure by design and save.

COOs and CISOs team up on plans to defend against 
rising attacks to the supply chain and OT 
The supply chain is a focal point for cyber and other threats, 
competitive and macroeconomic pressures, and ESG 
concerns.
More than half (56%) of CROs and COOs tell us theyre 
extremely or very concerned about their ability to 
withstand supply chain attacks. 
Only about one\-quarter strongly agree that their operations 
workforce has the needed digital skills, or that they have 
invested enough, to prevent cyber attacks from disrupting 
their supply chain.
And they worry that their ability to control these threats rests 
partly in the hands of third parties that are ill\-equipped to 
protect them. Only one\-fifth strongly agree that their third\-
party partners and suppliers have invested or are doing 
enough to prevent supply chain disruptions from cyber 
attacks; 13% disagree. 
Operational technologies: More, better solutions needed
Only about one\-third of all survey respondents say they have 
fully mitigated the risks associated with the convergence of OT 
and IT or the risks from increased use of Internet of Things. 
Another area of concern to COOs and CROs is operational 
technology (OT) security. As OT technologies and solutions 
grow more sophisticated using artificial intelligence and 
machine learning to increase automation in manufacturing 
plants, for instance organisations are struggling to keep up 
with making their operations secure and safe. 
Not only CROs and COOs see these challenges. CISOs and 
CIOs are aware of them, too. Between them, however, lie 
differences in what each views as the greatest hindrance to 
modern and fully secure operations.
 
Both groups say having inadequate tech solutions is a 
top hindrance to improving OT. They also want solutions 
that specifically address OT security.
 
But for CISOsCIOs, the number\-one obstacle comes 
from using outdated software and vulnerability\-
management tools. Altogether, 27%, including CROs, say 
this is a problem.
 
At the same time, CROsCOOs think a more expansive 
approach to OT cyber risk is in order one that considers 
not only business and financial risks but also health, 
safety and environmental risks. That these concerns arent 
getting equal consideration plays the number\-one role in 
hampering OT improvements, they say.

Message to COOs
As your enterprise operations become increasingly digital, 
you recognise the importance of working with cybersecurity 
teams to keep it all secure and to do more to make up for 
deficiencies among third\-party partners and suppliers. 
Your risk, internal audit and compliance teams may already 
be working with cybersecurity teams on a number of cyber 
tasks. Half of the CROsCOOs surveyed say these teams are 
jointly monitoring and prioritising risks consistently. Another 
one\-third are doing so sometimes. 
This teamwork is paying off. Nearly four\-fifths (79%) of 
respondents say their cyber team has made progress in 
securing OT during the past year. Nearly three\-quarters say 
theyve seen better collaboration between cyber and OT 
teams certainly no coincidence. 
But supply\-chain and OT attacks have not made it to 
the top of list in terms of likely threats, which may create 
complacency. Remain vigilant. Weve already seen this year 
what can happen when companies let their guard down 
regarding the software supply chain, and OT attacks are on 
the rise. Cyber\-threat actors seeking a way into your systems 
often target the point of least resistance, so dont let your 
domain be that point. 
CALL TO ACTION: 
Work actively with your CISO to have your teams 
collaborate on OT and supply chain security from 
daily tasks such as monitoring to bigger\-picture 
ones such as governance. Ask together how you 
can build your resilience to interruptions or delays 
in your supply chain as well as attacks on your 
OT systems. And work with your CIO and CISO 
to establish a process for creating cyber risk 
management plans whenever youre making a 
major change in your operations.
While aware of these deficiencies, CISOs and CIOs also point out that their 
organisations lack a complete and accurate asset inventory of OT data, 
people, systems and facilities critical to operational resilience.

CROs and CISOs responding to risk with resilience
Risk is the word in cyber today. More and more, 
cybersecurity teams are working together with those in risk, 
internal audit and compliance, a sign that cyber is taking an 
important place as an enterprise risk\-management priority. 
A growing number of CROs, CAEs, and chief compliance 
officers recognise that cyber means business. Half of 
respondents say cyber teams are consistently monitoring 
and prioritising risks in tandem with these other functions. 
Roughly another third are doing so some of the time. 
CISO
CISO

Those with a breach in their enterprises history are much more 
likely to consistently respond in tandem to cyber intrusions 
50% as opposed to 38% of non\-breached companies.
The all for one, one for all approach to cyber risk doesnt 
happen as often as it might seem at first glance, however. 
Only 7% say cyber teams work consistently with other risk 
functions in all risk\-related activities. CROsCOOs have work 
to do in this area. 
CROs and COOs do tend to applaud the performance of 
their organisations cyber and privacy teams. Nearly half 
say these teams are meeting important goals exceptionally 
well, including putting controls in place to prevent serious 
disruptions important for business resilience. However, 
only 5% of CROsCOOs think cyber and privacy meet all 
expectations exceptionally. 
Tests of resilience in 2023
Life is what happens while youre making other plans, the 
saying goes. Its also true of business. 
Resilience means being able to stay on track even when 
unexpected problems arise: A catastrophic cyber attack. 
A global recession. A new health crisis or resurgence of 
COVID\-19\. Rising inflation. 
These are our respondents top concerns for the next 12\-24 
months. But few appear ready to handle them with grace.
Taking an all hazards approach to identifying sources of 
disruption is necessary for any organisation in light of todays 
risk environment. Yet only 7% of senior executives say 
theyre taking truly integrated, holistic approaches to five key 
capabilities that define resilience. 
The good news for CROsCOOs is that 62% are handling 
risk holistically. But in all other areas incident response, 
business continuity, disaster recovery roughly half of 
organisations appear to treat each breach as a one\-off 
rather than integrating the lessons learned from the various 
resilience core competencies. 
This approach, CROsCOOs are realising, is akin to patching 
leaks with duct tape rather than making permanent repairs, a 
much more effective approach.

Message to CROs
The 2023 scenarios require the C\-suite to work together. 
Breaches, its said, are inevitable. A graceful response 
one that severely limits the damage bad actors can cause 
is largely a function of the groundwork youve done to lay a 
strong, resilient cyber foundation. 
Increasingly, financial authorities around the world are 
collaborating to test the resilience of financial institutions.
And regulatory guidance and enforcement is beginning to 
spread beyond financial services.
You, in partnership with CISOs, should make a case to the 
CEO and board: true organisational resilience requires much 
coordination among the entire C\-suite, and they need to
lead the way.
CEOs may need the occasional nudge to get past their comfort 
zone, especially if theyre in a state of inertia. They may think 
they dont need to act because the company already has crisis 
management, business continuity or disaster recovery plans. 
But how coordinated are these plans? Has the organisation 
tested them? Can the organisation recover within the time 
objectives it has established?CALL TO ACTION: Revisit your risk appetite so 
you know your resilience limits the specific 
meaning of resilience depends partly on an 
organisations risk tolerance and appetite. Rework 
crisis, business continuity, and disaster recovery 
plans into a cohesive enterprise resilience plan. 
Remain in sync with senior executives so you can 
establish a coordinated approach that keeps the 
company on track if and when issues arise.

Collaboration on data security and privacy protection is urgent
Companies are becoming adept at using data to better 
understand what customers want and give it to them.
Data is now part and parcel of their customer\-centric
digital transformation. 
A third of CMOs, CDOs and CPOs say they always use
data to monitor customer feedback and create personalised 
customer experiences. More than a quarter consistently use 
data to find underserved segments and grow their business. 
To capture lasting value from this transformation,
companies need to process and manage data and
algorithms intelligently and efficiently. At the same time,
they should address public ethics and privacy concerns
and comply with regulatory standards. 
But how many really take customer consent and privacy 
seriously? The approaches to data management and 
governance that senior executives report is eye\-opening 
and at the same time, unsurprising.

To help close the talent gap, CISOs have found three 
approaches to be among the most effective: 
 
Upskilling (45%)
 
Hiring incentives, e.g sign\-in bonuses (41%)
 
Managed services for cyber (36%)
Securing your managed services
Managed security service is second only to network security 
as a top investment priority for cyber in 2023\. 
Just as spending and reliance on managed security providers 
(MSPs) is gaining steam, so has malicious cyber activity 
Companies are finding ways to use managed services securely
Disable managed service provider (MSP) accounts 
that are no longer managing infrastructure
Verify that the networks used for trust relationships with 
managed service providers (MSPs) are suitably 
segregated from the rest of their networks
Review and verify all connections between internal systems, 
managed service provider (MSP) systems, and other networks
Ensure that contractual arrangements with managed service 
providers (MSPs) include backup services that meet their 
resilience and disaster recovery requirements
Apply the principle of least privilege throughout the managed 
service provider and customer network environments and 
immediate update privileges upon changes in administrative roles
Audit the organisations network infrastructure, paying 
particular attention to those on the MSP\-customer boundary, 
to identify and disable unused systems and services
Ensure management of identity providers and 
trusts between the different environments
Ensure that contractual arrangements with MSP include 
incident response and recovery plans that meet their 
resilience and disaster recovery requirements
Implement a comprehensive security event management 
for effective monitoring and logging of systems
Enforce multi\-factor authentication 
across all services and products

Only 2\.2% have fully implemented all 10 practices
targeting MSPs. In May 2022, the cybersecurity authorities 
of the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the United 
States issued a joint advisory to companies for safeguarding 
themselves amid this trend.
About half of the CISOs we surveyed have fully implemented 
a number of measures to manage their third\-party risks. 
Fifty\-seven percent report disabling MSP accounts that are 
no longer managing infrastructure. Forty\-five percent enforce 
multi\-factor authentication across all services and products. 
But more work remains. Only 2\.2% have implemented all 
these security practices across the board.

Message to CHROs
Employee turnover is rising in a variety of markets, while fears 
of recession are causing companies anxiety about hiring 
plans. Amid the uncertainty, they might delay doing anything, 
especially when they know they need to try something new to 
avert the crisis amid the phenomena described variously as 
the great rethink, great resignation and quiet quitting. 
CISOs and risk executives need to help CHROs ascertain 
the cumulative effects and cascading operational risks of 
employee attrition. No matter which creative responses 
businesses employ to retain and hire talent, senior executives 
also need to help manage reputational risks.
CALL TO ACTION: Ask which skills you really need 
in your cyber programme, update how you recruit 
for those, and give your cyber talent incentives 
and growth paths that are reasons to stay. Your 
reliance on managed services and other external 
talent resources will only grow. Add cybersecurity 
measures to contracts.

Scenarios to illustrate need for 
C\-suite collaboration
Weve selected three of the cyber event types most concerning 
to senior executives. 
Although the tactics and techniques in these scenarios might 
require technical expertise to understand, this much should 
be clear: the consequences of each spill over to areas that 
executives in operations, finance, data, and enterprise risk 
management need to address. 
The call to action for each C\-suite executive isnt intended to be 
prescriptive. Instead it illustrates the various angles that might 
need to be addressed for a full and lasting response to cyber 
attack. In cyber, a disengaged executive is a point of failure.

How will the scenarios organisations face in 2023 test senior 
executives ability to work together amid crises and avoid 
business disruptions? 
Catastrophic cyber attack is the nearly unanimous number\-
one concern. Only CFOs ranked it second, after global 
recession and alongside worries about another health crisis 
such as a COVID\-19 resurgence. 
These scenarios require the C\-suite to work together, but 
cybersecurity may be the only problem that requires all hands 
on deck to resolve and one over which an organisation 
arguably has some control. 
Two\-thirds of executives consider cybercriminals to be the 
most significant threat actor to their organisation in the 
coming year. Cyber attacks are a thriving business and make 
lucrative careers for cybercriminals. 
Cybercrime\-as\-a\-service and off\-the\-shelf tools allow criminals 
to perpetrate and orchestrate a variety of profitable attacks. 
Ransomware operations, for instance, now run as businesses 
with the main operator leasing the ransomware from affiliates. 
Cybercriminals can then deploy leased ransomware large\-scale 
across multiple targets. 
Starting in 2021, the PwC Threat Intelligence group also 
saw more commercial quartermasters, or companies selling 
cybercrime tools such as spyware, zero\-day exploits, and 
other types of malware to more customers in many countries.
These global operations make it easier to get started in a life 
of cybercrime: no longer do threat actors need to develop 
their own malware. At the same time, distributed malware 
makes identifying the culprits more difficult.

These commercially available tools are effective against a wide 
array of targets including, perhaps, government officials and 
private sector executives. Organisations that have deemed 
these types of threats outside their realm need to think again.

Attackers exploit a misconfiguration in the companys
cloud\-hosted internet\-facing application and steal user
data to sell on the black market.
The breach:
Costly notifications to data owners. A possible class\-action 
lawsuit against the company. Damage to the enterprises 
reputation. 
Consequences:
Inadequate security, no defence in depth, coding errors, 
inadequate testing of written and library code, improperly 
encrypted data. 
What went wrong:
 
CIO: Enable DevSecOps in application development, 
as well as thorough prelaunch testing. Remediate 
misconfigurations from both users and automated 
deployments.
 
CISO: Establish and enforce policies and procedures 
for securing applications and data, vulnerability and 
penetration testing, regular patching, continuous 
compliance monitoring, and security event and incident 
monitoring (SIEM).
How to work together for better defence:
38% expect more serious attacks via 
the cloud in 2023

Scenario 1: Cloud\-based attacks
 
CTO: Require that cloud service providers and third 
parties provide dashboards and tools to detect 
misconfigurations across their environments.
 
CDO: Confirm that apps comply with privacy 
requirements and that customer data is partitioned and 
encrypted for better protection. Put into place solutions 
that encrypt data at rest, in transit, and while in use.

A manufacturing system is impacted by a ransomware event 
due to exploitable vulnerabilities existing in legacy operating 
systems.
The breach:
Production stops as affected systems are shut down to 
prevent damage from spreading. Impacts ripple through the 
supply chain. 
Consequences:
Hackers exploit unpatched vulnerabilities to inject 
ransomware. The exploited vulnerabilities were previously 
patched in enterprise systems, however due to a lack of patch 
management, monitoring and detection capabilities for the 
legacy systems, the vulnerabilities remained undetected.
What went wrong:
 
CIO: With CISO and CTO, map convergences and critical 
interdependencies between IT and OT systems.
 
CISO: Work with CIO and CTO to require separation of 
IT and OT, develop a secure landing zone that obscures 
OT from direct access, and train employees on proper 
access and incident response roles.
 
CTO: With CISO and CIO, create a plan for patching and 
monitoring endpoints.

A medical employee opens a document in a phishing email, 
activating malware.
The breach:
Service disruption and a near\-complete shutdown of the 
hospital networks.
Consequences:
Antivirus software was running out\-of\-date rules that failed 
to detect malware embedded in the malicious attachment. 
The lack of multi\-factor authentication allowed the attackers 
to obtain initial access. Unnoticed on the corporate network 
for weeks, the cybercriminals conducted reconnaissance of 
the network and eventually compromised a domain admin 
account, giving them elevated privileges to launch malware 
that shut down much of the core IT infrastructure and 
compromised backups. 
What went wrong:
 
CEO: Support security awareness training throughout 
the organisation.
 
CIO: Review the connections between IT systems and 
the organisations environment.
 
CTO: Assess the vulnerability of medical devices in a 
scenario that targets devices.
 
COO: Help CIO, CISO size up effects on patient safety in 
similar scenarios.
 
CISO: Bridge security gaps between IT and operations.
How to work together for better defence:
 
CDO: Work with COO, CISO, CPO to assess damage 
from theftcorruption of customer data.
 
CRO: Conduct test of resilience with crisis and BCDR 
teams. 
 
CFO: Work with CISO, CIO on any disclosures to 
regulators and the public. Review cyber spending, 
including cyber insurance, with CISO, CIO in light of 
discovered vulnerabilities. Decide on your policy for 
ransomware payment. 
 
Board: Get insight on managements tabletop exercise 
to prepare for a ransomware attack. Confirm when 
the board will be informed about a cyber incident or 
ransomware attack.
