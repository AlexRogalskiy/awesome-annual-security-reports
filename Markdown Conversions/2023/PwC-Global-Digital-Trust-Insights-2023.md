How can you continue to make a difference? Where should 
CISOs and cyber teams wield influence for the greatest effect?The C\-suite playbook on cybersecurity, featuring our
latest Global Digital Trust Insights, highlights what youve 
done, what youre doing now, and what you need to do to 
tackle the challenges of 2023 with your fellow executives, 
all working together to build cyber\-ready futures.Cyber in the suite spotCISO are seizing the initiative to truly lead to step out 
of their independent cyber\-specialist role and into one of 
partnering with not just with a few executives, but the entire 
C\-suite. These collaborations have never been more critical.Forty\-two percent of senior executives say cyber breaches 
of their systems have increased since 2020\. Executives and 
boards should ask again and again, Are we affected?
and, if not, Are we vulnerable?More than a quarter had a consequential data breach in the 
past three years that cost more than $1 million. Around 10% 
suffered costs of $10 million or more, CISOs and
CFOs reported.To CFOs, the most devastating consequences when a breach 
(other than a data breach) occurred were:Downtime or disruptionsDamage to service and product qualityLost contracts and business opportunitiesLost customersCosts to recover data (not counting ransom payments)Lost customer data (if not recovered)These gut\-wrenching moments can serve as a catalyst to 
collaboration, sharpening awareness of a single breachs 
ripple effects from shop floor to boardroom and calling the 
entire C\-suite to act together.As a result, the C\-suite has renewed its resolve to do better 
on cyber and privacy. To get there, top executives are starting 
to understand the need to work as a cohesive unit the 
suite spot.At the center is the CISO, empowered by the CEO to 
advocate, collaborate, and orchestrate a better cyber future. 
Forty\-six percent of CEOs 49% at previously breached

Boards can spur better cyber reporting to improve oversightCISOCISOBoards are more engaged in cyber as 
their companies face increasing risks. 
Fifty\-four percent say their organisation 
has taken on more cyber risks as it 
pursues more digitisation, and 44% 
report an increase in cyber breaches
into their system since 2020\.They recognise the challenge of keeping 
up with cyber. Today, less than half of board respondents say 
that their board governs cyber very effectively in six areas. 
Fewer than half, for instance, say they very effectively 
understand the causes and effects of cyber risks (37%) or 
oversee the alignment of cyber risk management to business 
needs (43%). Only 9% of board respondents say that their 
board governs cyber very effectively across all areas.But the future of cyber oversight could be different. 
Corporate directors are willing to learn about cyber and 
devote time to it. They say these will help them do a better 
job governing cybersecurity in 2023:CISOInternal board training by management (47%)Increased frequency of meetings focused on cyber (47%)Improved reporting on cyber incidents, practices, and

Source: PwC 2023 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey12CISOCISOCISOPwC\|Global Digital Trust Insights 2023Message to corporate directorsCALL TO ACTION: First, allot more time to the CISO and cyber matters on your agenda. Second, 
dont settle for board reporting that doesnt give you confidence and insights that the organisation is 
managing the cyber risks related to its strategic moves. Cybersecurity is not an end state, so monitor 
how the company is making progress in its cyber posture and ability to defend against emerging 
threats. Ask to take part in exercises that help you understand your organisations cyber resilience.The new era of cyber transparencyStakeholders clamor for more information about how 
companies manage their cyber risk exposure.Regulators want visibility into cyber practices because they 
want to protect citizens from fraud and loss of privacy, help 
investors make better decisions, and prevent industry\- or 
system\-wide disruptions. India has published guidance on 
cyber incident notification required under the Information 
Technology Act. The UK Financial Reporting Council has 
issued guidance about digital security risk disclosures after it 
found that current disclosures by some FTSE 350 companies 
are not meeting investor needs and are often boilerplate 
and overly static. In addition to the rules pending with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (proposal) and the 
Cybersecurity \& Infrastructure Security Agency (law), the 
New York State Department of Financial Services is weighing 
a proposal that turns leading practices into regulatory 
requirements for covered entities.Investors are looking for consistent and comparable disclosures 
so they can put their money in companies that fit their needs. 
Cyber incidents can affect shareholder value temporarily
or permanently.Individuals know how their data and privacy are vulnerable 
to cyber breaches. Business partners want their data 
and other assets to be safe. These stakeholders want 
to understand how much they can trust in the ability ofbusinesses and entire systems to withstand increasing cyber 
threats.The C\-suite sees an upside to all this transparency. Four\-
fifths of senior executives in our survey agree that mandatory 
disclosure of cyber incidents, with comparable and consistent 
formats, is necessary to gain stakeholder confidence and trust.But fewer than 10% are confident that their enterprise can 
comply. More than half are not confident that they:Can provide required information about a material orsignificant incident within the required reporting period 
after the incident (58% not confident)Can assess the materiality of a cyber incident for purposesof reporting (58%)Can describe the relevant cyber expertise on the board forpurposes of reporting (59%)Have a policy stating which information can or cannot bedisclosed regarding cyber incidents (60%)Can provide information about third\-party riskmanagement (63%)Theres a transformation happening here. 
Information security is being seen as an 
enterprise capability, not just a technical 
capability Ian Schneller, CISO, Health Care 
Service CorporationCALL TO ACTION: CISOs can position their teams to work with the CFO, general counsel and other 
senior executives to prepare to translate strategy and practices into an accurate, cohesive and 
compelling narrative on the companys cyber risk management practices. The new era of cyber 
transparency means that CISOs should become adept at presenting information in a way that the board, 
senior management and investors can understand and act upon. It requires a communication strategy 
thats different from the everyday jargon of cybersecurity.PwC\|Global Digital Trust Insights 202313

environment before security is in place, or lift and shift 
existing systems into the cloud with plans to secure them later.These personnel may sidestep the CISO to avoid the 
methodical, security\-first approach the CISO would almost 
certainly advise. In the fast\-paced digital world, the
business side knows, enterprises need speed to achieve
their objectives. When agility and speed are the goals, who 
needs brakes?But cohesive governance is key, especially in a multi\-cloud 
environment where each cloud service provider has different 
security abilities and requirements. Frequent releases of new 
features and updates means that, like the clouds in the sky, 
your enterprise cloud environment is continually changing.In 2023, its time to design an overarching security 
architecture that includes all the cloud platforms your 
enterprise is using.Bring together all your enterprise security controls so you
can secure them from one location, and with as much 
automation as possible.Build infrastructure\-as\-code (IaC) and DevSecOps tooling
to automatically set the right security checks on all your
cloud platforms.CISOs might provide developers with cloud security services 
that are easy to use and conform to the organisations 
security policies. Building an encryption API for developer 
use, for instance, can help speed an applications time to 
market as well as confirm that encryption uses company\-
approved protocols.Message to CIOs and CTOsForm alliances with your CISO and DevSecOps team.
Adopt the shift left paradigm and start putting in place 
cloud security mechanisms before cloud use begins or,
if its too late for that, as soon as possible.Fast development and strong controls can go hand\-in\-hand.
Leading companies design and administer controls that 
operate not at the sluggish pace often associated with 
oversight, but at the quick and agile speed of DevOps.
In these organisations, everyone wins.CALL TO ACTION: To secure your back\-end, front\-

the CISO to lock down your cloud environments.PwC\|Global Digital Trust Insights 202315

workforce has the needed digital skills, or that they have 
invested enough, to prevent cyber attacks from disrupting 
their supply chain.And they worry that their ability to control these threats rests 
partly in the hands of third parties that are ill\-equipped to

fully mitigated the risks associated with the convergence of OT 
and IT or the risks from increased use of Internet of Things.Another area of concern to COOs and CROs is operational 
technology (OT) security. As OT technologies and solutions 
grow more sophisticated using artificial intelligence and 
machine learning to increase automation in manufacturing 
plants, for instance organisations are struggling to keep up 
with making their operations secure and safe.Not only CROs and COOs see these challenges. CISOs and 
CIOs are aware of them, too. Between them, however, lie 
differences in what each views as the greatest hindrance to 
modern and fully secure operations.Both groups say having inadequate tech solutions is atop hindrance to improving OT. They also want solutions 
that specifically address OT security.But for CISOsCIOs, the number\-one obstacle comes 
from using outdated software and vulnerability\-
management tools. Altogether, 27%, including CROs, say 
this is a problem.At the same time, CROsCOOs think a more expansiveapproach to OT cyber risk is in order one that considers 
not only business and financial risks but also health, 
safety and environmental risks. That these concerns arent 
getting equal consideration plays the number\-one role in 
hampering OT improvements, they say.There are risks on the horizon that need our 
attention. Some risks remain the same, but 
others are growing. Third\- and fourth\-party

C\-suite collaborationWeve selected three of the cyber event types most concerning 
to senior executives.Although the tactics and techniques in these scenarios might 
require technical expertise to understand, this much should 
be clear: the consequences of each spill over to areas that 
executives in operations, finance, data, and enterprise risk 
management need to address.The call to action for each C\-suite executive isnt intended to be 
prescriptive. Instead it illustrates the various angles that might 
need to be addressed for a full and lasting response to cyber 
attack. In cyber, a disengaged executive is a point of failure.29PwC\|Global Digital Trust Insights 2023Braced and ready for different scenariosHow will the scenarios organisations face in 2023 test senior 
executives ability to work together amid crises and avoid 
business disruptions?Catastrophic cyber attack is the nearly unanimous number\-
one concern. Only CFOs ranked it second, after global 
recession and alongside worries about another health crisis 
such as a COVID\-19 resurgence.These scenarios require the C\-suite to work together, but 
cybersecurity may be the only problem that requires all hands 
on deck to resolve and one over which an organisation 
arguably has some control.Two\-thirds of executives consider cybercriminals to be the 
most significant threat actor to their organisation in the 
coming year. Cyber attacks are a thriving business and make 
lucrative careers for cybercriminals.Cybercrime\-as\-a\-service and off\-the\-shelf tools allow criminals 
to perpetrate and orchestrate a variety of profitable attacks. 
Ransomware operations, for instance, now run as businesses 
with the main operator leasing the ransomware from affiliates. 
Cybercriminals can then deploy leased ransomware large\-scale 
across multiple targets.Starting in 2021, the PwC Threat Intelligence group also 
saw more commercial quartermasters, or companies selling 
cybercrime tools such as spyware, zero\-day exploits, and 
other types of malware to more customers in many countries.These global operations make it easier to get started in a life 
of cybercrime: no longer do threat actors need to develop 
their own malware. At the same time, distributed malware 
makes identifying the culprits more difficult.These commercially available tools are effective against a wide 
array of targets including, perhaps, government officials and 
private sector executives. Organisations that have deemed 
these types of threats outside their realm need to think again.Cyber tops a broad array of perceived threats% who rank these in their top five scenariosA catastrophic cyber attack50%Global recession45%A resurgence of COVID\-19
