Many organizations have welcomed this new reality, but theyvestruggled to keep their security defenses in step with the fast pace of digital growthand an expanding attack surface.Cybercriminals, however, havent had any problem staying current with a digital\-rst, cloud\-rst environment. As they quickly pivot to next\-generation tactics forexltrating data and access, security operations (SecOps) teams are falling fartherbehind while exposure to cyberattacks like ransomware is at an all\-time high.Some Background Before You Dig InAfter the release of our last Ransomware Defense Report in September 2022,ransomware attacks showed some promising signs of slowing down. Criminalstested other tactics and government agencies cracked down, with the number ofattacks leveling off by the end of year. But that glimmer of hope zzled quickly,with attackers picking up the pace so fast in 2023 that were headed toward theLast year, we foundthat organizations werelosing ground and feltless condent abouttheir defenses thanbefore.

At least one new ransomware group with double\-extortionabilities surfaced every month last year, while the average cost of a ransomwareattack escalated to $5\.13 million surpassing the average cost of a data breach.And one thing hasnt changed: ransomware is one of the toughest cybersecuritychallenges organizations of all sizes and industries continue to face. In SpyClouds2023 Malware and Readiness Defense Report, security leaders and practitionersranked ransomware as the top threat to their organizations security.3WHAT TO EXPECT INTHIS YEARS REPORTWHY WE DO THIS SURVEYAs we note in our findings, ransomware defenses are not keeping pace with cybercriminals. We do this survey to shinea light on one of the contributing causes: an emerging threat that could be an early warning sign of a ransomware event information\-stealing malware, or infostealers.Criminals are using infostealers to siphon authentication data including logs with information that enable access toenterprise networks and applications and selling the data to ransomware operators. And through a deep analysis ofrecaptured infostealer logs, weve uncovered that the presence of infostealer malware is related to the likelihood that acompany will experience a ransomware event in the near future.THE INFOSTEALER\-RANSOMWARE CONNECTION, BROKEN DOWNSpyCloud researchers conducted a detailed analysis using ransomware event data from ecrime.ch and our owndatabase of recaptured records from the criminal underground. Of 2,613 North American and Europeancompanies victimized by ransomware in 2023, 30% had at least one infostealer infection prior to being attacked.Our analysis also showed that the presence of specic infostealer infections Raccoon, Vidar, and Redline increases the probability that a company will experience a ransomware event.THE MOST PREVALENT INFOSTEALER FAMILIES ASSOCIATED WITH RANSOMWAREVICTIM COMPANIESCompanies with Raccoon, Vidar, and Redline infostealers experienced a ransomwareevent within an average of 16 weeks post\-infectionData reflect a sample of 400 companies known to have experienced a ransomware event in 202376%

Data is current as of October 20, 2023\.5SPYCLOUD RANSOMWARE DEFENSE REPORTMany organizations fail to fully remediate infostealer and other malware infections, focusing primarily on protecting theinfected device and skipping critical remediation of exposed credentials and active session data, leaving them exposed tofollow\-on attacks. In addition to presenting survey results in this report, we offer insights about how comprehensivePost\-Infection Remediation can help prevent ransomware attacks and ultimately enable security teams to get aheadof attackers.About the SpyCloud Ransomware ReportSince 2021, SpyCloud has gathered insights from security leaders and practitioners about ransomwares impact on theirorganizations and their defensive practices. In this third year of the report, we continue to analyze the trends related tothe evolution of this costly cyber threat.We surveyed 316 individuals in active cybersecurity roles within organizations in the US, Canada, and the UK with at least500 employees. We asked them about:123TOP CONCERNSabout ransomwarefor their business,THE MOST COMMONdefenses theirorganizations have inKEY GAPSthat may be leavingtheir organizationsincluding financial impactplace or on their roadmapexposedThe report also provides insights into next\-generation strategies that support a more complete remediation cycle.

We found a drop in the number of organizations affected byransomware and in the number paying ransom compared to the previous year. Thislikely reflects the temporary slowdown of ransomware activity in the later part of2022 before things ramped up again in the rst half of 2023\. Overall, however,impact from ransomware remains high, with 81% of surveyed organizationsaffected at least once in the past 12 months, and 48% of those that wereimpacted paying a ransom. Only 12% of those affected said the cumulative costover 12 months was negligible, and for 39%, the cost was at least $1 million. Theimpact, however, is much broader than nancial losses. Ransomware also disruptsoperations, damages organizational reputation, and drains SecOps resources andthe implications go on and on.$8SPYCLOUD RANSOMWARE DEFENSE REPORTSurvey participants ranked phishing and social engineering as the riskiest entry pointspoints but will need to keep pivoting to combat new attack vectors.for ransomware attacks again this year. With human behavior an ongoing issue,22\.

The majority ofhuman\-driven risks.As teams rely more heavily on tooling, they agree that automated workflows wouldsignicantly improve their ransomware defenses and overall security posture. This isrespondents ranked data backup and endpoint device protection as primarymechanisms for defense, but those countermeasures are insufficient ascybercriminals increasingly target unmanaged devices and steal authentication datathat allows them to impersonate users and gain access to organizations networksand critical business applications.33\.Infostealer malware is a precursor for a ransomware event, butteams aren't worried about it and they arent prioritizing malwareremediation.Organizations are optimistic about their ransomware prevention capabilities, with 79%of surveyed security professionals expressing general condence in their ability toprevent a full\-blown ransomware incident. But their optimism may be misplaced, sinceonly 19% of organizations are prioritizing improved visibility and remediation ofexposed credentials and malware\-exltrated data. Additionally, respondents rankedmonitoring for compromised web session cookies and tokens as the third leastimportant countermeasure. With infostealer malware infections preceding more nearlyone\-third of ransomware attacks this year, these findings tell us that manyorganizations post\-infection remediation efforts are leaving the door wide open forfollow\-on attacks.9SPYCLOUD RANSOMWARE DEFENSE REPORTTHE SHIFTING RANSOMWARE TRENDSAs we noted, ransomware took a roller\-coaster ride in the past 12 months. Some industry research showed a positivetrend for 2022, with the number of attacks leveling off or even decreasing, and ransomware revenue dropping 40%. Butthe reprieve was temporary. During the second quarter of 2023, ransomware attacks skyrocketed and ransomwarepayments approached record levels by June.SpyClouds survey reflects these shifting trends. Although some of our indicators moved in a positive direction, upondigging in, we found a bleaker picture than appears on the surface.On the Positive Side, We Saw Fewer Organizations AffectedFirst, the positive news. We found a slight decline in the number of organizations affected at least once by ransomwarein the past 12 months: 81% in this years survey vs. 90% last year. Additionally, we saw a year\-over\-year drop in thenumber of organizations affected at least once or multiple times (Figure 3\). It's important to note that 'affected' doesn'tnecessarily mean a business was impacted by a successful ransomware event; rather, that they were impacted to somedegree that required business resources.PAST FREQUENCY OF RANSOMWARE INCIDENTS (Y\-o\-Y)3e

Even when victims choose not to pay, they still see nanciallosses that go far beyond the ransom. Fewer than 12% of our surveyed organizations that were hit described their costsas negligible.

It affectsbusiness operations by hoarding resources across the organization, ofteninvolving a minimum of seven internal departments, and can quickly resultin damaged brand reputation or loss of business.

Simply put, traditional malwareremediation processes stop short of complete Post\-Infection Remediation,keeping the door open for attackers to come back by leaving that stolendata out for the taking and available to use until its invalidated.SpyClouds Malware Readiness and Defense Report, released earlier thisyear, found that 92% of security leaders and practitioners are extremely orsignicantly concerned about malware\-stolen data leading to futureattacks. Unfortunately, it also revealed that incident response today oftenlacks the crucial steps to negate the consequences of that exposed data and, as we uncovered in this survey, its still much the same.monitor and mimic user behaviorTo prevent ransomware attacks and protect business operations, SecOpspatternsteams must remediate applications and users compromised by malwareinfections. A machine\-centric process of isolating and reimaging theinfected device only cuts the connection to the malicious intruder. It doesntaddress the stolen credentials, cookies, and other authentication datamaking its way to darknet markets, where it can be leveraged by initialaccess brokers selling guaranteed access to ransomware gangs.16THE IMPLICATIONS OFEMERGING NEXT\-GENACCOUNT TAKEOVERLast year alone, SpyCloudresearchers recaptured 22 billionstolen cookie records, whichindicates criminals are shiftingtactics to steal, buy, and trade thishighly accurate and highly valuabledata minimizing their need forlarger breach datasets that may beclouded with old, outdated, and fortheir purposes, somewhat uselessdata.For ransomware attackers, sessionhijacking is a highly successfultactic, yielding much better return oninvestment and we expect to see itbecome mainstream as a wayaround passwordless technologies(like passkeys).BATTLING RANSOMWARE ON
MULTIPLE FRONTSPhishing and social engineering, along with unpatched vulnerabilities, once againranked as the riskiest entry points for ransomware (Figure 11\). This was expected,since ransomware is often preceded by human behavior that results in a malwareinfection, which can then enable a ransomware attack. Similarly, respondents to ourmalware defense survey identied phishing and spear\-phishing as the secondgreatest threat to their organizations security overall, with ransomware as the topthreat.PERCEIVED RISK OF ENTRY POINTS FOR RANSOMWARE

1We were surprised, however, to see stolen cookiestokens rated as the least riskyentry point, suggesting that understanding of this new threat is just beginning. Thisentry point is an especially high risk in passwordless environments, which manyview as the future of authentication. While passkeys are a tremendousimprovement over passwords, cybercriminals are simply working aroundpasswordless authentication with session hijacking attacks.17 
The bottom line is that each of these entry points is risky, but together theyre aforce multiplier. This means teams must focus on all of them, including third\-party,unmanaged, and undermanaged devices, and weak APIs. The use of unmanaged,undermanaged, and third\-party devices, for instance, has exploded in thedigital\-rst environment, yet they create blind spots for security teams. Likewise,the use of APIs has skyrocketed in recent years, and many organizations dont payNot all sectors view their riskiest entryenough attention to the security implications of vulnerable and improperly designedpoints through the same lens, withsome placing higher emphasis thanthe average across all industries onrisks such as stolen cookies andunmanaged or undermanaged devices.For example:WEAK APIs are a bigger concern inretail, manufacturing, and technologyManufacturing, Technology, andHealthcare view COOKIES as riskierAPIs and stolen API keys, which are another form of access being exltrated frommalware\-infected devices.Countermeasures Misaligned with New Ransomware TacticsYear over year, data backup has remained the most important countermeasure fororganizations (Figure 12\). We highlight this as concerning because it shows thatdefenses are not adjusting to the shift in ransomware tactics.

Organizations are optimistic about their ransomware prevention capabilities, with 79%of surveyed security professionals expressing general condence in their ability toprevent a full\-blown ransomware incident. But their optimism may be misplaced, sinceonly 19% of organizations are prioritizing improved visibility and remediation ofexposed credentials and malware\-exltrated data. Additionally, respondents rankedmonitoring for compromised web session cookies and tokens as the third leastimportant countermeasure. With infostealer malware infections preceding more thana fifth of ransomware attacks this year, these findings tell us that manyorganizations post\-infection remediation efforts are leaving the door wide open forfollow\-on attacks.The importance of MFA grew signicantly year over year, which may be contributing to organizations false sense ofsecurity. Although organizations should deploy MFA as one of their critical defense layers, they must also take the stepsto identify malware\-infected employees and invalidate stolen cookies that enable authentication bypass and sessionhijacking. As stated earlier, MFA and passwordless technology such as passkeys are not sufcient xes because sessionhijacking bypasses any form of authentication.Since technology and tools are only one part of the defense equation, we also asked the security pros about theiroperational and organizational countermeasures. Most feel that they adhere well to basic hygiene practices such aspatching and applying least privilege techniques (Figure 13\). While the majority already have strategies likeransomware\-specic incident response in place, plenty of work remains to be done, with a good number of respondentsnoting they are considering or are only in the planning stages of implementing upgrades to their existing strategy.STATUS OF RANSOMWARE COUNTERMEASURESALREADY IN

This accelerated timeline illustrates how cybercriminals aremaking headwinds at a dizzying pace, underscoring the need for SecOps teams to automate remediation processes.23SPYCLOUD RANSOMWARE DEFENSE REPORT 
This authentication data, exltratedfrom devices infected by infostealers,enables cybercriminals to easilyimpersonate employees and inltratethe company.ADAPTING RANSOMWARE DEFENSES FOR
STEALTHIER ATTACKSWe found that ransomware prevention is consistently at the top of the priority list for organizations, not only across allsecurity roles but also regardless of an organizations size. So, what does proactive prevention look like in the face ofevolving threats?Ransomware is a malware problem at its core, which means that preventing ransomware attacks must start withproper and robust malware remediation. Bad actors are exploiting infected systems to exltrate data they can use to aidan attack, identify potential entry points to corporate resources, and deliver executable les.Traditional malware response, however, doesnt address the risk of the stolen data from an infected device. By the timemalware is detected and the device has been reimaged, the data is already in the hands of criminals. Some infostealerscan siphon data in mere seconds. Non\-persistent malware can vanish with little or no trace, which means teams dontknow it was ever there to begin with. SecOps workflows and processes have to evolve to include a critical addition totheir next\-gen incident response: Post\-Infection Remediation.MALWARE RESPONSE MUST INCLUDE POST\-INFECTION REMEDIATIONN

And Post\-Infection Remediation is a paradigmshift from the current machine\-centric response to a more comprehensive identity\-centric response that takes thatgrowing attack surface into greater consideration. While traditional machine\-centric remediation simply clears a device,Post\-Infection Remediation takes additional measures to reset stolen credentials and invalidate active web sessions ofexposed applications. This approach adds the necessary steps to protect an organization from additional entry points fora ransomware attack.SecOps teams cant take these extra steps without visibility into the entire attack surface to start with. Incidentresponders need to know what authentication data has been stolen, and which users and corporate applications havebeen exposed, so they can focus efforts (ideally in an automated fashion) in the right areas.Yet, as our report reveals, visibility is a universal struggle. The proliferation of unmanaged, undermanaged, andthird\-party devices perpetuates blind spots for security teams. Shadow IT and shadow data exacerbate the problembecause unsanctioned applications and data stored in them are not traditionally governed by corporate security policies.The only way for defenders to gain ground and stay a step ahead is by embracing next\-generation malware remediationpractices and this is where Post\-Infection Remediation comes in. By adding Post\-Infection Remediation to theirplaybooks, SecOps teams can greatly improve their ransomware prevention outcomes and move faster to close thedoor on attackers, all while minimizing the cross\-team resources that full\-blown incidents consume.25SPYCLOUD RANSOMWARE DEFENSE REPORT 
For years, compromised credentials(username \+ password combo) wereconsidered the highest risk forcybercrimes such as accounttakeover (ATO). Today, with access asthe new currency, session hijacking ornext\-generation ATO is emerging as anew tactic.Session hijacking originates from thetakeover (or hijack) of an activebrowser or application session usinga stolen, still\-valid authenticationcookie where the criminal appears asa veried clone of a legitimateemployee. This method goes beyondtraditional credential exposure andexpands the data criminals can nowuse to assume the access of anauthenticated user.Criminals leverage these activesessions to exltrate data, andmonitor and mimic user behaviorpatterns.FINAL THOUGHTSOur biggest takeaway from this years survey is that SecOps teams have not yet embraced a key piece of theransomware defense puzzle remediating malware\-exltrated authentication data which means that manyorganizations may be more vulnerable than they realize. With an infostealer infection as a precursor to nearly one\-thirdof ransomware events in 2023, teams can no longer ignore this rising threat.While many respondents noted feeling condent in their ability to avoid a ransomware attack in the next 12 months, theircurrent practices and future priorities dont support that optimistic outlook:Organizations view phishing and social engineering as the riskiest entry point for ransomware, and haveshifted their focus from changing behaviors through user awareness and training to technology\-drivencontrols. Yet they lack important visibility into authentication data that has been exfiltrated fromunmanaged, undermanaged, and third\-party devices, which greatly limits the impact of any new defensivemechanisms.Respondents overwhelmingly agree that better visibility of malware\-exltrated data and automatedremediation would improve their ransomware defenses and overall security posture. But they viewmonitoring for compromised cookies as one of the least important countermeasures. Theyre also leastlikely to have or implement automated workflows for remediating exposed passwords and cookies, comparedto other authentication practices.Ransomware prevention is the biggest priority for security leaders and practitioners alike. However,without complete malware remediation, any prevention efforts will remain limited.As workplaces continue to digitally transform and organizations adapt how they do business, human behavior continuesto add to a sprawling attack surface. And threat actors are paying attention. Theyre modifying their TTPs for a landscapewhere access is the new currency and nding quick ways to circumvent authentication layers, from MFA to passkeys. ForSecOps teams that want to outmaneuver ransomware attackers, SpyClouds enterprise protection solution offersautomated detection of malware infections across devices and fuels remediation workflows powered by comprehensiveand actionable data.Stolen credentials via malware\-siphoned data give cybercriminals the upper hand isnt it high time to use the samedata against them? By gaining full visibility into malware infections and acting quickly, SecOps teams can truly gaincondence in their ability to keep the business safe.26SPYCLOUD RANSOMWARE DEFENSE REPORTPROTECT YOUR ENTERPRISE FROM
