2022: Cyber Criminals 
Get Even More Creative
Every year, threat actors look for new ways to outwit victims and 
bypass defenses. And 2022 was no different. As businesses rolled 
out new security controls, cyber criminals responded. 
They scaled\-up complex techniques like telephone\-oriented attack delivery 
(TOAD) and multi\-factor authentication (MFA) bypass. Unknown to most users, 
these techniques gave cyber attackers a new advantage. At their peak, TOAD 
and MFA bypass saw hundreds of thousands of attacks sent per dayubiquitous 
enough to threaten most organizations. And at the same time, proven tactics 
like brand abuse, business email compromise (BEC) and ransomware remained 
as popular as ever. With threat actors constantly upping their game, CISOs and 
Infosec teams had their work cut out.
Now in its ninth year, our annual State of the Phish report explores end\-user 
security awareness, resilience and risk across 15 countries (eight more than in 
previous years). The report benchmarks understanding of common cyber threats 
and defensive tactics and reveals how potential gaps in knowledge and cyber 
hygiene enable the real\-world attack landscape. Most attacks target people 
before they target systems. Thats why helping users build sustainable security 
habits is crucial. So, the last section of the report examines security awareness 
practices and outlines opportunities to build and reinforce a security\-aware 
culture at every level of an organization.
The report draws on surveys of 7,500 working adults and 1,050 IT security 
professionals across 15 counties. It also includes findings sourced from 135 
million simulated phishing attacks sent by our customers over a 12\-month period 
and more than 18 million emails reported by our customers end users over that 
same time period.

Security Habits and Knowledge Gaps
Last years State of the Phish described 2021 as the year of the new 
normal. The pandemic started to recede, and many workplaces 
permanently adopted a hybrid model. Those macro trends have 
continued in 2022, cementing an expanded attack surface that cyber 
criminals can target both in and out of the office. 
The increased risks of a hybrid workplace are well understood by CISOs, and 
many told us in our 2022 Voice of the CISO report that they planned to take steps 
to enhance security awareness programs to meet this challenge.
All of which begs the question: has the basic level of security awareness and 
understanding increased since last year?
Unfortunately, the short answer is no.
Terms and concepts: the same gaps remain
Common threats are still not well understood across organizations. Nearly a 
third of survey participants were unable to correctly define terms like phishing 
and malware. For more advanced attacks like ransomware, smishing (SMS 
phishing) and vishing (voice phishing) around two\-thirds answered incorrectly.
Data from the past four years shows only modest gains or no gains at all.

We saw a similar degree of improvement for more advanced email security

people have become more aware that cyber criminals can send multiple emails 
to build trust. This evolution of this tactic has been a point of focus for our threat 
researchers this year, particularly with state\-sponsored attacks.

THE UNCERTAINTY 
PRINCIPLE:
Nearly 30% of respondents said that 
they werent sure if files stored in 
the cloud are always safe. This was 
by far the highest percentage of 
not sure answers; others ranged 
between 8% and 20%. In security 
terms, not sure and dont know 
both describe a knowledge gap. 
Instead of just focusing on incorrect 
answers, training programs should 
also aim to address blind spots.
Security habits: blurred lines 
In the last four years of tracking security habits both at home and at work, weve 
seen a noticeable shift. Its now the case that over three\-quarters of people use 
their work devices for personal activities, with almost the same proportion using 
personal devices for work.

Nearly half of respondents said they allowed friends and family to use their work

because of people returning to offices for more days during the week. Most 
categories of use by friends and family remained static year on year, with email 
and messaging the most common activities.

entered manually per account. In second and third place, less\-secure browser 
password managers are still more popular than dedicated apps. While the least 
secure options are to be found in the long tail of responses, more than a quarter 
of respondents admitted to reusing a limited number of passwords.

2023 STATE OF THE PHISHREPORT
As part of our survey, we asked people why they dont take these necessary steps 
to secure their home networks. The range of answers is revealing:
Feel security is already in place (Thats what my network provider does.) 
Think there is built\-in safety ((I thought it was safe enough.) 
Never think about security (I have never thought to change any 
of these things.)
Security handled by someone they know (My spouse looks after this.)
Made security changes previously (I made changes when it was set up.)
Made some changes but not others (I have modified the ones I thought 
appropriate.)
Dont know how to change settings (I was worried I would mess it up.)
Security habits: risky business
With these gaps in knowledge and best practices, its no surprise that many 
people continue to take risky actions when faced with a cyber attack. And with 
many risky actions not being recognized in the moment (or admitted to after the 
fact), these numbers are almost certainly lower than the reality.
More than a third of respondents took at least one risky action during the 
year, with clicking on malicious links being the most frequent. With email 
overwhelmingly the most common vector for distributing phishing links and 
malware, training users on the correct action to take should remain a key part of 
ongoing security awareness initiatives.

Recognizing Risk
Cyber criminals know that most people have gaps in their security 
awareness. Their own campaign dashboards provide the evidence, 
with phishing kits, botnets and malware\-as\-a\-service often showing 
click rates, downloads and other common digital success metrics.
Despite many techniques remaining effective, attackers arent standing still. They 
have refined their social engineering tactics and introduced entirely novel attacks. 
When the threat landscape moves this quickly, security teamsand security 
awareness programsneed to be agile to keep up.
The incidence of most attack types has remained constant year on year, with high 
levels across the board. Threats arrive at an unrelenting pace and are almost as 
likely to appear from inside an organization as from an external attacker.
In total, 84% of survey respondents said that their organization had experienced at 
least one successful email\-based phishing attack during 2022\. And 54% said that 
they had dealt with three or more attacks.

TOADs and MFA phishing
This year, telephone\-oriented attack delivery (TOAD) and multi\-factor 
authentication (MFA) phishing have made waves in the threat landscape. In a 
TOAD attack, targets receive a message, often containing a fake invoice or alert. 
The message also contains a customer service number for anyone with questions. 
If the victim calls the number, they find themselves on the line with a cyber 
attacker. Our researchers have seen a range of next steps, including guiding 
victims to download malware, transfer money or enable remote access. At peak, 
we see over 600,000 TOAD messages sent per day, and the number has been 
steadily rising since the technique first appeared in 2021\.
Multi\-factor authentication (MFA) uses a second factor such as a phone or 
hardware key for added security when logging in to digital accounts. Enabling it is 
still a security best practice, but cyber attackers now have a range of methods to 
bypass MFA. While these are technically sophisticated attacks, some phishing\-as\-
a\-service providers already include MFA bypass in their off\-the\-shelf phishing kits.
Brand abuse
Social engineering is integral to most cyber attacks. Using psychological 
manipulation, threat actors unsettle victims into making mistakes, ignoring warning 
signs or trusting malicious messages. 
Social engineerings power comes from the fact that people often rely on mental 
shortcuts when making decisions. One of the clearest examples of social 
engineering is brand abuse. In these attacks, cyber criminals benefit from users 
familiarityand trustof well\-known brands. The most obvious way to take 
advantage of a brand is to use their logo or styling in a malicious message. But 
its also worth considering that in the digital workplace, malicious links hosted 
on cloud storage solutions like Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox 
are also likely to benefit from positive brand associations, as are malicious files 
created with familiar Microsoft 365 software.

2023 STATE OF THE PHISHREPORT
SIMULATING REALITY:
Microsoft was also the most 
common brand template used by 
our customers in phishing 
simulations. Half of the ten most\-
used templates were brand\-abuse 
related. And templates featuring 
familiar brands tended to have high 
failure rates.
In 2022, we observed nearly 1,600 campaigns that involved brand abuse, and the 
most abused brand in our data was Microsoft. During the year, we saw over 30 
million messages that used Microsoft branding or featured a Microsoft product 
like Office or OneDrive.
Perhaps not suprisingly, half of the 10 most\-used templates by our customers 
in phishing simulations were brand\-abuse related. Templates featuring familiar 
brands tended to have high failure rates.
Notably, 44% of working adults in our survey said that they think an email is safe 
when it contains familiar branding. And Microsoft isnt the only brand experiencing 
regular abuse, with Amazon (6\.5 million messages), DocuSign (3\.6 million 
messages), Google (2\.6 million messages), DHL (2 million messages) and Adobe 
(1\.5 million messages) all regularly impersonated.

BEC Goes Global
In our recent Cybersecurity: The 2022 Board Perspective report, global board 
members rated business email compromise (BEC) as their top concern. English is 
the most common language used in BEC attacks, but some non\-English\-speaking 
countries are starting to see higher volumes of attacks in their own languages. 
Year over year, weve seen growth in the following countries:
Globally, the average incidence of attempted BEC is 75%, and some countries do 
still fall well below this level. Japan (52%), Italy (51%), Brazil (56%), Korea (58%) 
and UAE (66%) all have BEC rates below that average. While the reason for these 
countries seeing fewer BEC attacks is unclear, there may be cultural, linguistic 
or logistical challenges that prevent attackers from effectively targeting and 
monetizing them. Or some organizations may lack visibility into the true number 
of attacks theyre facing.

Ransomware remains
BEC might be the most lucrative form of cyber attack, but ransomware can 
inflict massive operational, reputational and financial damage. About 76% 
of organizations experienced an attempted ransomware attack, with 64% 
experiencing a successful infection. Alarmingly, over two\-thirds of respondents 
said their organizations experienced multiple separate incidents of infection. 
The FBIs latest Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3\) report shows that 
ransomware attacks have continued to rise, increasing by 51% year over year. 
The Bureau recommends that organizations refrain from paying, as this only 
contributes to the threats growth.
There is also no guarantee that payment will result in a positive outcome. About 
52% of victimsslightly better odds than a coin flipregained access to their 
data after making a single ransomware payment. Nearly as many were obliged to 
make further payments, and some still never regained access to their data. Still, 
most infected organizations paid up, and many did so more than onceusually 
with the help of cyber insurance.
The overwhelming majority of organizations that faced a ransomware attack had 
cyber insurance (90%), and most of those insurers were willing to help (82%). This 
perhaps explains the high propensity to pay, with 64% of organizations infected 
with ransomware paying at least one ransoma six\-point increase from last year.

The insider threat
According to 1,400 global CISOs surveyed in our 2022 Voice of the CISO report, 
insider threats are their biggest security concern. And todays job market has 
made data protection an even bigger challenge. Pandemic\-related job mobility 
coupled with post\-pandemic economic uncertainty has resulted in large numbers 
of people changing or leaving jobs. And data shows that people often take 
sensitive data and credentials with them when they go.
In this years survey, we asked end users if they had changed jobs within the past 
two years. A quarter said that they had, and, of those who left their jobs, nearly 
half admitted to taking data with them when they left.
We also added questions about insider data loss to our survey of security 
professionals. Nearly 65% reported that their organization had experienced data 
loss because of an insider. The number was even higher for the U.S the U.K. and 
the Netherlands at around 85%.
The most common cause of data loss to insiders is the result of carelessness or 
negligence. But that isnt the only type of insider threat. In general, they fall into 
three main categories:
A careless user might cause accidental harm, such as a Japanese 
city contractor who lost a USB stick with the personal data of almost 
half a million residents. 
A malicious user takes actions for deliberate harm or personal gain, 
such as an outgoing Pfizer employee who allegedly uploaded over 
12,000 confidential files to a Google Drive account. 
A compromised user is enticed by reward or coercion to infiltrate or 
exfiltrate data, such as a former SoftBank chief accepting 400,000 to 
leak confidential information to a Russian diplomat.

Counting the cost
For most threat actors, the goal of an attack is financial. And according to our 
data, 30% of organizations that endured a successful attack experienced a direct 
monetary loss, such as a fraudulent invoice, wire transfer or payroll redirection. 
This is an increase of 76% year over year. 
The three most common consequences of attack were data breach (44%), 
ransomware infection (43%) and account compromise (36%). As all three of these 
actions can be readily monetized by cyber criminals, the financial incentives 
driving attacks are clear to see.

Benchmarks: Failure Rates, 
Reporting and Resilience
In addition to surveys and threat research, State of the Phish also 
compiles data from our phishing simulation tool to help identify 
areas of risk and areas for improvement.
The first headline to note is that users continue to display a major vulnerability to, 
well, headlines. Trending topics from news or social media are often engaging 
and can cause people to ignore red flags. Beyond regularly targeting seasonal 
events like holidays and the tax deadline, threat actors moved quickly to adopt 
the COVID\-19 pandemic as a favored lure subject. Cyber criminals are nimble 
and opportunisticso security awareness programs should use real\-world threat 
intelligence and be modelled on real\-world lures. Our researchers even saw a 
campaign making use of the death of Queen Elizabeth II to distribute malware.
Template failure rates
Attackers are adaptive, so phishing simulations should cover a range of templates 
and themes to reflect the current landscape. In real\-world terms, attacks using 
unsafe URL links are between three to fourtimes as common as those containing 
attachments. So the current ratio of link and attachment templates needs 
rebalancing. Especially as attachments still have an appreciably higher failure rate 
than links (though this has fallen by 4% since last year).

Failure rates by department
Attackers are known to comb LinkedIn and other sources to find 
targets in departments with access to financial information and 
intellectual property. So, measuring failure rates by department is 
crucial to identifying and mitigating that risk.
Among our customers, three\-quarters of departments were involved in 474 
campaigns, receiving 6,000 messages or more in 2022 with almost 800 different 
templates. This is a substantial increase over 2021 usage. Unfortunately, the 
worst\-performing functions were some of the most valuable: development, R\&D, 
supply chain, legal and managerial groups shared the highest failure rates. 
Between them, these groups have access to valuable IP, contracts, invoicing and 
high\-level credentials.

Template effectiveness
As weve seen, newsworthy topics are highly effective, both as real\-
world threats and simulation templates. Among the 10 most\-used 
template themes in 2022, the failure rate for a COVID\-19 lure was 
more than 50% higher than the next closest theme. 
COVID\-19 was also represented twice in our list of trickiest themesthose with 
the highest failure rate regardless of how many times the template was used. 
Corporate internal communicationsHR comms also appeared on the list multiple 
times. This suggests that employees are particularly vulnerable to messages 
alluding to disciplinary or other work\-related issues that raise anxiety and reduce 
attention. Also surprising was peoples tendency to fall for entertainment\-themed 
attacks, where messages related to personal interests in sport or television 
landed in their corporate inbox. This perhaps reflects the reality of how often work 
email is used to sign up for personal accounts.

2023 STATE OF THE PHISHREPORT
Most of the simulated campaigns our customers ran used two or three templates, 
with the average being 2\.4\. This is slightly higher than last year. Threat actors 
change their email lures from day to day, so using more templates reduces the 
chance of a simulation becoming widely discussed and increases the accuracy of 
the test.

Reporting and resilience
Reporting suspicious email is key to both defending against cyber 
attacks and to evaluating the effectiveness of an organizations 
security awareness efforts. 
Overall, reporting rates for simulated phishing increased to 17% (vs. 15% in 
2021\). Failure rates for attacks remained at 10%. From these two numbers, 
we calculate a resilience factor, which provides a quick way to gauge how 
resistant industries and departments are to attack. Note: the failure rates 
below are a subset of totals used previously, limited to customers who use 
our PhishAlarm in\-client reporting tool.
Last year the average resilience factor was 1\.5, meaning that people have become 
slightly better at reporting and resisting attacks. This is reflected across all three 
template types:

At industry level, there is a broad span of resilience scores, ranging from 3\.4 
in legal to 0\.9 in education. While the relatively strong performance of high\-
stakes industries like financial services and energy is heartening, several critical 
pieces of infrastructure fall below average, including agriculture, healthcare 
and transportation. As ransomware attacks on healthcare services over the 
past few years have shown, the consequences of low cyber resilience in these 
organizations can be severe.

Our PhishAlarm button is ultimately designed to let users report suspicious real\-
world messages, not just phishing simulations. Beyond giving security teams a 
way to measure user response, user\-reported emails are one of the signals that 
power our threat detection engines. In fact, we blocked an additional 75 million 
malicious messages in 2022 based on intelligence from user\-reported attacks. 
Between them, those malicious messages contained:
Of course, not every reported email turns out to be malicious. So we also

Security Awareness: Insights 
and Opportunities
The majority of organizations covered by our surveys have security 
awareness programs. But most struggle to make them effective. 
In fact, 27% of respondents said that failure rates had remained the same, even 
after introducing training. This is a big untapped opportunity. Time is already 
being dedicated to training, and, with a few key improvements, resilience and 
awareness could increase significantly.
Almost every organization offers a training program of some sort, with 74% 
conducting formal security awareness training. So far, so good. But only 56% 
train everyone in the organizationa figure which hasnt improved much since 
last year. And while training is the foundation of security awareness, it can only 
do so much. 
As weve seen, the threat landscape moves fast. Threat actors are always 
innovating. An effective way to assess user vulnerability to new threats in a 
secure environment is to use phishing simulations drawn from real\-world lures. 
But only 35% of organizations use simulationsdown from 41% in 2021\. Times 
are hard, and budgets are shrinking, but the cost of a breach makes skimping on 
security a risky trade.

In addition to regular, formal training, 79% of organizations offered training for 
people who fell for real\-world or simulated phishing attacks. This was a six\-
point drop from last year. Overall, time given to training was low, with 80% of 
respondents saying their organizations only offered two hours or less per year.
When it comes to training topics, malware, email\-based phishing and Wi\-Fi 
security were the most covered subjects, followed by ransomware. This aligns 
with the results of our end\-user survey, which found that malware, phishing and 
ransomware were the terms users were most likely to correctly define.
Most organizations say that they use threat intelligence to inform their training, 
though this wasnt something we found reflected in more specific questioning 
about content. And when it comes to aligning with top CISO concerns, only 23% 
of programs covered supplier risk. Likewise, only 31% cover BEC, despite this 
being the most financially damaging form of cyber crime.

Building a security culture
Finding the right balance between reinforcement and punishment is an perennial 
problem. Since last year, weve seen a few changes at both ends of the spectrum, 
with decreases in both the most lenient and the harshest actions for people who 
fail simulated or real\-world attacks.
Overall, 52% of organizations have formalized consequences in place for 
employees who interact with real or simulated attacks (55% in 2021\). And 26% 
of those who dont have such a model in place say they are considering it or 
will implement one soon. About half of organizations say they wont discipline 
employees until they have failed at least three phishing tests.

The data shows an obvious discrepancy in perception between security teams 
and end users, which possibly hints at lack of two\-way communication. To build 
a strong, sustainable security culture, security teams need to do more than just 
measure how people respond to real and simulated threats. They also must 
understand how employees feel about the companys security culture and their 
place within it.
Taken together, the conflicting views of employees and security teams suggest 
that security culture is at a crossroads. But there is a way forward. With the right 
training and threat intelligence, employees can learn to understand the threat 
landscape and the dangers it poses. With a fair and thoughtful consequence 
and reward model in place, security teams can encourage and direct employees 
to embody the right security behaviors. And with strong executive sponsorship, 
company culture can reinforce the importance of protecting people and 
defending data.

Conclusions
As always, there is a lot to digest in this years State of the Phish. 
And, even as weve tried to give benchmarks and show trends, the 
reality is that every company faces unique risks. Building a security 
awareness program tailored to the specific threats faced by your 
organization is a big challenge. 
But theres reason for optimism. 67% of security pros said that phishing failure 
rates have gone down since a security awareness program was implemented. 
And as our survey of end\-user awareness shows, there is plenty of low\-hanging 
fruit to push that number even higher.
Our analysis suggests three distinct approaches that can help you seize 
the opportunity.
Reduce complexity by asking the right questions
 Who in my organization is being attacked?
 Where are the current defensive gaps?
 What are my priorities to mitigate human risk?
Pair threat intelligence with organization\-wide security awareness education
 Identify which users are most likely to be targeted and who is 
most likely to succumb.
 Match education, including phishing simulation and training, to 
threats currently circulating.
 Tailor training and assessment for most attacked users based on 
the threats targeting them.
Build a security culture that goes beyond training
 Training is crucial but not sufficient.
 A strong workplace security culture will motivate users to take 
security more seriously and help them build sustainable security 
habits that extend to their personal lives.
 Measure the behavioral metrics that matter, and respond with 
appropriate and fair remediation.
