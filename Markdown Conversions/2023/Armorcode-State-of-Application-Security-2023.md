software security program?Answer ChoicesResponse PercentageThe vendors and buying approachesThe right tools for the job make it easy to spot and fix vulnerabilities, 
decrease developer workload, speed time\-to\-production, enhance 
security posture, and automate and orchestrate for fully integrated 
security practices.The majority of respondents take a best\-of\-breed approach to tool 
selection, looking for the best vendor for any given tooling category, 
rather than opting to be a single vendor shop or build tools 
themselves.While this list is not exhaustive, it provides a solid baseline for a 
mature AppSec program.Which of the following security vendors are you using in your 
software security program?AnswerkChoicesResponsesAnswerkChoicesResponsesWhere do we deploy?Shifted to the cloud or running in data 
centers? In 2023, more organizations than 
ever are running most of their workloads in 
the cloud. However, on\-premises is still a 
major force and something organizations 
cant ignore from a security perspective.Where do you deploy applications 
today?Answer ChoicesReskonses %More than half 
of respondents 
deploy 75% or 
more of their 
applications in 
the cloud, and 
a quarter run 
full cloud.AppSec prioritizationWhats the most important focus of your AppSec program forthe 12 months?For most organizations, visibility of application security posture andautomation of critical application security workflows will be the mainfocus for the year. While securing the software supply chain (SBOM)comes in last, supply chain attacks continue to rise, increasing riskin this key area.Challenges in runninga successful AppSec programYoure working on culling too many AppSec alerts. Youre finallyun\-siloing systems and data effectively. So what are the newchallenges?Not having enough funding is a standout challenge in running asuccessful AppSec program among respondents. Other notables arein hiring, broader AppSec awareness and lack of leadership buy\-in.More than half of respondents deploy 75% or more of their applications in the cloud, and a quarter run full cloud.All about the SBOMWhile were on the topic of software supply chain risk, a Software Bill of Materials goes a long way to understanding the full extent of an applications threat surface.Generating, consuming, and leveraging SBOMs provides a far more comprehensive and fair assessment of and organizations AppSec posture.Oker 20% of respondents had no SBOM usage at allHow are you currently lekeraging SBOMs within
your organizations?Answer ChoicesResponse PercentageChallenges for AppSec on 
the groundFor AppSec teams, on the ground, the challenges faced day to dayare different.Weve learned that teams are still extremely concerned that there aretoo many vulnerabilities with not enough prioritization. Being able toanalyze and triangulate results across a variety of tools and highlightrisk priorities \- even when theyre constantly shifting \- remainsdifficult.MethodologyThis survey was run by the Purple Book Community, and wascirculated among Purple Book Community members, extendedsecurity networks, and across social media.
