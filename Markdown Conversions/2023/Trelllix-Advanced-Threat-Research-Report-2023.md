THE 
CYBERTHREAT 
REPORTJune 2023Presented byInsights Gleaned from a Global Network of Experts, Sensors, Telemetry, and IntelligenceTHE CYBERTHREAT REPORTAuthored by Trellixs Advanced Research Center, this report
(1\) highlights insights, intelligence, and guidance gleaned from
multiple sources of critical data on cybersecurity threats, and
(2\) develops expert, rational, and reasonable interpretations of
this data to inform and enable best practices in cyber defense.
This edition focuses on data and insights captured between
January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2023\.Cyberthreats continue to evolve and multiply.
At speed and at scale.As SecOps teams race to defend information, 
assets, and operations, no single one of them has 
a full and complete view of the threat landscape.Why? Gaining perspective requires a broad 
horizon. Multiple sources. Streams of data. Raw 
intelligence. Massive volumes of telemetry.Real insight requires a strategic view across many 
organizations and industries. And regions. And 
attack surfaces.Welcome to the June 2023 edition of
The CyberThreat Report.22The CyberThreat Report, June 2023UNDERSTANDING THE RISKS, THREATS, AND VULNERABILITIES 
ATTACKERS ARE TARGETING AND ACTIVELY HUNTING THEMI spend a great deal of time speaking with board members, CEOs, 
CISOs, CIOs, CTOs, and other leaders responsible for the cyber defense 
of nations, governmental agencies, and private sector organizations 
across industries.We cover a wide range of topics from global research, innovation, 
and intelligence to their SecOps teams latest cyber defense practices. 
We talk about their challenges, as Trellix recently documented in 
our Mind of the CISO thought leadership e.g too many different 
sources of information (35%), changing regulatory mandates and legal 
requirements (35%), growing attack surfaces (34%), a shortage of skilled 
staff (34%), and a lack of buy\-in and use from other parts
of the company (31%).1Almost every one of these interactions, directly or implicitly, addresses 
the nature of the threat environment. What kinds of attacks are 
unfolding? What are the most impactful ransomware groups?
Which vulnerabilities are targeted? Which nation\-states appear
to be most active? What threat trends are we tracking in email and 
network security?As a board member, CEO, CISO, CIO, CTO, or SecOps 
team member, this knowledge shared in this report 
and across Trellixs rich library of guidance, information 
and perspectives is often critical to your mission.At Trellix, we have a lot to share, because we are on the frontlines every 
day. Were tapping into a massive reservoir of security intelligence, 
insights, and data gleaned from more than one billion sensors 
worldwide. As a board member, CEO, CISO, CIO, CTO, or SecOps
team member, this knowledge shared in this report and across Trellixs 
rich library of guidance, information and perspectives is often critical 
to your mission.My colleague John Fokker, who leads the threat intelligence practice 
within Trellixs elite Advanced Research Center team, has compiled 
an excellent report here. Use these insights to help focus your team, 
tighten your processes, and get the right XDR technologies in place. 
And let us know where we can focus in future editions to help keep 
your organization safe, secure, and thriving.Joseph (Yossi) Tal
SVP, HEAD OF TRELLIX ADVANCED RESEARCH CENTER3The CyberThreat Report, June 2023IN SUPPORT OF CYBERSECURITYS FRONTLINE HEROESI work with heroes.Im not referring to my team, though theyve been 
viewed as having superpowers throughout their various public and 
private sector careers.Im referring to you.Im talking about the people and teams worldwide 
who rely on Trellixs advanced research capabilities our systems, 
insights, and intelligence to protect your organizations from 
cyberattacks.CISOs, CTOs and CIOs, yes, as well as our colleagues 
at agencies like Europol, the FBI and NSA, the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Australias Cyber Security Centre 
(ACSC), and the United Kingdoms National Cyber Security Centre 
(NCSC\-UK).Just as importantly and perhaps even more so Im talking 
about every member of your SecOps team.As you know intimately from your work every 
day, cybersecurity is evolving remarkably quickly. 
Breakthroughs in technology and a powerful
shift toward XDR.What do you think are game changers for your SecOps mission?
According to the Trellix report my colleague Yossi mentioned above, 
cybersecurity leaders around the globe shared their point of view on 
these.They included better visibility (44%), stronger prioritization of what 
matters (42%), broader collaboration to address multi\-vector attacks 
(40%), and improved accuracy (37%).2Every one of these factors relies fundamentally on accurate insights, 
information, and data like the contents of this report.As you know intimately from your work every day, cybersecurity is 
evolving remarkably quickly.Breakthroughs in technology and a 
powerful shift toward XDR.Shifts in regulation, from laws to liability.
Changes in the threat environment. Theres a revolution under way, a 
transformation in how SecOps teams can stay one step ahead of the 
next generation in cyberattacks.Winning always starts with insights, 
with an understanding of our current state.Were in this together.Trellix has your back.This report is for you.John Fokker

CENTER \& TRELLIXINTRODUCTIONStrategic Context: An Unsettled WorldInterpreting the data in this report requires understanding the bigger 
picture on a global scale. Thats because cyberthreats to organizations 
worldwide dont occur in a technical vacuum. Among the major drivers 
of cyber risk are wars and other forces majeures, large\-scale shifts 
in economic cycles, and new vulnerabilities that can emerge any 
time a team introduces changes to factors such as business models, 
key partners, core processes, technology adoption, and regulatory 
compliance. A sampling of factors influencing our Q1 2023 threat data 
includes:Russias Invasion of Ukraine and Asymmetric Warfare Against the
West: Cyberactivity for the purposes of espionage, warfare, and
disinformation in service of political, economic, and territorial
ambitions from major nation\-states continues to escalate. Hackers
are levying increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks against Western
businesses, governments, and infrastructure.Xi Jinpings Consolidated Control over China and its Geopolitical
Aspirations: Chinas nationalist goals, assertive foreign policy, and
corporate espionage practices continue to drive cyber risks as
China\-affiliated advanced persistent threat (APT) groups dominate
the global landscape.Developing Economies and Rapid Infrastructure Expansion: As many
developing regions scale up infrastructure and technology as their
economies grow, cybersecurity is often not top\-of\-mind leading to
many cyber\-related vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure.Global Inflation and its Economic and Political Impacts: This quarter
included market volatility, financial and political crises, and pressures
on spending priorities and cybersecurity budgets.Continued Post\-COVID Supply Chain Disruptions: New paths to
market across regions required shifts in partners, transportation
networks, information sharing, and by extension cyber risk.
Because cyberthreats are impacting the supply chain daily, the need
for zero\-trust capabilities remains strong across industries.The Myth of Apples Superior Security Environment: This persists 
despite the fact MacOS environments can no longer be considered
safe as threat actors start to leverage Golang\-based malware
at scale and broaden attack vectors to cover numerous operating 
systems.5The CyberThreat Report, June 2023Artificial Intelligence Arrives on the Worlds Stage, Promising 
Disruption: Cyber defense is helped and hurt by enhanced machine
learning, natural language processing, and other advances. As
global cyberthreats are evolving and occurring at a scale far faster
than human teams can manage, artificial intelligence solutions
become vital for enterprise cyber defense.INTRODUCTIONQ1 2023 HIGHLIGHTS

influenced by in\-house factors, many of 
which reflect ongoing headwinds confronting 
cybersecurity leaders and frontline teams.Outdated Technology: Many organizations
continue to rely on legacy technology like
SOAR and SIEM. In fact, 96% of CISOs
say they need better solutions to protect
their entity from cyber threats.3Sea of Security Tools: SecOps teams
are flooded with alerts and lack what
they need to prioritize their time. On
average, organizations employ a confusing
array of 25 security solutions and tools.4Alert Fatigue: Inundated with alerts, SecOps
teams struggle with prioritization, false
positive, and missed alerts. According
to IDC, 35% ignore alerts perhaps, in part,
because 45% are false positives.5Insufficient Resources: With limited SecOps
resources and expertise, its hard to counter
threats effectively. Whats the average SOC
analyst tenure? Approximately two years.6Methodology: How We Gather and Analyze DataTrellixs world\-class experts from our Advanced Research Center 
gather the statistics, trends, and insights that comprise this report from 
a wide range of global sources, both captive and open. The aggregated 
data is fed into our Insights and ATLAS platforms. Leveraging machine 
learning, automation, and human acuity, the team cycles through an 
intensive, integrated, and iterative set of processes normalizing the 
data, analyzing the information, and developing insights meaningful 
to cybersecurity leaders and SecOps teams on the frontlines of 
cybersecurity worldwide. For a more detailed description of our 
methodology, please see the end of this report.6The CyberThreat Report, June 2023INTRODUCTIONQ1 2023 HIGHLIGHTS

CENTER \& TRELLIXApplication: How to Use This InformationIts imperative that any Industry\-leading assessment team 
understands, acknowledges and, where possible, mitigates the effect 
of bias the natural, embedded, or invisible inclinationto accept, 
reject, or manipulate facts and their meaning. The same precept 
holds true for consumers of the content.Unlike a highly structured, control\-base mathematical test or 
experiment, this report is inherently a sample of convenience 
a non\-probability type of study often used in medical, healthcare, 
psychology, and sociology testing that makes use of data that is 
available and accessible.In short, our findings here are based on what we can observe and,
pointedly, do not include evidence of threats, attacks, or tactics
that evaded detection, reporting, and data capture.In the absence of complete information or perfect visibility,
this is the type of study best suited to this reports objective: to
identify known sources of critical data on cybersecurity threats
and develop rational, expert, and ethical interpretations of this
data that inform and enable best practices in cyber defense.Central to this investigative ethic is the following:A Snapshot in Time: Nobody has access to all the logs of all
the systems connected to the internet, not all security incidents
are reported, and not all victims are extorted and included in
the leak sites. However, tracking what we can leads to a better
understanding of the various threats, while reducing analytical
and investigative blind spots.False Positives and False Negatives: Among the high\-performance
technical characteristics of Trellixs special tracking and telemetry
systems to collect data are mechanisms, filters, and tactics that
help counter or remove false positive and negative results. These
help elevate the level of analysis and the quality of our findings.Detections, not Infections: When we talk about telemetry, we talk
about detections, not infections. A detection is recorded when
a file, URL, IP address, or other indicator is detected by one of our
products and reported back to us.Uneven Data Capture: Some data sets require careful interpretation. 
Telecommunications data, for example, includes telemetry from ISP 
clients operating in many other industries and sectors.7The CyberThreat Report, June 2023Nation\-State Attribution: Similarly, determining nation\-state
responsibility for various cyberattacks and threats can be very
difficult given the common practice among nation\-state hackers
and cybercriminals to spoof one another, or disguise malicious
activity as coming from a trusted source.The Road Ahead: Guidance and ResourcesWhat does the information contained in this report mean for 
cybersecurity heroes on the frontlines? Cybersecurity insights and 
data are only useful if they are transformed into action and result 
in lower risk, improved decision\-making, or more efficient or cost\-
effective SecOps activities. For additional guidance and resources,

CENTER \& TRELLIXQ1 2023 HIGHLIGHTS AT\-A\-GLANCEThe Ransomware LandscapeThe Ransomware Wave: Ransomware continues to be king as the
primary type of cyberattack across the globe. Socially engineered
ploys to deceive and manipulate individuals into divulging 
confidential or personal information, such as phishing, are more
prevalent than ever even as they become more sophisticated.Cuba and Play Dominate: Though we observed a decline in ransom\-related cybercriminal activity at the start of the year, the most
prevalent ransomware families in Q1 were Cuba (9%) and Play (7%).LockBit Lingers: Despite a reduction in activity two quarters in a row, 
LockBit continues to be the most aggressive ransomware in
pressuring its victims to comply with ransom demands.Magecart Group Potentially on the Rise? Public reporting indicates
this credit card theft and ecommerce scalping groups activity in
Q1 2023 increased tremendously. This threat rarely operates at the
same scale of activity as the other major nation\-state\-affiliated APTs, 
potentially indicating a re\-emergence of Magecart Group worldwide.Ransomware Tactics EvolvingMonetary Objectives: Its unsurprising that the motivations for
ransomware remain primarily financial; the insurance (20%) and
financial services (17%) sectors logged the most detections of
potential attacks.Mid\-Size Businesses Most Impacted: Evaluation of our leak site data
reveals the victims from these attacks are most commonly mid\-sized
businesses with only 51 to 200 employees (32%) and $10M to $50M inrevenue (38%).United States as Primary Target: The U.S. (15%) was the country
most affected by ransomware groups. It was also the country with
the highest percentage of corporate victims (48%) who decided to
buy their data back from the attackers a rate six times greater
than the next nation on the list, the United Kingdom.Cobalt Strike as the Weapon of Choice: Trellix telemetry identifiesthis tool as heavily favored by ransomware actors (28% of incidents).
It appears to be growing in popularity and usage amongst these
groups despite vendor Fortras attempts in late Q4 2022 to make it
harder for threat actors to use it.9The CyberThreat Report, June 2023INTRODUCTIONQ1 2023 HIGHLIGHTS

CENTER \& TRELLIXNation\-State Red FlagsLeading Actors: For the last six months, APT actors linked to China,
including Mustang Panda and UNC4191, were the most active in
targeting nation\-states in Q1\. China\-affiliated threat actorsdominated the global scene, generating 79\.3% of all nation\-state
activity, followed by actors tied to North Korea, Russia, and Iran.Most Active APT Group: Mustang Panda persisted for the third
quarter in a row as the most active APT group worldwide (72%) 
denoting Chinas continued and growing malicious cyber efforts forthe purpose of espionage and disruption.Vulnerability IntelligenceFailure to Address Known Vulnerabilities: Most of this quarters
most critical vulnerabilities consisted of known vulnerabilities not
yet addressed.Yesterdays News: For a disclosed Apple vulnerability in February of
this year, the bug had roots as far back as the FORCEDENTRY exploit,which was used by NSO Group as part of its Pegasus spyware
disclosed in 2021\.Email SecurityNew Avenues of Attack: Although Microsoft has started to block
macro attachments for the Office platform, threat actors have
quickly adopted other means of infections to continue targeting 
Windows devices such as SEO poisoning, OneNote, and
Zip attachments.Untrustworthy Brands: In addition to generic phishing emails, bad
actors are increasingly leveraging legitimate brand names
and services, like those from PayPal, Google, DWeb, and IPFS, to scam
victims and steal their online credentials.Rogue Access to the CloudA Shift in Tactics: Cloud infrastructure attacks continue to rise as
more and more businesses transition from on\-prem infrastructure to
more affordable and scalable options from Amazon, Microsoft,
Google, and others.Valid Accounts: Though more sophisticated attacks with multi\-factor authentication, proxies, and API execution are ascendant, the
dominant attack technique continues to be through valid accounts,
at more than twice the frequency of the second most used attack
vector. This emphasizes that the risk of rogue access is real, as
cybercriminals access and sell legitimate account or website loginsto infiltrate and conduct attacks.10The CyberThreat Report, June 2023REPORT ANALYSIS, INSIGHTS, AND DATASecurity IncidentsThe security incidents discussed in this section are based on public 
reports. In the first quarter of 2023, windows binaries, third\-party 
tools, custom malware, and penetration\-testing tools continued to 
impact operations as threat actors exploited paths of least resistance. 
PowerShell and the Windows Command Shell continued to be abused 
to spawn tasks leading to persistence, deployment, and extraction.TOP WINDOWS BINARIES 
USED IN Q1 2023 EVENTS1\.PowerShell2\.Windows CMD3\.Scheduled Task4\.RunDLL325\.WMICScheduling tasks, inserting malicious 
DLL files, and commands executed 
through Windows management 
instrumentation rounded out the 
top 5\. Whether executing by scripts 
or manual keyboard entry, threat 
actors continued to make use of 
the unprotected and unmonitored 
binaries already at their disposal.In many cases, third\-party tools, 
freeware, and penetration testingtools play a role in an attack lifecycle assisting threat actors in setting 
persistence, running scripts, discovering and collecting targeted 
information and escalating privileges to access assets or data that are 
otherwise inaccessible to restricted accounts. Additionally, when used 
for privilege escalation, an attacker can run installation processes 
with elevated privileges and access areas, assets, or data that are 
otherwise inaccessible to restricted accounts.INTRODUCTIONQ1 2023 HIGHLIGHTS

CENTER \& TRELLIXThe more nefarious third\-party tools such as Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, 
and Sharphound are used both legitimately and by threat actors to 
gather passwords, set beacons, or elevate privileges. Once an attacker 
compromises an environment, they can use file transfer tools such
a cURL to access remote payloads, or Rclone to exfiltrate data to
cloud storage.In the first quarter of 2023, the 
Magecart Group, APT29, and APT41 
were the three most active threat 
groups and APTs to target users by 
geolocation and sectors as methods 
to collect monetary value, uncover 
government secrets, or inhibit 
infrastructure use. We were surprised 
to discover that the Magecart Group 
topped the list as it rarely operates at 
the scale of the other major nation\-
state\-affiliated APTs. We will be 
monitoring the groups activity
in the months ahead to gauge 
whether the current periods data 
signals the groups re\-emergence on

may not have reported a breach or remain unaware of an incident.Reported events analyzed and vetted 
by our research team contain a 
wealth of information, correlations, 
or attributions of an individual 
threat actor, a threat group, or a 
more sophisticated APT. The tools, 
techniques, and procedures along with 
malware families include loader and 
downloader malware, RATs, information 
stealers, and ransomware. In the Q1 
2023 events analyzed and available via 
Insights, we determined that Ukraine 
was targeted most frequently, followed 
closely by the U.S.The Royal Ransom, Trigona, and Maui 
ransomware families were the heavy 
hitters in Q1 2023\. Trellix recently 
published a detailed analysis of Royal 
Ransom and its inner workings with 
Windows and Linux executables.
Although statistics represented

of the year, especially in January. This trend could explain the notable 
decrease in activity for both Hive and Cuba. Furthermore, the FBI and 
Europols disruption of Hives activities in late January would have 
significantly interfered with their operations. LockBit continues to be 
a major family in the ransomware space and is especially aggressive 
and seemingly successful at pushing victims to pay their ransoms.13The CyberThreat Report, June 2023INTRODUCTIONQ1 2023 HIGHLIGHTS

create a better picture of the threat landscape and help reduce 
observation bias. First, we depict the statistics extracted from the 
correlation of nation\-state groups, IoCs, and Trellix customer telemetry.
Secondly, we provide insights from various reports published by the 
security industry that are vetted, parsed, and analyzed by the Threat 
Intelligence Group.As noted above, these statistics are those of the campaigns, not 
the detections themselves. Due to various log aggregations, our 
customers use of threat simulation frameworks, and high\-level 
correlations with the threat intelligence knowledge base, the data is 
manually filtered to meet our analysis goals.We continue to see China\-affiliated threat actors dominate the global 
landscape, particularly with Mustang Panda driving a significant 
majority of detections in Q1 2023\. Since they rely heavily on sideloading 
and other techniques for stealth, its possible Chinese\-affiliated APT 
groups rotate their malware tools less frequently compared to other 
threat actors. If so, this practice could lead to projection bias or an 
inflated estimate of the detections of Chinese\-affiliated hashes.16The CyberThreat Report, June 2023INTRODUCTIONQ1 2023 HIGHLIGHTS

and vulnerability analysis continuously monitor the latest vulnerabilities 
in order to provide guidance to customers on how threat actors are 
leveraging them and how to mitigate the probability and impact of 
these attacks.One of our most critical, but unsurprising, findings for 2023s first 
quarter is many of this periods most critical vulnerabilities consisted 
of bypasses to patches for older CVEs, supply chain bugs resulting 
from the utilization of outdated libraries, or long\-patched vulnerabilities 
persisting far past their expected five minutes of fame.Consider CVE\-2022\-47966 for example, a critical (9\.8\) vulnerability in 
Zohos ManageEngine products that made the rounds this January.
ManageEngine is used by thousands of companies worldwide, so we 
werent surprised when exploitation of this vuln was detected in the 
wild. What astonished us was the root cause: utilization of Apache 
Santuario 1\.4\.1 a version nearly old enough to vote which contained a18The CyberThreat Report, June 2023known issue allowing for XML injection. Zoho patched the vulnerability 
across its suite of products in October and then, almost three months 
later in Q1, CISA released an advisory warning of in\-the\-wild exploitation 
and urging vendors to patch.Another example is CVE\-2022\-44877, a critical vulnerability in Control 
Web Panel (CWP). Although not directly related, this vulnerability has 
many of the same characteristics as our previous example: it is another 
9\.8 RCE that saw widespread active exploitation in January despite 
being patched back in October. The root cause was not exactly Black 
Hat\-talk worthy, either: command injection using standard shell variable 
expansion in a URL parameter.A third example is CVE\-2021\-21974, a vulnerability in VMware ESXis 
OpenSLP service addressed back in February 2021, almost exactly
two years before its sudden resurgence due to an in\-the\-wild 
exploitation.When we reported on this vulnerability in our February 
Bug Report, we noted around 48,000 internet\-reachable servers were 
still running vulnerable versions of ESXi according to Shodan. Today, 
that number is still over 38,000 a change of less than 22%.DateNumber of Vulnerable ESXi Servers According to ShodanLate February 2023Late April 202348,47138,047INTRODUCTIONQ1 2023 HIGHLIGHTS

CENTER \& TRELLIXWe found a few examples of our own when researching Apple devices 
earlier this year: CVE\-2023\-23530 and CVE\-2023\-23531\. These two 
vulnerabilities differ from the previous examples in that their impact is 
limited to local elevation of privilege and not RCE. This is not a reason 
to overlook their significance, however, as a very similar vulnerability 
was leveraged by the FORCEDENTRY exploit, which was used by NSO 
Group to deploy its Pegasus spyware back in 2021\. In fact, the two 
CVEs we uncovered utilize the same primitive that served as the basis 
for the FORCEDENTRY exploit: an innocuous class called NSPredicate.
Unfortunately, Apples approach to mitigating FORCEDENTRY involved 
the use of an extensive denylist to shore up the ways NSPredicate 
was being abused a mitigation which failed to address the 
underlying problem and allowed us to bypass it.It is tempting to point to trends such as these and conclude 
vendors dont take security seriously or bemoan the regurgitation 
of old exploits by threat actors and researchers, but this isnt the 
right takeaway. Vulnerability researchers engage in variant analysis 
because an effective vulnerability researcher emulates the priorities 
of real threat actors, and finding a mitigation bypass or an old CVE 
in a rarely patched product consistently produces better ROI than19The CyberThreat Report, June 2023reinventing the wheel. For organizations which rightfully recognize 
this trend, the takeaway should be this: while cutting\-edge threat 
detection technologies are irreplaceable in the modern threat 
landscape, many victories can be won on the fundamentals, such as 
patching processes and supply chain vetting.Email SecurityEmail security statistics are based on telemetry generated from 
several email security appliances deployed on customer networks 
around the world.Phishing attacks that leverage legitimate brands to scam users and 
steal their credentials are on the rise, with DWeb, IPFS, and Google 
Translate heavily utilized in email attacks. Attackers also abused 
freemail and other comparable services, such as the two applications 
PayPal Invoicing and Google Forms, to mount vishing attacks and avoid 
detection.Similarly targeted during this period were new brands like 
Scribd, LesMills, and Google Play gift cards.Furthermore, in terms of the specific malware used for these attacks, 
Formbook and Agent Tesla both saw notable increases in Q1 2023, 
compared to late last year. This may be driven by the fact both pieces 
of malware are easier to acquire and deploy, compared to Remcos, 
Emotet, and Qakbot.MOST PREVALENT EMAIL MALWARE TACTICS Q1 2023INTRODUCTIONQ1 2023 HIGHLIGHTS
