Over the last 30\-plus years, wevedeployed millions of firewalls and endpoints globally. To thisday, SonicWall has more than 1\.1 million active sensors thatreport threat information multiple times a day, providingus with rich sets of threat data. This threat intelligencecontributes to our strong security efficacy, but alsohighlights key real\-time trends in the market.Over the past year, cybercriminals faced with increasingmedia attention, heightened awareness and intensifyinglaw\-enforcement pressure began shifting away fromestablished hotspots to new areas. As a result, organizationsalready dealing with macroeconomic pressures, supply\-chain challenges and continued geopolitical strife oftenfound themselves confronted with a cyberattack.3\|2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|Introduction2022 reinforced the need for cybersecurity in everyindustry, and every facet of business, as threat actorstargeted anything and everything. For instance, while theretail and finance industries typically see lower cyberattackvolume compared with other industries, in 2022 bothverticals experienced double\-digit increases in malware,including triple\-digit increases in IoT malware attacksand cryptojacking.These trends were compounded by the fact that new tacticsare being developed with breathtaking speed. 2022 broughtgrowth in pure extortion attacks, the fall of Big Ransomware,widespread expansion to Linux and cloud targets, theadoption of powerful new languages and platforms, and thegrowing specter of AI and quantum attacks.In this volatile threat environment, preparation is morecritical than ever before. And today, being prepared meansmore than just deploying the most advanced solutions. Itmeans developing comprehensive cybersecurity strategies,based on the most current threat intelligence available.The 2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report is your guide toattackers rapidly evolving tactics. On behalf of our networkof trusted partners and the entire SonicWall team, includingour Capture Labs threat researchers, were pleased toshare these key insights on cybercrimes shifting frontlines,as well as the actionable threat intelligence you needto arm your organization against todays ever\-changingthreat environment.Bob VanKirk

Other vendors have noted a similar decline, asIn January 2022, a sampling of Dark Web cybercriminalhave U.S. government agencies.chatter published by ZDNet revealed an undercurrent ofAs Goes Russia, So Goes Ransomware
In May, U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) CybersecurityDirector Rob Joyce remarked on the decreasing ransomwarelevels. Theres probably a lot of different reasons whythat is, but I think one impact is the fallout of Russia\-Ukraine, Joyce said.With roughly two\-thirds of state\-sponsored cyberattackscoming from Russia, and 75% of money generated byransomware in 2021 going to groups highly likely to beaffiliated with Russia, anything affecting that country has anoutsized effect on cybercriminals, and in turn, cybercrime.According to Joyce, sanctions have made it harder forcybercriminals to move money and buy infrastructureneeded for attacks, making cybercriminals less effective.But while becoming less effective should result in an evendecrease across the board, whats actually being observedare huge decreases in places that generally see the mostransomware particularly the United States, whereransomware fell by nearly half.Ransomware or Bust
2021 was a banner year for ransomware busts.Cybercriminals associated with Netwalker, Egregor,Lockergoga, MegaCortex and the Trickbot malware werebrought to heel amid a flurry of headlines, and when a30\-month investigation involving INTERPOL, South Korea,Ukraine and the U.S. resulted in the arrests of the Cl0pransomware kingpins, it sent the message that the U.S. wasno longer the safe profit center it once was.fear running through the underworld. This is a big change. Ihave no desire to go to jail, one said in response to the REvilarrests. Another seemed to take them as a warning, sayingthat anybody who expected Russia to protect them wouldbe greatly disappointed. Still others worried that Dark Webadmins might reveal their identities to law enforcement.But as the risk of attacking targets in the U.S. went up,the perceived payoff dropped. Mounting cyberinsurancerequirements and the specter of mandatory reportingoffered businesses even more motivation to hardendefenses. And in 2022, the U.S. government created theVirtual Asset Exploitation Unit, increasing tracking andenforcement efforts against ransomware operators.Faced with a riskbenefit analysis no longer working intheir favor, some cybercriminals shifted targets, leading todouble\-digit ransomware increases in places like Europe andAsia. Still others are diversifying their tactics.Jack of All Trades
Unlike ransomware, which announces its presence, thrives onbranding and notoriety, and relies heavily on direct contactwith victims, cryptojacking can succeed in complete silence.And for some cybercriminals feeling the heat from increasedenforcement efforts and ongoing geopolitical conflict, aconsistent, lower\-risk income stream may be worth sacrificinga potentially higher payday.\[Cryptojacking] has a lower potential of being detected by thevictim; unsuspecting users across the world see their devicesget unaccountably slower, but its hard to tie it to criminalactivity, much less point to the source, Terry Greer\-King,SonicWall Vice President for EMEA, told Tech Monitor.5\|2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|IntroductionTop Data Breaches of 2022NAMEINDUSTRYDATEIMPACTJanuaryJanuaryJanuaryJanuary60 GB of data, including usernames and PINs

While we cant be sure yet whether this isThe Rise of Extortion Groups
An increased awareness of ransomware motivated manyorganizations to create and maintain strong backups andincident response plans, making file encryption less effectivethan it once was.In response, 2022 brought a growth in the number ofransomware groups no longer actually deploying ransomware.These attackers, referred to as extortion groups, includeboth Lapsus$ and Karakurt both of which became majorthreats without encrypting a single endpoint. By using socialengineering, vulnerability exploits, stolen credentials or othertactics, these groups gain illegal access to a target network.Then, once theyve stolen data, they threaten to leak theinformation if victims dont pay up.a sign of sustained growth, we can be sure ransomware isntgoing anywhere soon.A Lapsus in JudgmentIn early 2022, a new cybercriminal group begandominating the headlines. Calling themselvesLapsus$, they quickly became known for their brazentactics: Instead of lurking in the corners of the DarkWeb, this group actively cultivated a social mediapresence, accumulating more than 50,000 followerson Telegram. Here, they solicited input on who shouldbe targeted next, ultimately engaging in some of thebiggest big\-game hunting imaginable: Okta, Nvidia,But while these attacks involve reputational damage, data leaks,Samsung, Microsoft and others were all breached.and the risk of compliance issues and lawsuits like traditionalTo facilitate these breaches, the group publiclyransomware, theyre much harder to trace. Since theres norecruited new accomplices, offering money for insideactual ransomware involved, tracking is often conflated underinformation or assistance.malware. However, this is a distinct form of extortion and needsto be tracked by vendors despite a lack of encrypting endpoints.When Will Ransomware Rebound?
While several factors could be responsible for the dropin ransomware, there are also many signs it could soonmake a turnaround.First, it bears mentioning that we arent actually seeing any sortof widespread abandonment of ransomware. While attacks aredown 21%, 2022s ransomware volume is still much closer tothe sky\-high totals we saw in 2021 than to what we saw in 2018,2019 and 2020\.

ATTACK SIMULATIONCybercriminals Shifting from
Cobalt Strike to SliverThe practice of using legitimate system administration,forensic or security tools to conduct cyberattacks hasWhat is Sliver?
Like Cobalt Strike, Sliver is a platform designed for adversarybecome so ubiquitous that it even has a name: Living off thesimulation, but with the added benefits of being moreLand (LotL) attacks.This method is attractive because the necessary toolsare already deployed and available for threat actors,allowing them to operate without raising suspicion. Andbecause theyre legitimate toolsbinariesscripts, theyresignificantly less likely to be flagged as malicious byanti\-malware solutions. For instance, legitimate NetCat a tool used by system admins to transfer data, testand troubleshoot networks also allows threat actors tosurreptitiously enumerate internal networks with scanning,create a backdoor as a persistence mechanism, and evenexfiltrate data.In a similar fashion, threat actors have increasingly utilizedlegitimate offensive security tools such as Cobalt Strike,a commercial penetration testing tool that allows securityteams to replicate the tactics and techniques of advancedadversaries in a network. Over the past several years, theabuse of Cobalt Strike has skyrocketed, increasing by 161%between 2019 and 2020 alone.But Cobalt Strike has several strikes against it. Due to itswidespread adoption and use in high\-profile attacks such asSolarWinds, theres been an increased focus on detecting andmitigating attacks using the tool.obscure and open source. Because the framework is writtenin Golang, its cross\-platform compatible and available forMicrosoft Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems.Slivers implants supports broad command and controlpaths (C2\) over Mutual TLS (mTLS), WireGuard, HTTP(S) andDNS to evade detection, and are dynamically compiled withper\-binary asymmetric encryption keys.As it provides all the necessary capabilities for comprehensiveadversary simulation, its a worthy alternative for securityteams but these qualities also make it attractive to attackers.How Attackers Use Sliver
Sliver is generally regarded as more flexible and easier to usethan Cobalt Strike. After compromising a victims network,the attacker deploys implants (essentially Sliver payloads)inside the targets servers or endpoints, then uses Sliver forC2 interactions. Cross\-platform implants can be generated inseveral formats, including executable file, shellcode, sharedlibraryDLL file or service.These implants can be obfuscated via the garble orgobfuscate libraries, making them harder to detect. But evenwhen detected, this obfuscation can significantly increaseanalysis time while researchers have created tools that canhelp de\-obfuscate strings in payloads, according to Microsoft,Cobalt Strike is also quite expensive. At $5,900 per userit remains a fairly manual process.for a one\-year license, cybercriminals typically use olderversions that have been cracked and pirated. This tends tomake detection even easier because paying customers aregenerally running the latest version of Cobalt Strike, the useof older versions is often a breach indicator.Ever on the lookout for better ways to evade cyber defenses,attackers have recently begun to supplement or replaceCobalt Strike with a similar (but more obscure) tool, known asSliver, in their attacks.Sliver also supports the use of stagers, which are the smallerpayloads used by C2 frameworks to limit the amount of codeused in an initial payload. Stagers retrieve and launch full\-sizedbackdoors and are useful for things like phishing emails, butthey also make file\-based detection more difficult.17\|2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|Breach and Attack SimulationSliver is also highly customizable another quality attackersfind attractive. According to Microsoft, operators arent limitedWhos Using Sliver?
While Sliver was introduced in mid\-2019, its use amongto Slivers default DDL or executable payloads. Motivatedcybercriminals didnt start picking up until 2021, when itsthreat actors can generate a Sliver shellcode and embed it inadoption was spearheaded by powerful nation\-state actors.custom loaders like Bumblebee that then run the Sliver implanton a compromised system, the company said.Cozy BearThe DukesAPT29: This group is part ofRussias foreign intelligence service, the SVR, and hasOnce Sliver is deployed, it offers attackers full access to theattacked organizations in the U.SU.K Europe andtarget system, allowing it to conduct subsequent steps inthe attack chain.elsewhere. It was among the first high\-profile groups toattack using Sliver: After a July 2020 joint governmentreport on the attempted sabotage of COVID\-19 vaccinedevelopment described the groups methods in detail,it reportedly adopted Sliver as part of a larger change intactics, techniques and procedures (TTP).DEV\-0401Bronze Starlight: This China\-based APTgroup began replacing Cobalt Strike with Sliver in June2022\. Unlike other Ransomware\-as\-a\-Service (RaaS)operators, this group is involved in every stage of theattack cycle however, researchers suspect that theransomware is merely a decoy to hide its true objectives,such as intellectual property theft and espionage.Exotic Lily: What sets this group, likely based in centralor eastern Europe, apart is that it isnt known to exploitvulnerabilities instead, members pose as employeesof legitimate companies, complete with social mediaprofiles and AI\-generated photographs. Spoofed emailaccounts are then used to deliver the attack payloadwithin spearphishing emails.DEV\-0237FIN12: This RaaS affiliate group is known fordeploying a wide variety of payloads, including Hive, Ryuk,Conti and others. The group has replaced Cobalt Strikewith Sliver in its attacks, and has been observed using it inconjunction with the SystemBC RAT.TA551Shathak: This group acts as an initial accessbroker. It uses malicious macros placed in MicrosoftOffice documents that, if enabled, are capable of directlyloading the Sliver framework.To be clear, Cobalt Strike is still king, and likely will be forsome time. But as defenders and antimalware and EDRsolutions continue to improve their abilities to detect it, weexpect to continue seeing a shift to Sliver, as well as other C2frameworks such as Brute Ratel and PoshC2\.18\|2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|Breach and Attack SimulationKey Findings from 20222%21%465K139MMalware

On Nov. 15, Miller County, Ark was hit bya ransomware attack that spread through a mainframe,ultimately affecting a total of 55 counties. While no datawas stolen, more than a week later many were still unableto turn on their computers and relying on pen and paperfor daily operations. The disruption ultimately stretchedwell into December.But 2022 also proved that, should attackers ever set theirsights on disrupting governance at the national level, theycould potentially succeed. When Costa Rica was hit byransomware in April 2022, it marked the first time a countryhad ever declared a national emergency in response to acyberattack. When the country refused to pay the outlandishransom demand, the countrys import and export logisticscollapsed, endangering scores of perishable items stored inthe tropical countrys cold storage.While this attack is now believed to have been little more thana diversionary tactic (see page 39\), rather than a legitimateattempt to destabilize a nation, it provides a terrifyingproof of concept for how successful such a ransomwareattack could be.Due to better prevention and response techniques, thepercentage of people willing to pay a ransom continued todrop in 2022\. While this is a positive change, its put a squeezeon ransomware operators profits. In an attempt to recoupsome of these losses, attackers responded by increasingthe amounts demanded, pushing the average ransomwarepayment ever higher.Even for the victims that paid these princely sums, thenightmare often wasnt over: Double extortion tacticsalso increased in 2022, with one report showing a 120%year\-over\-year spike in the number of victims facingsubsequent ransom demands.More ruthless than how cybercriminals were attacking,however, was who they were attacking. Despite PR messagesfrom some ransomware groups promising not to attackhospitals and healthcare facilities, SonicWall found that theseransomware attacks grew 8% year\-over\-year, often withcatastrophic effects.In April, a healthcare conglomerate consisting of 65 hospitalsand 450 healthcare facilities across the U.S. experienced aransomware attack, incurring a staggering $100 million in lostrevenue and mitigation costs. That same month, a ransomwareattack on a medical center in Yuma, Ariz resulted in the theft ofSocial Security numbers, health insurance information, namesand medical information for more than 700,000 patients.But while SonicWall observed an increase in attacks onhealthcare in 2022, it observed a significantly larger 275%spike in attacks on education. While schools often dont havethe money to pay the large ransoms demanded of them,their networks contain a great deal of student data, whichcybercriminals can use to open credit cards or sell for a highprice on the dark web.In one particularly egregious example, attackers took advantageof the U.S.s long Labor Day weekend to launch an attack onthe Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the second\-largest school system in the country. After LAUSD refused topay the ransom demand, the threat actors published 500GB ofstolen data including Social Security numbers, bank accountinfo, W\-9 forms and sensitive student health information.37\|2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|RansomwareRansomware by IndustryAs with the regional and country data, the industry\-specificBut this double\-digit drop serves as a counterbalance to andata also showed a huge variety in outcomes.

While some ransomware groups were busy retraining theircrosshairs on new targets in 2022, others were reorganizing,rebranding or simply going inactive. The DarkSide groupkicked off this trend when it publicly announced it wasdisbanding amid an investigation into its attack on ColonialPipeline. But over the past year, weve seen the fall ofseveral other large ransomware groups, including PYSA,Conti and REvil.Following a spate of attacks on education institutionsin the U.K. and 12 U.S. states, the U.S. Cybersecurity \&Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a warningabout the PYSA group in March 2021, but it did little toslow the groups growth: One report found that attacksincreased 50% between August and November 2021, attimes surpassing even Conti. But despite being one of thetop three ransomware groups in the final months of 2021, thegroup appears to have stopped operating entirely sometimein the first half of 2022\.Conti itself also disappeared in 2022 but it chose toburn out rather than fade away. In 2021, IC3 reported thatConti was responsible for more ransomware attacks oncritical infrastructure than any other variant. The groupalso conducted a number of attacks on high\-profile targets,such as Irelands health services and Japanese electronicscompany JVCKenwood, demanding ransoms in themillions of dollars.But in 2022, amid the worsening RussiaUkraine conflict,Conti reportedly based out of Russia published a blogvowing its full support for the Russian government.

In their place, were likely to see acceleratinggrowth in the use of malicious files without any macros,such as those exploiting vulnerabilities in MS\-Office, makinguse of things like Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) fields, orrequiring a victim to click on a phishing link.58\|2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|Malicious PDFOffice FilesIoT MALWAREIoT Malware Nearly DoublesWhen IoT malware attack volume rose just 6% in 2021 after jumping 218% in 2019 and another 66% in 2020 itoffered hope that wild acceleration might be giving way toslower and more stable growth. Unfortunately, this easingwould prove temporary: In 2022, SonicWall Capture Labsthreat researchers recorded 112\.3 million instances of IoTmalware, an 87% increase over 2021\.This spike easily exceeded the previous record for IoTmalware attacks observed by SonicWall in a single year, andit also pushed the number of attacks past the 100 millionmark for the first time.Within this overall yearly record were several smallerrecords. The global attack volume for January reached 12\.54million, surpassing the previous high\-water mark by nearly2 million. And in June, attack volume soared even higher,reaching 12\.98 million. These higher\-than\-usual monthlyattack volumes pushed quarterly totals to new records, aswell. The only quarter not to set a new attack volume recordwas Q3 and it wasnt far off, at that.What is IoT Malware?IoT malware is a type of malware specifically designed to takeOnce connected, these devices can work together to performover connected, or IoT, devices.
