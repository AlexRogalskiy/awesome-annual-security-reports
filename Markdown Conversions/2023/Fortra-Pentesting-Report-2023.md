Introduction
Since penetration testing encompasses a great variety of security 
assessments, tools, and services, there is no set formula for the 
creation and maintenance of a pen testing strategy. For those 
wanting to successfully incorporate pen testing into their own 
cybersecurity program, this can present a challenge, with no clear 
place to look to as a guiding example. 
In general, cybersecurity has become tied to an organizations 
reputation, with a breach having the potential to severely damage 
their standing. Unfortunately, this can create an environment in 
which everyone is reticent to share any aspect of their security 
journey. However, knowledge sharing and analysis is a critical part 
of defining best practices and presenting a united front against 
threat actors. With over a decade of specialized experience, Fortras 
Core Security developed a penetration testing survey in order to 
get a better picture of how cybersecurity professionals are using 
penetration testing in the field, including pen testing strategies and 
the resources required to deploy a successful pen testing program. 
Now in its fourth year, this survey continues to track year\-over\-year 
changes, trends, challenges, and areas of improvement. The data 
collected provides visibility into the full spectrum of pen testings 
role, helping to determine how these services, tools, and skills 
must evolve. This year, we continue to see slight shifts in the role 
penetration testing plays in the cybersecurity landscape and identify 
how broader trends, like the global economy, can influence its role.
The results are explored in detail in this report, providing valuable 
data on the following key issues related to pen testing:
Top security concerns like ransomware, phishing, and 
misconfigurations
Testing frequency and remediation
Compliance concerns
Pen testing in different environments
In\-house pen testing team efforts and challenges
Using and selecting third\-party teams

Reasons for Pen Testing
Organizations pen test for multiple reasons, with 69% reporting they 
perform pen tests for risk assessment and remediation prioritization, 
62% for vulnerability management program support, 58% for 
compliance and external mandates, and 40% for internal or company 
specific mandates (Figure 1\). 
Risk assessment and remediation prioritization are foundational 
offensive security practices, helping identify security weaknesses in 
an IT environment and determining which have the most potential 
for harm. This provides guidance for organizations on where to 
allocate resources for mitigation. Those respondents who reported 
solely using pen testing for risk assessment and remediation 
prioritization may be relying on a more ad hoc security approach. 
However, risk assessment is a key component of any vulnerability 
management program, which is an established strategy of 
identifying, classifying, prioritizing, and remediating weaknesses 
in an IT environment. While a penetration test will always provide 
helpful insights, organizations can achieve more with a formalized 
program, in which tools can work in tandem to provide maximum 
coverage and impact.
External and internal mandates are also related to one another, in 
that they both set cybersecurity standards to which organizations 
must adhere. The key difference is that external mandates are set 
by regulatory bodies, government agencies, or some other entity 
while internal mandates are company specific. Because external 
mandates are enforceable by law and can impose fines or other 
consequences, they are typically given priority over internal 
mandates, which the data seems to suggest. However, it is still worth 
having internal mandates, as they are written with the specific needs 
of the organization in mind and often go beyond the baseline of 
cybersecurity that is set by external regulations.

Common Security Concerns
Ransomware (72%), phishing (70%), and misconfigurations (58%) 
were once again the top security concerns (Figure 2\) for survey 
respondents. According to Verizons 2022 Data Breach Investigations 
Report, there was a 13% increase in ransomware breaches, 
accounting for 25% of all breaches. With ransomware on a seemingly 
endless upward trajectory, its unsurprising that it is the most 
common concern this year. Ransomware is also closely linked with 
phishing, with phishing emails serving as the number one delivery 
method for ransomware payloads.
Additionally, unintentional internal threats (54%) were the fourth 
top concern (Figure 2\). This is a large category of threats that consist 
of any actions from employees, contractors, or third\-party vendors 
that inadvertently result in security incidents. This may include 
misconfigurations, failure to follow security policies (i.e. strong 
passwords, ignoring software updates, etc.), or even losing ones 
employee ID card. 
Though part of the broader category of unintentional internal 
threats, misconfigurations were actually a slightly bigger concern for 
respondents. This may be due to how widespread theyve become. 
As IT infrastructures continue to grow in complexity, there is that 
much more potential for errors and oversights in the configuration 
of hardware, software, or network settings. Unfortunately, 
misconfigurations throw the door for attackers wide open, and were 
ultimately responsible for 14% of all breaches in 2022\. 
Supply chain attacks (44%), in which a malicious actor compromises 
an outside partner or supplier to conduct attacks against the 
suppliers customers, can also occur as a result of unintentional 
internal threats. This strategy is increasingly popular amongst 
attackers. In fact, the Verizon report stated that 61% of system 
intrusion incidents were supply chain attacks. Unsurprisingly, 
ransomware is often used in supply chain attacks, making the 
concern around it all the more justified. 
All of these concerns share one thing in common: the inescapable 
threat that employees inadvertently pose to organizations.

Feelings on the value of penetration testing remain the same, with 
94% of respondents once again noting that penetration testing is at 
least somewhat important to their security (Figure 4\). 
While the view on the import of pen testing remained steady, there 
were some changes in the challenges that are being encountered in 
pen testing. First, trouble getting a qualified third\-party is notably 
reduced, down 15% from 2022 (Figure 3\). Pen testing is a rapidly 
growing market, with research predicting to see a market growth of 
$2\.6 billion by 2030\. This means more third\-party service offerings 
to choose from every year. However, such growth makes it worth 
exercising extreme caution when choosing a service provider, as the 
quality will vary greatly. Many focus on basic, routine tests that are 
performed with a pen testing tool, packaging it as a custom service. 
Its critical to find a partner with experts that can tailor their tests for 
your needs and goals, and even advise you on the different testing 
options.
There was also a concerning increase in the lack of resources to act 
on the findings of a pen test, up 23% from last year (Figure 3\). While 
pen testing is an effective means of determining the quality of an 
organizations security and flagging which weaknesses are putting 
you most at risk, the only way to improve your security posture is to 
follow through with actions that close those security gaps, such as 
patching, reconfiguration, or implementing new policies. Penetration 
testing should not be seen as a box to check, but rather a map 
that needs to be followed. Equally important is repeating pen tests 
after the remediation process to validate that fixes were properly 
implemented. 
Lastly, while the 15% drop in security posture confidence (Figure 3\) 
may appear concerning at first glance, it is actually best to err on the 
side of caution when it comes to cybersecurity. Overconfidence often 
translates into stagnation and rigidity, feeling no need to reevaluate 
General Pen Testing Challenges
if all appears well. However, cybersecurity requires constant appraisal 
and flexibility, readjusting and pivoting as attackers find new 
techniques, tactics, and vulnerabilities. This 15% drop could reflect 
that the reality of the current threat landscape is setting in.

Regulations like HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, GDPR, or the CMMC mandate 
appropriate protection of highly sensitive data, like credit card 
numbers, social security numbers, and other personally identifying 
information. Pen tests are not only a way to evaluate an organizations 
security posture, but they can also help verify adherence to these 
regulations, proving to auditors or other authorities that mandated 
security measures are in place or working properly. 
Though there was a decline from last year, pen testing was still 
at least somewhat important to compliance initiatives for 93% 
of respondents (Figure 6\). Interestingly, with an increase in the 
number of data protection and security laws and regulations, pen 
test needs surrounding compliance only seem to be growing. 41% 
of respondents have increased the number of overall pen tests in 
response to these mandates (Figure 7\). 
Compliance initiatives show no signs of slowing, either. The European 
Commission is revising the GDPR in 2023 to streamline cross\-border 
instances of data protection enforcement. Not only are existing 
regulations being continually updated to incorporate new measures, 
new laws and regulations are also emerging. For example, in 2022, 
nearly every US state put forth cybersecurity bills. Additionally, the 
2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy includes a proposal to expand 
requirements for all operators of critical infrastructure. According 
to Gartner, three quarters of the worlds population will be under 
privacy regulations in 2023\. 
While some had to increase the number of pen tests in response 
to compliance initiatives, others had to shift their strategies in 
some other way, whether it was expanding the scope of their tests 
(29%), adding more internal staff (23%), or placing more emphasis 
on certain types of tests, like web application (35%) or social 
engineering (36%) (Figure 7\). Only 16% of respondents reported 
that there was no impact to their pen testing strategies as a result of

compliance needs, illustrating the influence compliance continues to 
have on pen testing approaches.

With the Anti\-Phishing Working Group observing a record 1,270,883 
total phishing attacks in Q3 of 2022 alone, its unsurprising that 
phishing is a top security concern of respondents (70%) (Figure 2\). 
Since phishing is one of the oldest attack tactics around, how 
has it remained so pervasive? Ultimately, its the human element 
of phishing that has kept it remarkably effective. People receive 
so many messages and emails that its easy to become careless, 
clicking on links while your mind is elsewhere. Others overly rely on 
spam filters, which attackers have become adept at evading. Spear 
phishing techniques have also improved, with everything seemingly 
personalized and appearing so authentic that even a cybersecurity 
pro could be fooled. 
Though phishing attacks will persevere, one of the best defenses is 
to keep people on their toes. Running regular phishing simulation 
exercises can help serve as a regular initiative to keep users vigilant 
and train them to exercise more precaution. 
With this in mind, it was encouraging to see an 8% increase in 
monthly phishing simulations (Figure 8\), which is a good cadence 
to promote ongoing awareness. New and existing regulations have 
also underscored the threat phishing poses, with 36% of respondents 
noting that compliance initiatives have placed an increased emphasis 
on social engineering tests (Figure 7\). This may also be reflected in 
the 16% increase in the usage of third\-party testing services for social 
engineering tests (Figure 19\). 
With generative AI making sophisticated phishing emails and texts 
the norm, easy ways to spot attacks like spelling and grammar errors 
may soon become a thing of the past. Instead, users need to question 
the intent of the email and whether the request makes sense. Do 
you often receive emails from this person? Is this how an application 
allows asks you to authenticate your credentials? By running routine 
phishing simulation campaigns with follow up reports and trainings, 
organizations can foster a culture of healthy skepticism.

Penetration Testing Frequency
Results for pen testing frequency have remained consistent. As in 
2022, the majority of respondents are, at most, pen testing only a few 
times a year. While running one to two pen tests (38%) is far better 
than nothing (14%) (Figure 9\), it does raise concerns about retesting. 
An initial test provides guidance on remediation, but a retest is critical 
for ensuring these vulnerabilities have been successfully mitigated. 
Improperly applying a patch may not just leave the vulnerability intact, 
it can also open new security gaps. Remediation validation should 
not just be left for the next years round of testing. However, when 
resources are limited, making a business case for retesting may prove 
difficult. This aligns with the finding of respondents encountering 
challenges with the lack of follow up (58%) from pen tests (Figure 3\). 
Running too few tests isnt ideal, but running daily or even weekly 
pen tests may be impractical, since they do require the already scarce 
resources of time, budget, and talent. In order to run daily pen tests, 
you would need to have a large pen testing team. Even then, they 
would likely only be able to run smaller pen tests on different parts of 
the infrastructurerunning a large scope pen test every single day 
would be a difficult challenge. However, though 8% of respondents 
reported daily pen testing (Figure 9\), just 50% of those respondents 
had internal teams of more than five team members. For the other 
50%, it may be that they are instead referring to the frequency with 
which vulnerability scans are being run. Vulnerability management 
solutions are typically highly automated and can easily be scheduled 
to run on a daily basis, while pen testing requires more advanced 
planning. 
Those running monthly (12%) or even quarterly (20%) tests (Figure 
1\. are more likely to have achieved a balance, having the means for 
testing and retesting without placing a strain on resources. However, 
penetration testing frequency is a perfect example of where best 
practices collide with real world practicalities. Every security team will 
have to determine their needs while keeping resources and budgets in 
mind.

In\-House Penetration Testing Efforts
Having pen testing capabilities in\-house can quickly expand pen 
testing efforts, allowing for more frequent tests and coverage of 
a wider scope of the IT infrastructure. It also ensures that changes 
to the infrastructure are more efficiently assessed to ensure new 
security gaps arent opened. This year shows a small amount growth 
of in\-house pen testing efforts, with a 7% increase from last year in 
the number of respondents who have an internal pen testing team at 
their organization (Figure 10\). 
Curiously, the size of pen testing teams seems to be fluctuating, with 
teams both growing and shrinking. While there is a 21% increase in 
the number of teams with 3\-5 members, there is an 11% decrease in 
the number of teams with 1\-2 members and 10% decrease in teams 
of 6 or more(Figure 11\). 
The decrease in larger teams may be illustrative of the cybersecurity 
skills gap, which continues to persist. In fact, according to (ISC)s 
2022 Cybersecurity Workforce Study, the cybersecurity workforce 
gap has grown more than twice as much as the workforce with a 
26\.2% year\-over\-year increase. In a field with so many job openings, 
it wouldnt be uncommon for there to be more turnover and 
instability in team size. Pen testing tools may be helping offset the 
skills gap, with a 14% increase in the number of respondents who 
cited that pen testing technology has at least some influence on an 
organizations decision on having an in\-house team (Figure 14\).
While there was an increase in the number of respondents with 
in\-house pen testing teams, there were still more respondents who 
either had lost their in\-house team or never had one to begin with. 
Reasons for the lack of an in\-house team vary, with top reasons 
being insufficient need (48%), lack of talent (36%), and lack of 
funding (28%) (Figure 13\). Interestingly, there is a 12% decrease in 
respondents citing insufficient need for a full\-time pen testing team. 
This may reflect a growing acknowledgement of the usefulness of 
in\-house pen testing teams, or even pen testing in general.

Third\-party pen testing teams remain a popular resource, with 78% 
of respondents leveraging third\-party teams in some capacity (Figure 
18\). However, there was a noteworthy shift indicating an increased 
preference for in\-house testing, with a 16% drop in those who used 
mostly or exclusively third\-party services and a 13% increase in those 
who use all or mostly in\-house testing (Figure 18\). Though many 
assume an in\-house team is meant as a replacement for third\-party 
services, organizations should ideally use both, so it was promising 
to see even a modest 5% increase in those who have an even split 
between in\-house and third\-party. 
What makes an even split ideal? While an internal pen testing 
team can provide regular, standardized testing, they also become 
quite familiar with the environment that theyre assessing. The top 
reason third\-party services are solicited is because of their external, 
objective point of view (58%) (Figure 15\). Additionally, since third\-
party teams are fully immersed specialists that can stay up to date on 
the latest trends and techniques, they are also frequently utilized to 
apply different skillsets (50%). Wanting an impartial assessment and 
a diversity of skills may also be a reason for why 76% of organizations 
tend to change services at least every 2\-3 years (Figure 17\). 
There was a 13% drop in the use of third\-party services for 
compliance. As mentioned earlier, compliance regulations are 
expanding in number and complexity, so this may be more of a 
reflection of teams managing their compliance needs internally 
rather than outsourcing. Many falsely assume that in order to meet 
compliance needs, third\-party testing is required. However, this 
typically is not the case. In fact, PCI DSS, which has some of the most 
explicit requirements for pen testing, does not state that a third\-
party test is necessary. Some organizations find third\-party services 
ideal for determining compliance needs and obtaining strategic 
support with initial tests. They then use pen testing tools to maintain 
compliance. 
Third\-Party Services
Lastly, though they are used most often for network (81%) and 
application (65%) testing, it is worth pointing out that third\-parties 
are utilized by 36% of respondents for physical pen tests (Figure 19\). 
These tests involve attempting to gain entry to a physical facility, 
system, or network through the exploitation of weaknesses like 
doors, locks, cameras, or other access controls. Such assessments can 
only be completed by third\-parties, further highlighting the unique 
services they can provide.

services in addition to pen testing. The use of third\-party security 
awareness training (52%) appears to be the most commonly 
deployed (Figure 20\). Awareness trainings have become a standard 
practice, with almost all regulations mandating some sort of security 
awareness program. Aside from being a compliance requirement, 
training programs are also frequently used as a follow\-up to phishing 
simulations to improve vigilance.
Red teaming is also common, with 38% of respondents reporting 
that they use this service (Figure 20\). Red teaming is often the next 
offensive security layer added after solidifying a pen testing program. 
These engagements emulate a real\-world scenario, taking on the 
offensive role of an attacker who will have to evade detection and 
beat security controls, including the organizations own security 
team. While the goal of a penetration test is demonstrating the 
potential of vulnerability exploitation, the goal of a Red Team 
exercise is testing an organizations ability to successfully detect and 
respond to attacks, so that security teams can learn and improve 
from the exercise.

Pen Testing Tools
Penetration testing tools are a broad category and can include 
specialized tools like port scanners, password crackers, or SQL 
injection tools, as well as more comprehensive tools that offer 
multiple features to centralize the testing process. Respondents still 
almost universally use at least one pen testing tool of some kind, 
but there were some interesting changes in the usage of free vs 
commercial tools. The use of both open source and commercial tools 
was down 21%. Meanwhile, usage of solely open source tools was up 
15% and the usage of solely commercial tools was up 5% (Figure 21\).
This years numbers are actually more similar to those from the 2021 
report. The 2022 report speculated that the increase in those using 
both commercial and open\-source tools and the decrease in those 
solely using freeopen\-source tools may have reflected the economic 
recovery after the downturn of previous years, enabling them to add 
one or more commercial tools to their library. This years data may be 
showing the effects of inflation, which was shown to have impacted 
cybersecurity budgets. This seems reinforced by the 9% increase 
in cost as a consideration when evaluating paid pen testing tools 
(Figure 22\).
Though down from last year, features and functionality still remain 
the top consideration when searching for a paid pen testing tool, 
with 81% of respondents listing it as an important evaluation 
criterion (Figure 22\). In terms of the features that theyre looking for, 
reporting (71%), multi\-vector testing capabilities (66%), and having 
an extensive threat library (65%) remained the top three sought after 
capabilities in paid penetration testing tools (Figure 23\). 
Interestingly, templatesautomation capabilities saw a 13% increase 
from last year (Figure 23\). Automation capabilities not only allow 
advanced testers to spend their time diving deep into more dynamic 
problems, they also help new testers get up to speed by aiding in 
the completion of routine pen tests. As mentioned earlier, many 
organizations are only running one or two tests annually, which may

Other Security 
Assessment Solutions
When taking an offensive security approach, new solutions will be 
added as your strategy matures. One foundational piece of effective 
offensive security is a vulnerability scanner, as they are a fundamental 
part of vulnerability management. These assessments provide 
visibility into the state of an organizations security on a regular basis. 
Routine, automated scans of networks and web applications identify 
and prioritize security weaknesses using external intelligence. 
Penetration testing is seen as the next step in vulnerability 
management journey, since the data vulnerability scans provide can 
augment penetration tests, providing insights into which weaknesses 
warrant additional investigation. Since respondents have already 
incorporated pen testing into their strategies, its unsurprising 
that the majority of respondents (86%) already have vulnerability 
scanners (Figure 24\).
Just as in 2022, post\-exploitation (32%) and adversary simulation 
(27%) are significantly less common tools. These solutions are 
typically only used by those who have a more mature program that 
can deploy red team engagements. Many businesses, particularly 
SMBs, dont have a large enough security team to do so and may 
instead rely on third\-party services. As seen in Figure 13, staffing 
challenges may prevent a larger organization from building an in\-
house pen testing team, let alone a red team. Other organizations 
may simply not be at this stage in their security journey, as full 
offensive security maturity cannot be achieved overnight.

Vendor Consolidation
IT infrastructures are continuing to expand both in size and 
sophistication, with organizations finding themselves needing 
more assets and applications than ever before to effectively run 
day\-to\-day operations. The number of vendors an organization 
has to deal with can not only be overwhelming to manage, it can 
also become a cybersecurity risk. More vendors that have access 
to your environment can mean more potential attack vectors. By 
consolidating vendors, organizations can streamline operations and 
limit complexity, which reduces the attack surface and simplifies risk 
management. 
Vendor consolidation has become an increasingly popular 
strategy, even for cybersecurity solutions, with most respondents 
considering it either somewhat important (37%) or important (43%) 
to consolidate security vendors (Figure 25\). With the necessity of a 
layered security approach, it makes sense to choose solutions from a 
single vendor, especially those that can offer platform centralization, 
integration or interoperability features, unified support, cost savings, 
and more.

Pen Testing in Different Environments
As the most universal operating system, it is not surprising to see that 
Windows is once again the most common area (82%) respondents 
were concerned about testing (Figure 26\). Windows can be run 
throughout an organization, including workstations, servers, and 
other assets. Additionally, Windows Active Directory is the heart of 
most organizational infrastructures, as it facilitates and centralizes 
network management and serves as a database, storing usernames, 
passwords, permissions, and more. Unfortunately, this makes it a 
prime target for attackers, as anyone who has domain admin rights 
to Active Directory has the ability to access, create, or modify any of 
the main accounts.
Though Windows is the most common, its clear there is some level 
of concern about other operating systems, like Linux (54%), Unix 
(18%), and IBM (12%) (Figure 26\), which are typically only used on 
application or database servers. While access to these servers is 
more limited and operating systems have long held a reputation of 
being secure, they are by no means immune to an attack. Storing 
critical and sensitive data also makes them a target, so its wise for 
organizations to include them in the pen testing scope.
One noteworthy change from last year is an 11% uptick in mobile 
pen testing (Figure 26\). 2022 saw a record number of attacks on 
smartphones, which may have prompted more organizations 
to determine the state of their own mobile security. Mobile 
environments are particularly vulnerable, as they are susceptible 
to multiple types of phishing attacks, including vishing (voice 
phishing), smishing (SMS phishing), and quishing (QR code phishing) 
attacks. Additionally, as MFA becomes more universal, phones are 
increasingly used as a means of authentication. Attackers are now 
using SIM swapping attacks to temporarily gain access to a phone 
in order to access or divert messages with authentication passcodes. 
With attack methods such as these, organizations are right to 
incorporate mobile pen testing, particularly phishing campaigns.
Cloud infrastructures experienced a similar spike in attacks in 2022, 
with nearly double the number from 2021\. Unfortunately, cloud 
infrastructures (47%) remained significantly less commonly tested 
than internal and external infrastructures (Figure 27\). As more 
resources and services become cloud based, organizations may 
need to reconsider their testing strategies to incorporate more 
assessments of cloud security.

The goal of this survey was to provide visibility into how cybersecurity 
professionals are utilizing pen testing. The results revealed the wide range 
of ways that people pen test and the elements shaping how they pen test. 
Organizations have many options to choose from when putting together 
a pen testing approach, which may seem daunting. Careful evaluation is 
needed when determining which tests to run, how often to run them, and 
whether they should be conducted in\-house or by a third party. Fortunately, 
the variety of options is also what enables organizations of all different sizes 
and industries to tailor a strategy to suit their needs and resources. 
Despite the acknowledgment of the importance of pen testing, the challenge 
of limited resources continues to endure. Though innovative tools can help 
with resource limitations and the skills gap, organizations will also have to 
make difficult decisions about which parts of their environment are most in 
need of assessment. 
Pen testing programs are not without their obstacles, but the benefits of 
incorporating this proactive security practice demonstrate that they are 
well worth it. From vulnerability management to regulations requirements, 
pen testing helps reduce risk and continually elevate the security of an IT 
environment by providing guidance on how to close security gaps or stay 
compliant. Most importantly, penetration testing helps reduce the risk of 
incidents that put organizations finances, efficiency, and trustworthiness at 
stake.
