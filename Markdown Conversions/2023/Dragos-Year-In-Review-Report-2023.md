The Dragos threatintelligence teams assess and research vulnerabilities and actively track adversaries impacting operational technology.Dragos consultants and responders provide frontline perspectives from various engagements, including assessments,exercises, and incident response. Since Dragos first started gathering data for Year in Review in 2017, many trends haveremained consistent with notable milestones along the way. The data and perspectives presented in this report arefocused on the global industries that Dragos serves.2016 CRASHOVERRIDENot identified

facilities and equipment that are designed to protect 
bulk electric systems were manipulated to have the 
opposite effect. The CRASHOVERIDE legacy lives 
on with a series of attacks utilizing INDUSTROYER2 
malware observed as recently as October 2022\.2017 TRISISThe threat group XENOTIME 
deployed the TRISIS malware against a 
Safety Instrumentation System (SIS) at apetrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia. TRISIS represents 
the expansion of malware targets and methods of 
execution, and the first time system safety features 
have been targeted and compromised directly.2018 EXPANDED THREAT GROUPS 
In 2018, Dragos expanded the number of 
Threat Groups tracked from 3 to 8\. This trendcontinued over time to date there are 21 Dragos\-
designated Threat Groups with the intent to gain access 
to OT environments and potentially disrupt them.2019 INCREASED RANSOMWARE IN OT
In 2019, Dragos tracked a 50 percent 
uptick in ransomware within OT. The firstransomware case Dragos responded to occurred within 
the electric sector also in 2019\.2020 EKANS RANSOMWAREDragos 
analyzed EKANS malware variants with 
capabilities to stop ICS\-related Windowsprocesses before initiating encryption. This functionality 
represents a natural but troubling consequence of target 
expansion. Ransomware groups increase the odds of 
victims paying a ransom when business is disrupted.2021 \- RANSOMWARE ATTACK IMPACTS OT
In 2021, Colonial Pipeline was impacted 
by ransomware, causing a precautionary 
shutdown of OT operations. Again,ransomware instances continued to balloon in 2023 
with 905 instances, an increase of nearly 50 percent 
over the last year.2022 ENTER CHERNOVITEIn 2022

This includes identifying your organizations internet routable netblocks and IPspace, including what contractors or vendors may have set up for you. Network scan yourpublic spaces and compare it against Shodan, Whois, and your documentation. Ensurecritical assets or assets connected to your process environment are not discoverable fromthe internet. Learn more about why this guidance is important from the 2023 attack onUnitronics PLC devices by the CyberAv3ngers on page 11\.HAND\-POINT\-RIGHT If you havent segmented your network yet, the best time for that was in the 2000s; thesecond best time is now. This network segmentation includes separating devices with networkand host\-based firewalls by function, not just systems from the internet, but systems fromeach other and critical processes. Do not merely focus on IPv4 when your systems also useIPv6\. When operators traverse network zones to log in using a virtual private network (VPN),remote desktop protocol (RDP), or other remote access tools, they should leverage separateauthentication. In 2023, increased ransomware impacts on OT environments highlight thenecessity of this old but still useful guidance. Read more on Ransomware on page 21\.HAND\-POINT\-RIGHT Restricting and monitoring outbound communication is also important in addition tosegmentation. This includes evaluating default routes, gateways, and firewall rules to externalnetworks and proxy configurations. In 2023, several adversaries, such as VOLTZITE, GANANITE,and ransomware groups, leveraged communication to external networks for command andcontrol (C2\) communication, allowing exfiltration of data and remote control of network assets.For more on this see the OT Cyber Threat Landscape section of this report on page 9\.HAND\-POINT\-RIGHT If your organization already regularly assesses standard guidance, such as auditingsegmentation rules and configuration, you still have work to do. As defensible architecturecontinues to mature, adversary techniques shift with it. Learn which techniques ourpenetration testers leverage in OT assessments in the Frontline Perspective section on page20, as well as which techniques still work for ransomware groups on page 21 and threatgroups on page 9\. Understanding the attack surface is vital for prioritizing a response oridentifying adversaries within your network. Hunting for evidence of these techniques in usewithin your monitoring system is the best way to identify unwanted operators hiding in yourOT environment.HAND\-POINT\-RIGHT Lastly, reduce the risk of vulnerable equipment used in OT processes, but do it ina systematic way.

VULNERABILITIESIn 2023, the U.S. Government informed Rockwell Automation of twovulnerabilities impacting a subset of ControlLogix communicationmodules. These communication modules are part of a significant RockwellAutomation product line and assist in controlling processes in manyindustrial verticals. In coordination with their government partners,Rockwell Automation organized a defensive working group comprisedof various vendors, including Dragos. The working groups goal: developdetections for these vulnerabilities and search for evidence of exploitation.As part of the working group, Dragos analysts studied the vulnerabilities andthe impacted communications modules. With Rockwell Automation andother community members, they developed detection signatures that wouldalert on artifacts specific to varying methods of potential exploitation. Dragosvulnerability analysts deployed these signatures to Neighborhood Keeperand OT Watch to find signs of malicious activity. They triaged any alerts,paying attention to false positives and tuning signatures accordingly.Dragos analysts passed the detection results back to the working groupso that the rest of the community could tune their signatures for theirrespective platforms. In this way, Neighborhood Keeper helped thecommunity to avoid unnecessary alerting once the detections andvulnerabilities were made public. Aside from signature tuning, NeighborhoodKeeper provided visibility into the number of vulnerable devices and howwidespread their use is in different industries and regions. Dragos passedthis information back to the working group so that they could assess thevulnerabilities risk and potential impact.The collaboration between the U.S. Government and Rockwell Automation,along with the formation of a working group of security vendors to ensurea defensive front before public release, and the coordinated publishing ofvulnerability information, represents a significant accomplishment for theindustrial control systems (ICS) community. Product owners and OEMs canlook to Rockwell Automation as an excellent example of community anddefense\-forward practice and consider following this path for vulnerabilitydisclosure. This new approach of blending U.S. Government intelligencewith security industry expertise and OEM knowledge is undoubtedlythe way forward in combating future cyber adversary threats to criticalinfrastructure.Dragos Frontline PerspectiveTHE VULNERABILITIES

The adversaries involved in theseactivities varied widely in terms of their level of sophistication, deployed capabilities, and intended targets.On one end of the spectrum, some threat groups used advanced techniques, such as leveraging nativefunctionality, including living off the land (LOTL) techniques, to conduct reconnaissance and intelligenceoperations. Conversely, some adversaries targeted low\-hanging fruit such as internet\-accessible devices thatlacked proper hardening, thus making them easy to damage and cause operational disruptions.Threat groups continued to use publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and discover and develop their own capabilities. Most ofthe observed threat activity targeted IT\-centric devices that are commonly used in OT, such as Sierra Wireless modems orCitrix. In 2023, Dragos worked with one of our strategic partners, Rockwell Automation, on a community response to a setof adversary\-developed vulnerabilities targeting OT devices. The identified vulnerabilities have the potential to result inlossdenial of view (T0829, T0815\), denialmanipulation of control (T0813, T0831\), theft of operational information (T0882\),and loss of productivity and revenue (T0828\).CONFLICT\-DRIVEN THREAT ACTIVITY
The overlaps of OT cybersecurity threats with regional and globalkinetic events have never been more evident than in 2023\. Cyberadversaries with a range of capabilities have used the Ukraine\-Russia and Israel\-Hamas wars to conduct targeted operations againstcritical infrastructure, and less sophisticated hacktivists have usedthe same conflicts to cause panic and negatively impact publicperception of the resilience of critical services. Geopolitical tensionsworldwide, including in Asia and Africa, have also driven intelligencegathering and capability staging activity.The Ukraine\-Russia conflict drove the activity of more maturethreat groups, such as ELECTRUM, which conducted targetedcyber operations against Ukrainian critical infrastructure entities.A new destructive wiper malware attributed to ELECTRUM wasobserved in the wild in June 2023\. Later, in September 2023, Dragosreported on a spear\-phishing campaign that targeted Ukrainiancritical infrastructure organizations linked with ELECTRUM andKAMACITE. Lastly, in November 2023, a cybersecurity vendorpublished a report providing evidence of destructive malwareactivity targeting Ukrainian electric substations in October 2022\.Dragos assessed with moderate confidence that ELECTRUMconducted the October 2022 destructive malware activity.9PAPER\-PLANEinfo@dragos.comX\-TWITTER@DragosInclinkedin@Dragos, Inc.OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2023According to multiple sources, the mounting tension between China andTaiwan also contributed to increased targeted cyber espionage attacksagainst multiple industrial organizations in the Asia\-Pacific region andthe United States.1One threat group in particular, VOLTZITE, has targetednumerous critical infrastructure entities in Guam, the United States, andother countries since at least 2021\. VOLTZITE overlaps with Volt Typhoon, agroup that the U.S. Government has publicly linked to the Peoples Republicof China. VOLTZITE heavily uses living off the land (LOTL) techniques and,in some cases, has been observed conducting hands\-on keyboard post\-compromise actions within a victims networks.Dragos Frontline PerspectiveLiving off the land (LOTL) describes the 
use of typically pre\-existing, legitimate 
capabilities present on a victim host and 
network for malicious purposes. In the 
information technology (IT) world, this 
means using native system capabilities 
such as PowerShell or server message 
block (SMB) as part of an attack. In 
the OT world, this can mean using the 
native functionality of a PLC or control 
system to issue a control command.VOLTZITE has shown continued interest in the electric andtelecommunications sectors in the United States, evidenced by the long\-Dragos Frontline Perspectiveterm reconnaissance of multiple electric entities. If VOLTZITE establishesan initial foothold on the network perimeter of a target, it may then be ableto pivot further into a victims information technology (IT) network andthen move laterally onto the victims OT network. Dragos has only observedVOLTZITE operations achieving Stage 1 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain. Theyhave not displayed actions or capabilities designed to disrupt, degrade, ordestroy ICSOT assets or operations.Dragos leverages its intelligence to drive hunting with our customerenvironment and the community.

Another interesting finding was VOLTZITE overlaps with infrastructure associated with the MiraiBotnet and another activity cluster that differs from VOLTZITE but may be operationally connected.Dragoss analysis of VOLTZITE operations underscores the need for ongoing vigilance among organizations operatingin the global electric sector, as the observed activity suggests continued and specific interest in these networks. Further,VOLTZITEs actions involving prolonged surveillance and data gathering align with Volt Typhoons assessed objectives ofreconnaissance and gaining geopolitical advantage in the Asia\-Pacific region.1h t t p s : w w w. c i s a . g o v n e w s \- e v e n t s c y b e r s e c u r i t y \- a d v i s o r i e s a a 2 3 \- 1 4 4 a ;h t t p s : w w w. m i c r o s o f t . c o m e n \- u s s e c u r i t y

Pro\-Russia groups like CyberArmyofRussia\_Reborn attacked industrial organizations in Europe in May 2023\.NoName057(16\) attacked European and North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) aligned countries and their manufacturingand transportation organizations. Additionally, Anonymous Sudanwas also observed attacking the United States and other NATO\-aligned entities. Similar activity has been observed with pro\-Hamashacktivist groups such as the CyberAv3ngers and Team InsanePakistan claiming disruptive attacks against Israeli Railways, anIsraeli towns power grid system, and an Israeli hydroelectric plant. Inlate December 2023, the hacktivist group Predatory Sparrow allegedlydisrupted Iranian gas stations with an unspecified cyber attack.These operations also included the successful compromise of public\-facing OT devices, as was observed in late November with the attackon Unitronics devices. The CyberAv3ngers successfully compromisednumerous U.S European, and Australian industrial companies usinginternet\-accessible Unitronics PLC devices. Dragos assesses withmoderate confidence that the adversaries scanned the open internet toidentify publicly accessible Unitronics devices and then attempted to loginto the devices using the Unitronics default password. This adversaryappears not to possess OT capabilities; however, this attack still led to aLoss of View and Control (T0829, T0827\) for some of those impacted.Dragos Frontline 
PerspectiveThe hacktivists DDoS 
attacks had minimal 
impacts and primarily disrupted the 
organizations websites. In many 
cases, Dragos found that claims of 
disruptive attacks against critical 
infrastructure were wildly exaggerated 
or completely fabricated. However, 
most hacktivist groups aim to gain 
notoriety, spread misinformation, cause 
fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), and 
draw international media attention to 
geopolitical and social causes.Dragos Frontline PerspectiveDragos identified over 1800 internet\-
exposed Unitronics devices, but only 
0\.0001 percent of Neighborhood 
Keeper monitored assets are Unitronics. 
Dragos assesses with moderate 
confidence that Unitronics devices 
are more common in environments 
with limited visibility, such as remote 
locations or smaller organizations. 
This type of device is often deployed 
without proper visibility or hardening. 
Basic hygiene and device management 
are critical to stopping this activity, 
including understanding what is 
publicly accessible.IIS

The environmentcontinues to be monitored via the Dragos Platform and OT Watch.Taking the success of the threat hunt and the detailed understanding on the tactics of this threat group provided bythe Dragos Intelligence team, OT Watch extended the hunt across all relevant OT Watch customers.The Dragos Intelligence team enhanced the effort by analyzing Neighborhood Keeper data for indications ofVOLTZITE behaviors and then notifying impacted parties anonymously. With these findings, Dragos threatdetections engineers developed high\-fidelity detections back into the Platform deployed via Dragos Knowledge Packsfor continuous monitoring.The overall response to the VOLTZITE threat highlights the importance of coordinated efforts and the advantage ofICSOT capabilities unique to Dragos. This engagement not only addressed a complex threat but also strengthened theprotective measures across critical infrastructure customers.14PAPER\-PLANEinfo@dragos.comX\-TWITTER@DragosInclinkedin@Dragos, Inc.Dragos Frontline PerspectiveAsset owners often deploy cellular gateways such as the Sierra Wireless devices in remote locations where wired connections 
are not practical or economical. These gateways are usually connected directly to OT devices, exposing those devices to 
misconfiguration or vulnerabilities of the gateway. Given the limited visibility and reliance on a single layer of protection when a 
gateway and connected device are compromised, long adversary dwell times are possible.Data LoggerProtective 
RelayPLCRTUCellular
GatewayDragos has seen these devices used by utilities for pole\-top deployments connected to CAP banks and reclosers and at remote 
pump stations, storage tanks, and lift stations. Further, Dragos has seen their use in MET towers, small hydro, distributed solar, 
and storage in generation environments. The most concerning instances are when Dragos has found cellular gateways connected 
to larger control systems such as a DCS or PLC Process Control Network (PCN) as a remote access mechanism that bypasses 
standard security controls. Organizations must have an accurate asset inventory and visibility to protect against the risk that 
these types of devices introduce to an industrial environment.15PAPER\-PLANEinfo@dragos.comX\-TWITTER@DragosInclinkedin@Dragos, Inc.OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2023GANANITETARGETS: ASIAGANANITE is a Dragos\-designated ThreatGroup that targets critical infrastructure andgovernment entities in the Commonwealth ofIndependent States and Central Asian nations.GANANITE focuses on espionage and data theft,with the possibility of handing off initial accessto other threat groups.

IT environment (Stage 1\) which allows for a crossing into the ICS 
network, culminating in final reconnaissance and penetration of 
control system resources (Stage 2\). Its worth noting that Stage 1 
does not always take place in a victims IT environment, but the 
compromise may be in a vendors environment that has access to the 
enterprises OT environment.16PAPER\-PLANEinfo@dragos.comX\-TWITTER@DragosInclinkedin@Dragos, Inc.OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2023Further, GANANITEs operations have displayed extensiveresearch and use of known exploits against the externalperimeter of its targets. GANANITE uses tools such asShodan and FOFA search engines that contain data aboutinternet\-facing assets to build a profile of its target. Afteridentifying the IP netblocks of its target, they then utilizedata from Shodan and FOFA to identify any presenceof devices exhibiting known exploitable vulnerabilities.GANANITE then moves on to exploit those vulnerabilitieswith publicly available exploits. For those reasons,industrial organizations in Europe and Central Asia facea significant risk from GANANITE due to their initialintrusion capabilities, post\-compromise espionage TTPs,and intellectual property theft, all of which can be used infollow\-on attacks against the victim organizations.Dragos Frontline PerspectiveAdversaries use command and 
control (C2\) to communicate with 
and control compromised systems 
by leveraging standard protocols 
like HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS for 
communication channels. C2 
capabilities have progressed to the 
point where some frameworks can 
integrate third\-party applications or 
non\-traditional network protocols 
to facilitate or hide C2 traffic. Dragos 
researches how threat groups 
use common OT protocols for C2 
operations and develop capabilities 
as part of a proof of concept.Dragos focused on open platform 
communication unified architecture 
(OPC UA) and DNP3, given its 
widespread utilization across a range 
of critical industrial environments 
and the availability of robust open\-

These OT C2 capabilities enabled 
the Dragos penetration testing team

resulted in significant downstream impacts on 
industrial operations.19PAPER\-PLANEinfo@dragos.comX\-TWITTER@DragosInclinkedin@Dragos, Inc.OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2023UPDATES ON SOME OF THE MOST ACTIVE THREAT GROUPSELECTRUM
ELECTRUM, a Dragos\-tracked threat group that overlaps with Sandworm, was highly active throughout 2023 and theiroperations were largely influenced by the Ukraine\-Russia conflict. For example, a new wiper malware was identified inJune 2023 with characteristics similar to RoarBat and was used to target Windows operating systems. ELECTRUM hasused wiper malware previously, such as AcidRain and CaddyWiper, which was previously part of the INDUSTROYER2event. Another noteworthy ELECTRUM observation involving wiper malware came in November 2023 when Mandiantpublished a report about disruptive cyber attacks against a Ukrainian electric substation in October 2022\. In that attack,ELECTRUM exploited a vulnerable hypervisor running end\-of\-life MicroSCADA software in the OT environment and useda (then) new version of CaddyWiper malware.RASPITE \& MAGNALLIUM
Dragos also observed that threat groups such as RASPITE andMAGNALLIUM conducted widespread campaigns scanning forvulnerable SMB devices and using password\-spraying techniquesagainst various industry sectors, including defense and mining.Interestingly, MAGNALLIUM is a Dragos\-tracked threat groupthat had seemingly disappeared for nearly a year until they begantheir password\-spraying operations again in July 2023 againstmultiple defense and mining organizations. Prior MAGNALLIUMcyber operations have included initial access and reconnaissanceactions before deploying destructive wiper malware on thevictims IT networks.KAMACITE
In addition to the ELECTRUM activity, KAMACITE continuedtargeting Ukrainian telecommunications entities throughearly 2023 using spearphishing and the DarkCrystal remoteaccess trojan and then leveraging LOTL techniques withinvictim networks. This activity continues a multi\-year trendof KAMACITE conducting initial intrusion operations againstUkraine entities and, more broadly, reconnaissance operationsagainst global industrial entities likely in pursuit of enablingfollow\-on intrusion operations from threat groups likeELECTRUM.Dragos Frontline PerspectiveDragoss tracked threat groups are based 
on clusters of activity relevant to assessed 
capabilities, intent, victimology, and 
infrastructure. From our perspective, it is 
common for Dragos\-tracked threat groups to 
go into periods of dormancy. This dormancy can 
be because their operational objectives have 
shifted, they are conducting more IT\-oriented 
cyber attacks against a broader range of entities 
that do not fall within the industrial organization 
category, or they are developing new tools and 
standing up new infrastructure to stay ahead of 
security researchers and law enforcement.Dragos Frontline PerspectiveThe DarkCrystal remote access trojan (a.k.a. 
DCRat) is a widely available remote access trojan 
first observed in 2018 and has been used by 
numerous adversaries with varying levels of 
sophistication and capabilities. DarkCrystal RAT is 
often available through Darknet criminal forums 
and marketplaces and can be used to remotely 
access compromised networks, steal information 
such as user credentials from victim networks, 
and collect network information.20PAPER\-PLANEinfo@dragos.comX\-TWITTER@DragosInclinkedin@Dragos, Inc.OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2023Dragos Frontline PerspectiveDragos leveraged its visibility of adversary activity to mirror 
commonly used and emerging tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) when conducting penetration testing. This 
includes using public\-facing reconnaissance and open\-source 
intelligence (OSINT) to understand exploitation paths into an 
environment. Once initial access was established, the focus 
shifted to establishing persistence, expanding access, and 
compromising the OT objectives.Throughout 2023, Dragos leveraged common MITRE ATT\&CK 
information\-gathering tactics, including Reconnaissance 
(TA0043\), Discovery (TA0102\), and Initial Access (TA0108\) to 
identify potential accounts and assets that could be exploited. 
This included finding internet\-accessible OT assets (5 percent 
in 2023, up slightly from the 4 percent observed in 2022\), 
identifying domain trusts between IT and OT (9 percent in 2023, 
down 13 percent from 22 percent in 2022\), and remote services

Crown Jewels. The Dragos team identified many lateral movement 
techniques in 2023 but often leveraged common avenues to 
illustrate security gaps between IT and OT environments.In 2023, on almost 5 percent of network penetration tests, the 
Dragos team moved laterally throughout an OT environment 
using Default Credentials (T0812\). They also found that 
Hardcoded Credentials (T0891\) can lead to the same result or 
even increased access. Dragos identified custom Python and 
PowerShell scripts that perform automated functions across 
domains, networks, and assets in multiple assessments. These 
cleartext and default credentials were collected and tested across 
the in\-scope assets to identify credential reuse or misuse.21PAPER\-PLANEinfo@dragos.comX\-TWITTER@DragosInclinkedin@Dragos, Inc.OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 20232023 INDUSTRIAL RANSOMWARE ANALYSISINCREASE IN RANSOMWARE ACTIVITY
Dragos observed 50 active ransomware groups impacting industrialorganizations in 2023 out of 77 groups that have historically attackedindustrial organizations and infrastructure. This represents a 28 percentincrease over last year. Dragos tracked 905 reported ransomwareincidents impacting industrial organizations in 2023, a 49\.5 percentincrease from 2022\. Industrial organizations have much to lose becauseoperational disruptions can carry significant financial and reputationalcosts. Further, there can be numerous cascading impacts on downstreambusinesses and outputs. This leads to high\-leverage situations.Ransomware adversaries and their activity vary widely in techniquesemployed and sophistication demonstrated and they haveimpacted a broad range of industrial targets in 2023\. Hundreds ofransomware variants exist in the wild, such as LockBit, ALPHV,Hunters International, Rhysida, and NoEscape. Although there are moreransomware groups in the wild than were active in 2023, it is importantto remember that a widespread practice within the criminal ecosystemis for groups to rebrand and create offshoot ransomware variants.INDUSTRIAL RANSOMWARE ATTACKS
LockBit ransomware was the most\-used ransomware variant againstindustrial organizations throughout 2023\.Specifically, LockBitoperations accounted for 25 percent of the total ransomware incidentsagainst industrial organizations in 2023, with ALPHV and BlackBastaaccounting for 9 percent each. LockBit, like many ransomware groups,operates as a Ransomware\-as\-a\-Service (RaaS) provider.LockBit operators capitalize on extortion tactics to increase theprobability of the victim paying the ransom. One such tactic is stealingsensitive data, including industrial data from victim organizations, withStealBit, an information stealing tool created by the LockBit developersand typically deployed before LockBit encrypts compromised systems.If the victim doesnt pay the ransom, the stolen data is posted to theLockBit dark web resources, which other adversaries can leverage.49\.5%

Post\-compromise TTPs will vary slightly betweenransomware groups and their affiliates, but most leverageLOTL techniques. This includes using native tools likePsExec and PowerShell to move laterally through thevictims network and discover highly desirable targets. Afterestablishing remote access to one of these targets, threatgroups continue to leverage LOTL tools to escalate privileges(Task Manager, BitsAdmin, and WMIC), gain persistence(Scheduled Tasks), and establish command\-and\-control (SSHand Rundll32\) channels.The figure at right shows the LOTL TTPs used by thedifferent pen test teams. In addition to using LOTL,adversaries will also use non\-native tools.

OT VULNERABILITIESVULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW
Vulnerability advisories provide information on common hardware andsoftware vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). Dragos analyzes vulnerabilityadvisories associated with ICSOT environments and prioritizes them sothat asset owners of industrial organizations do not have to.The difference between IT and OT environments is pronounced whenassessing vulnerabilities. The type of devices, systems, and protocolsused within OT environments, the network architecture of typical OTnetworks, and the impact vulnerabilities can have on normal operationsand the physical world drive these differences. OT Vulnerabilities shouldbe mitigated and addressed differently than IT vulnerabilities based onthe strict operational requirements of OT systems (e.g system uptime andvendor qualification processes).Many vulnerability management programs focus their remediation onCritical vulnerabilities with a CVSS of 9\.0 or higher. That is, programsspecify that these vulnerabilities should be mitigated with urgency. Thereare three problems with this approach.First: Researchers often have no input to the final copy of a publicadvisory and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores maybe inaccurate.The reliance on industrial OEMs, which differ in maturitylevels, makes it difficult for the industrial community to have consistentscoring and severity guidance. Because of this, the vulnerabilityDragos Frontline PerspectiveDragos predicts the number of 
vulnerability advisories relevant to 
industrial operations will double in the 
next five years. This rapid growth in 
vulnerabilities is attributed to vendors 
and researchers being more focused on 
OT and because Dragos is tracking an 
increasing number of sources.14% increase

CVSS misapplication is the most common form of error encountered invulnerability advisories. Dragos corrects CVSS scores and often directlycontacts the vendors and researchers for clarification on how anadversary might exploit a given vulnerability.Dragos found 9 percent of CVEs in security advisories were more severeaccording to the CVSS calculator3 than reported originally. Note that arise in score should not alarm asset owners as CVSS was not built withindustrial control systems in mind. Proper urgency is better defined withNow, Next, Never prioritization, which is defined more in depth later.After correction, only 1 percent of the advisories had the exact same score.3h t t p s : n v d . n i s t . g o v v u l n \- m e t r i c s c v s s v 3 \- c a l c u l a t o rDragos Frontline PerspectiveDragos predicts the number of vulnerability 
advisories relevant to industrial operations 
will double in the next five years. This 
rapid growth in vulnerabilities is attributed 
to vendors and researchers being more 
focused on OT and because Dragos is 
tracking an increasing number of sources.OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2023VULNERABILITY RISK MITIGATION
Patching every vulnerability is difficult in OT environments and may not improve OT network security. In fact, patchingunnecessarily may bring its own risk unsuccessful patch application may cause unwanted downtime. In addition,many OT devices and software have foreverday vulnerabilities and are insecure by design. This means patching asystem to close a vulnerability may do nothing to improve the security of affected components, as underlying designflaws are still present. A far better approach is to focus remediation and mitigation on items that positively impact theoverall hygiene of the industrial process.Addressing vulnerabilities generally means deploying updates or applying security controls that do not already exist.Patching within an OT environment must be done in a way that ensures that normal, safe operations are maintained.Often, this results in patches being delayed until a maintenance window. For this reason, it is important to have alternatemethods to mitigate vulnerabilities in an advisory.Fast patching can be impractical in ICSOT due to safety \& production 
requirements. Alternative mitigation is key.72%

This is a \+1 percent change from last year for patches and \+1 percent change formitigation advice. Dragos provided mitigations for the 49 percent of the advisories that had no mitigations from anyother source. Advisories with no patch when announced, accounted for 28 percent of all advisories in 2023, and roughly19 percent of those without a patch had no mitigation at all. This leaves OT network defenders without many optionswhen often some of the simplest changes in behavior and tooling can have the most significant impact.30PAPER\-PLANEinfo@dragos.comX\-TWITTER@DragosInclinkedin@Dragos, Inc.OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2023NOW, NEXT, NEVER PRIORITIZATION 
Prioritizing vulnerabilities into actionable categories saves asset owners and operators from wasting time andresources on vulnerabilities with little or no impact on their operations. To prioritize and get from the noise of the 2010vulnerabilities to the signal of the ones you should care about, Dragos follows the Computer Emergency ResponseCoordination Centers (CERTCC) Now, Next, Never methodology.This methodology prioritizes the vulnerabilities that defenders should mitigate immediately and places them in the Nowcategory. Vulnerabilities in the Next category can be mitigated through firewall rules and good network hygiene. Thissecond group could be patched on the next maintenance cycle but should be monitored for abnormal network activity orexploitation. Lastly, vulnerabilities that do not increase the inherent risk of the device fall into the Never category.This prioritization considers if the vulnerability is perimeter\-facing and easily exploitable, like a VPN bypass, a datahistorian that may be used as a pivot point, or other weaknesses in a remote access service. These issues could enablean adversary to obtain access to the network. Prioritization also focuses on the vulnerabilities being actively exploited bythreat groups today. Dragos looks for advisories with a public POC, making the barrier to entry lower to exploit.Another priority must be life\-safety systems. If a vulnerability introduces the capability to modify the logic on a safetysystem, that would belong in the Now category.Using the above as the main criteria for now vulnerabilities,Dragos found that only 3 percent of vulnerabilities analyzed in2023 fell into the Now category.Of the 3 percent, 17 percent aregiven this rating because its on the network edge and 83 percentbecause of the vulnerabilitys capabilities.In 2022, Dragos became a CNA (CVE Number Authority). A benefitof Dragos being a CNA is that it allows Dragos to work closelywith vendors and OEMs to arrive at accurate CVSS scoring, propermitigations, and prioritization without giving vulnerabilities abrand name. CNAs can also ensure that timely information isreleased to end users, especially for design flaws where a vendormay require years to redesign the system and close the flaw.Being a CNA gives the researcher freedom to publish mitigationinformation in these cases.In 2023, 35 of Dragos\-discovered CVEs were publicly disclosed.Eighteen of these CVEs were managed by Dragos as a CNA. Theseincluded primarily network\-facing vulnerabilities that should notnormally be exposed to corporate or internet networks, as wellas several file format vulnerabilities that are likely to disclosecredentials or overwrite files. None were considered Now\-levelvulnerabilities, despite several having Critical CVSS scores.Of the 2010 vulnerabilities in 2023, Dragos 
found that 3 percent required immediate 
action. A full 68 percent can be addressed by 
network monitoring, network segmentation, 
or MFA. And 29 percent require no immediate 
action but should be monitored for signs of 
possible exploitation.Never: No action

VULNERABILITY SEVERITY 
Loss of control and loss of view of the industrial process are among the worstscenarios in an ICS environment. The ability of operations to safely and reliablyoperate a system depends on an accurate view and control of the industrialprocess. Dragos investigates the possible impact of vulnerabilities to helporganizations focus on the most impactful ones.In 2023, 53 percent of the advisories Dragos analyzed vulnerabilities that couldcause both a loss of view and control of the process through a vulnerable OTsystem. This was a shift of \+3 percent from 2022\. A full 46 percent of all thevulnerabilities have no ability to impact the control or visibility of the industrialprocess. Of these vulnerabilities, 1 percent could only cause loss of view withoutimpacting loss of control.WHERE THE VULNERABILITIES RESIDE IN THE NETWORK 
There are different threat profiles for vulnerable assets deep within the ICSnetwork than those at the enterprises border.

Dragos provides expected Purdue levels per advisoryassessment based on common placement in a well\-designedenvironment. In a well\-designed network, adversaries mustcompromise multiple layers before impacting industrialprocesses. This attack path includes gaining initial accessto enterprise networks before pivoting to OT networks tocompromise systems deep within the ICS network. Thismakes the opportunity to exploit vulnerabilities deep withinthe network more challenging.In 2023, 19 percent of these vulnerabilities were remoteaccess vulnerabilities bordering the enterprise, while 80percent resided deep within the ICS network. 62 percentpertains to vulnerabilities found at levels 0 to 3 of the PurdueModel, which should have restricted access, among otherhardening configurations.

VULNERABILITY EXPLOITABILITY
Dragos continually looks for evidence of exploitation in the wild. Asset owners with vulnerable assets actively beingexploited in the wild by adversaries or proven through a penetration test have an increased urgency to mitigate. Becauseof this, exploitation is factored into the Now, Next, Never prioritization.In 2023, 5 percent of advisories included vulnerabilities being actively exploited. Recall that only 3 percent of all advisoriesare given Now priority for remediation active campaigns make up the bulk of the highest priority remediations.Public proof of concepts (PoCs) are examples of exploitation code available for public use. Example code may be specificto a products implementation and configuration, but it is meant to prove the presence of a vulnerability. PoCs can beweaponized as a stand\-alone exploit or incorporated into an exploitation framework. The existence of a PoC lowers thebarrier of entry for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities. Twenty\-three percent of advisories Dragos assessed in 2023 hadpublic PoCs available at the time of disclosure.VULNERABILITY TRENDS 
Dragos observed several vulnerability trends in 2023\.THE RISE OF AUTHENTICATION\-REQUIRED VULNERABILITIES
2023 saw a significant increase in the number of vulnerabilities that require authentication to exploit. Dragos first noticed atrend of high\-profile vulnerabilities, which garnered a large amount of press. These vulnerabilities all had the curious aspectof requiring existing, often administrative access, to the victims device in order for an adversary to achieve any effect.Based on the 2023 data andprior years, a definite surge invulnerabilities is reported, requiringsome authentication.

It is worth noting that while a privilege requirement in a vulnerability is a good thing for defenders, it is not an excuseto label a device secure just because it has a password set. Adversaries can often find ways to obtain credentials, eithervia brute force attacks, social engineering, or simply knowing default credentials for a product.For some systems,authentication may be disabled entirely by the end user, and such a decision will not be reflected in the CVSS score.TREND ANALYSIS BY VULNERABILITY TYPE
Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers play a crucialrole in classifying vulnerabilities, allowing the community to relayvulnerabilities in a shared language. They are assigned to CVEs to describethe underlying cause of the vulnerability. In 2023, Dragos assessed eachvulnerability impacting ICS and found several noteworthy CWEs based ontheir use in the wild.OUT\-OF\-BOUND READWRITE\-CWE\-787CWE\-125Out\-of\-bounds read and write vulnerabilities consistently rank amongthe most exploited and disclosed CWEs year after year. This trend can beattributed to the complexity of developing intricate systems with tens ofthousands of data structures and hundreds of third\-party dependencies.STATISTICSCWE\-787 and CWE\-125 consistently rank at 
the top with the most CVEs, the most public 
proof of concepts, and the most actively 
exploited vulnerabilities reported year over 
year. In 2023 alone, advisories reported 
twelve CVEs related to CWE\-787 that have 
been exploited. This figure surpasses the

A notable case is the TRISISmalware, utilizing an out\-of\-bounds write to compromise a Triconex Safety Instrumented System. Also, this year, itwas discovered that a threat group had developed capabilities around CVE\-2023\-3595\. This particular CVE affected theRockwell Automation 1756 Ethernet modules and was categorized as an out\-of\-bounds write vulnerability.OS COMMAND INJECTION \- CWE\-78STATISTICSImproper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command, also knownas Command Injection, is a security vulnerability that occurs when anapplication does not properly handle user\-supplied data within a commandit executes. In its simplest form, this vulnerability allows an adversary tomanipulate the input in such a way that the application unwittingly executesunintended commands on the system. Adversaries do this by using specialcharacters to break out of the original command and execute additionalcommands.Issues like these are common in networking devices, particularly thoseequipped with network troubleshooting tools like ping. Typically, these toolstake a user\-provided IP address and insert it into a ping command in theunderlying operating system. If the device fails to properly check or validatethis input, a user with malicious intent could input something like 8\.8\.8\.8;catetcpasswd. Without proper validation, the ping tool might execute thecommand ping 8\.8\.8\.8;cat etcpasswd on the operating system, inadvertentlyexposing sensitive information like the password file to the user.To prevent Command Injection vulnerabilities, vendors must employ securecoding practices, including robust input validation and sanitization, usingparameterized queries, and avoiding the direct construction of systemcommands from user input.EXPLOITATIONPalo Alto Networks reported that CVE\-2022\-29303 was used to spread a varietyof the Mirai botnet. This particular CVE impacted the CONTEC SolarViewCompact power monitoring system. This device has a web server that includedan emailing service which did not properly validate the email address providedby the user. Threat groups were able to craft a malicious command injectionrequest that downloaded a variant of Mirai5 on to the device.5M i r a i\-h t t p s : u n i t 4 2 . p a l o a l t o n e t w o r k s . c o m m i r a i \- v a r i a n t \- t a r g e t s \- i o t \- e x p l o i t sIn 2023, OS Command Injection emerged as 
the second most actively exploited CWE, 
maintaining its consistent presence among 
the top three most exploited vulnerabilities 
over the past four years. This persistent 
prevalence can be attributed to a significant 
factor: one\-third of its CVEs over the last four 
years have had public proof of concept. The 
availability of these public proofs of concept 
lowers the bar for exploitation, making OS 
Command Injection an attractive target for 
adversaries. The accessibility of such readily 
available methods reduces the effort required 
for exploitation. For this reason and others, 
Dragos prohibits the public disclosure of any

These accounts typically remain unchangeable, leavingproduct owners with no means to modify them. Attackers discoveror crack these passwords and use them to gain privileged access. InICSOT, this is a common issue since many vendors ship products withmaintenance interfaces that are not mentioned to asset owners.EXPLOITATIONBADOMEN, a PIPEDREAM6malware module designed to targetOmron PLCs, exploited CVE\-2022\-34151\. This CVE is associated withhardcoded credentials and encryption keys statically programmedinto the Sysmac Studio EWS software for communicating with OmronNXNJ PLCs. Likely by reverse engineering Sysmac Studio, the threatgroup CHERNOVITE uncovered these credentials and utilized them todevelop BADOMEN. Later, the same credentials were publicly disclosedwhen a project called ICS Forensics Tools7 was uploaded to Git Huband presented at Black Hat Europe by Microsofts Cyberx researchteam. Thankfully, shortly after the project was uploaded, the modulecontaining CVE\-2022\-34151 was removed.Dragos Frontline PerspectiveDragos found default credentials in 43 percent of 
penetration tests in 2023, yet only 4 percent of 
architecture reviews. This disparity shows that 
default credentials are very common to encounter, yet 
systems owners are often unaware of their presence.Since 2019, the incidence of Hard\-Coded 
Credentials CVEs has demonstrated an 
average annual increase of 133 percent. 
However, a significant shift occurred in 
2023, marking the first year new Hard\-
Coded Credentials CVEs have declined. This 
year, Dragos identified 23 CVEs related to 
hard\-coded credentials, the lowest count 
since 2020 and a substantial decrease from 
the previous years 40 CVEs. This reduction 
is possibly attributable to heightened 
security awareness surrounding these 
vulnerabilities. In addition, many popular 
systems with hard\-coded credentials have 
already been uncovered and disclosed. 
While relatively easy to prevent, the impact 
of hard\-coded credentials vulnerabilities 
is substantial, often leading to highly 
privileged access.Number of advisories containing

Typically, thesevulnerabilities affect web servers and other applications that interactwith the local file system of a device, host, or server. They also frequentlyimpact engineering software, where project files contain file paths as apart of the archive.Exploiting such vulnerabilities often results in adversaries gainingunauthorized access to restricted or unintended areas within the filesystem. These issues typically arise when user input is not properlyvalidated or sanitized when constructing file paths or accessing files onthe file system.For example, consider a web server that serves images at the universalresource locator (URL): https:x.y.zimagesjohndoe.jpeg. An adversarycould craft a malicious URL using escape characters to access sensitivefiles. Its important to note that URL paths are not the only vectors forthese types of attacks. Any process that relies on user input to accessfiles could potentially be vulnerable to path traversal attacks. In additionto this, various techniques, including zipslips9 and universal namingconvention (UNC) path injection, can also be used to exploit pathtraversal vulnerabilities.EXPLOITATIONCVE\-2018\-13379 is a path traversal vulnerability that impacts FortiOS,the operating system used by Fortinets FortiGate Firewall. Dragos hasobserved adversaries conducting exploitation against CVE\-2018\-13379against industrial or ICS entities using Fortinet devices, includingPARISITE and VANADINITE.CVE\-2022\-33971 is a blank CVE covering a number of individual issuesin Omron PLCs, including a path traversal flaw in the embedded webapplication. The BADOMEN tool allows for file listings, retrieval, andoverwrite on the PLC firmware using the file APIs.9Z i pS l i p\-h t t p s : s e c u r i t y. s n y k . i o r e s e a r c h z i p \- s l i p \- v u l n e r a b i l i t yPath traversal remains consistently among 
the most common vulnerabilities year after 
year, averaging 54 CVEs annually over the 
past three years, placing it among the top 
5 most prevalent vulnerabilities. Whats 
particularly concerning is that this CWE\-
22 has become the second most actively 
exploited in 2023, following the use of 
this technique in PIPEDREAM in 2022 and 
against FortiOS by PARISITE in 2019 and 
VANADINITE in 2020, and has consistently 
ranked in the top 5 most exploited CWEs 
since 2020\. Despite this, path traversal 
vulnerabilities are relatively straightforward 
to prevent. By implementing proper user 
input validation, these issues can be entirely 
avoided. In the coming years, efforts to 
address and mitigate this vulnerability type 
will hopefully lead to a positive trend in the 
opposite direction.Number of advisories containing

For an example of the latter: vulnerabilities in engineering software with file formatissues, are almost certainly not observable by Neighborhood Keeperunless the software also broadcasts a very obviousnetwork to identify itself, these vulnerabilities could only be discovered with a more thorough assessment that includesinspecting individual host filesystems.The data does, however, show some interesting characteristics. Specifically: many control systems networks gounpatched for long periods of time. Fully half of the identified vulnerability years are CVEs dating 2016\-2017, meaningthat vulnerabilities patched 6\-7 years prior were extremely prevalent on networks in 2023\.A key takeaway from this analysis is that advisories absolutely must come with alternate mitigation advice: many endusers may fail to apply patches for years after they become available. Indeed, many end users may NEVER apply patches,even when those patches are deemed of critical importance. Thankfully, these end users take other steps to defend thevulnerable components.Looking at Neighborhood Keeper data from different angles: of the vulnerabilities which occurred most frequently inthe Neighborhood Keeper dataset, none were labeled of immediate importance. Of the 493 CVEs that Dragos tracks asNow, meaning that immediate action should be taken by owners to remediate the vulnerability, only 86 are observedon Neighborhood Keeper participant networks. Some of these 86 vulnerabilities are widespread across NeighborhoodKeeper participants.39PAPER\-PLANEinfo@dragos.comX\-TWITTER@DragosInclinkedin@Dragos, Inc.OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2023The prevalence of a vulnerability within the community is part of the analysis that Dragos uses to prioritize exploitationdetection development. That is, some vulnerabilities are likely to go years or decades without patching. When thesevulnerabilities are deemed critical because known threat groups target the component, or because public PoC exploitsare readily available and the observation is made that most users do not apply patches for the vulnerability, then adetection for exploitation becomes much more important.ASSESSING CYBER READINESSIn 2023, we saw major regulatory shifts for critical infrastructure asset owners, resulting in organizations devoting moretime and resources to preparing for a cybersecurity event. This included updates for U.S. pipeline operators in NorthAmerica with TSA Pipeline\-2021\-02D (SD\-02D). In Europe, it was the Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2\);in Australia, the Security of Critical Infrastructure SOCI Act; and, the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC) ECC in theKingdom of Saudi Arabia. One of the most significant changes was not targeted at critical infrastructure but at firmspublicly traded in the U.S.: the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Cybersecurity Risk Management Rules.These rules apply to many OT asset owners, including investor\-owned utilities and manufacturing firms.Dragos observed organizations growing their cybersecurity capabilities, defining or refining processes, and exercisingplans. Organizations leading in this area are shifting from a reactive mindset that leverages break\-glass retainers toa holistic approach for incident response that includes multiple levels within organizations supported by detectioncapabilities, training, and external experts.Developing resiliency is a focal aspect of the 5 Critical2023 Service Engagements with 5CC FindingsControls for OT Cybersecurity.10 Of all Dragos servicesengagements in 2023, 94 percent had a finding relatingto one of these controls.

participants across multiple levels parts of the business. The 
exercise allowed responders, operators, adjacent business 
units, partners, and leadership to practice responding to 
a large\-scale cybersecurity event using incident response, 
business continuity, and crisis management plans. The 
exercise was modeled on threat group activity and capabilities

aWDragos Frontline PerspectiveSEC 8K regulatory requirements have 
become a major theme during most 
exercises involving public companies that 
operate in the United States. Executive 
leadership and boards have taken a more 
active role in managing and governing 
cybersecurity risks.This shift was not perceived equally across industry verticals, but nearly allverticals increased focus on tabletop exercises. The most significant increasewas seen in the electric sector, where the tabletop exercises share of reportsin that sector increased 104 percent year over year. Throughout the industrialspace, teams are shifting focus toward tabletop exercises.Even when regulations dont require organizations to perform exercises,many willingly conduct them to increase awareness and preparedness. Thisis the case with one of the most significant changes in regulation this year:the SEC Cybersecurity Risk Management Rules. The SEC ruling requiresregistrants to disclose an event within four business days after a registrantdetermines that a cybersecurity incident is material. It also requires thatorganizations describe how they will assess, identify, and manage materialrisks from cybersecurity threats and how their boards will provide oversight.Tabletop exercises findings and associated recommendations areorganized by core capabilities for ICSOT cybersecurity readiness andincident response. These are detect, communicate, activate, respond,contain, document, and recover. Core capabilities map to standard incidentresponse processes regardless of whether the organization favors thefour\-step National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) process,SANS Preparation \- Identification \- Containment Eradication \- Recovery\- Lessons Learned (PICERL), or some variation. Regardless of how theincident response plan is structured, these capabilities are needed to handlea cybersecurity event successfully.The core capabilities tested with the lowest aggregate score wasCommunicate, although scores across all capabilities fell in 2023, with theContain capability falling by 19 percent year over year.
