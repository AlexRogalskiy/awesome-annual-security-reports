SurveySANS 2023 CTI Survey: 
Keeping Up with a Changing 
Threat LandscapeWritten by Rebekah Brown and Katie NickelsJuly 20232023 SANS InstituteExecutive SummaryEvents throughout 2022 highlighted the positive impact of cyber threat intelligence (CTI),from informing decisions about major ransomware intrusions to cyber conflict around thewar in Ukraine. With this years survey bringing in the most respondents weve ever had,the diverse feedback from CTI personnel helps highlight areas where CTI as a discipline hasmatured, as well as opportunities where it still must grow. Key insights from this yearssurvey include:Current events and geopolitics significantly influence what CTI personnel focus on,with most respondents reporting that the war in Ukraine has influenced their teamspriorities. CTI personnel frequently rely on external news sources when decidingwhat to prioritize, which can prove both beneficial and challenging.CTI analysts continue to use a range of sources as they consume and produceintelligence, with an emphasis on external over internal sources. Although teamsuse multiple sources, indicators of compromise (IOCs) continue to play a key role insupporting defensive tools and teams.CTI is an increasingly cross\-functional process in many organizations. Examples ofCTI work frequently cite partnerships between CTI teams and other teams within anorganization, including vulnerability management teams, security operations teams,and incident response teams. Although the importance of these partnerships isclear, they arent without challengesinter\-team communication and trust are oftenidentified as hurdles to overcome.Partnerships between CTI vendors and customers are critical, and CTI vendors playa significant role in this discipline. The majority of respondents reported usingexternal CTI service providers in some way. We also see both an increase in thenumber of respondents who work for cybersecurity companies and an increase inthe discussion of specific CTI vendors, products, and tools when describing CTI work.This can be a beneficial relationship to have as long as organizations continue toleverage critical internal threat\-intelligence data and CTI vendors continue to helporganizations know when information is relevant and actionable for them.SANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape2Survey RespondentsThis years survey received feedback from 984 individual respondents in more than 25different industries. More than four times as many individuals responded to this yearssurvey as compared to 2022, allowing us to integrate many more perspectives.

Survey DemographicsSANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape3This year we had several respondentsfrom a new industry not previouslyincluded in our data collection: the waterindustry (including utilities and waste).In October 2021, the Cybersecurity andInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA)released an alert on the ongoing attacksagainst the water sector, highlightingthe critical importance of water servicesand the active threats that the sectorfaces.1 Although we have had surveyrespondents in the past who identifiedthemselves as water and wastewatersector employees, beginning this yearwe are including their responses as oneof the 18 sectors listed in the survey. CTIwork is done across many more fieldsthan those 18, and each year we have many respondents from industry types not listedby default. This year we see a notable increase in the diversity of those fields, includingagriculture, mining, civil engineering, construction, gaming, health and wellness, and law.Figure 2 illustrates some of those various industries represented by the survey respondents.This demonstrates that CTI continues to be a growing field and that organizations ofmany types can benefit from CTI. Recent attacks show that no one particular industryis being targeted; instead, attackers continue to find ways to monetize attacks in nearlyevery vertical. In addition to organizations in these fields benefiting from experienced CTIanalysts, the CTI field itself will gain from the increased diversity of thought, experience, andperspective as analysts work against threats that can impact organizations in unique ways.Another notable change observed in this 2023 survey is that the primary industry ofrespondents is cybersecurity service providers, as compared to 2022 when it was bankingand finance. This notable shift suggests that CTI analysts working for cybersecurity serviceproviders represent a substantial portion of the community. Cybersecurity service vendorsoften approach CTI differently than end\-user organizations such as banks becausethese vendors often have visibility into many organizations while also working to balancerequirements from those many stakeholders.This years respondents were heavily skewed toward the United States, with 71% of theirorganizations being primarily headquartered in the United States, up from 58\.6% of lastyears respondents. Although this is not surprising, its important to note this as a limitationof the survey, because respondents are heavily influenced by their country of operations.Figure 2\. Industries Represented

Theorganization size most commonly represented in this years survey is 101 to 500employees, at 17%, with another 11% representing organizations with fewer than 100employees. This highlights the fact that organizations of all sizes utilize CTI to supporttheir overall security operations, a far cry from the days when CTI was only thought of asuseful to the top 1% of companies.Fifty\-one percent of respondents report that theirorganization has a formal dedicated CTI team, thehighest number we have seen since 2020\. See Figure 3\.Growth in Organizations with Dedicated CTI Teams50%40%41\.5%41\.1%49\.5%44\.4%47\.0%50\.8%Formal dedicated teams often have more bandwidth tofocus on critical CTI processes that can help streamline30%and optimize the work of CTI analysts, and we seereflections of this throughout the survey.

Growth of Formal CTI Teamsanalyst face unique challenges in terms of resources, and small businesses remain at ahigh risk of intrusions because of this. Its encouraging to see that these organizations stillrecognize CTI as an important function within their security staff, because CTI can helpsmall organizations prioritize against the most impactful threats.One primary way organizations supplement these limited in\-house CTI resources isthrough external CTI service providers. A majority of respondents report using externalCTI service providers in some way, with 47% using a combination of in\-house and serviceprovider resources, and 17% exclusively using service providers. Using a combinationof both in\-house and external resources can be a wise choice for many organizations.Such an approach allows external providers to cover widespread threats that affect mostorganizations, while in\-house personnel focus on applying that CTI to their organizationand to unique threats their organization faces.In terms of skill sets and focus areas of those working in the CTI field, the largest groupof respondents identify themselves as security operations and security analysts, at17%, followed by CTI analysts at 15%. This is a significant increase compared to the 2017survey, in which only 6% of respondents identified themselves as dedicated CTI analysts,indicating substantial growth in this career field.SANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape5Requirements and PrioritizationThe first phase of the intelligence cycle is planning and direction, which involves crucialactivities to set up teams for success. A critical part of this phase is defining intelligencerequirementsthe questions or needs an organization has that an intelligence team canseek to support. If teams do not define requirements, they risk producing intelligencethat doesnt support key decisions and that isnt used by consumers. Respondents thisyear clearly recognize the value of requirements, because 59% of them report that CTIrequirements are clearly defined in their organization.This represents a positive change from 2022, in which only35% of respondents reported they had clearly defined CTIrequirements. In fact, this year only 3% or respondentsdo not have requirements and have no plans to createthem, down from 11% in 2022\. Although this change isAre CTI requirements clearly defined in your organization? 2023 2022Yes, we have documented

CTI Requirementsopportunity for growth. Sixty\-nine percent of respondents say the CTI team themselvescontribute to requirements, compared to only 32% of respondents reporting thatexecutives contribute. This presents an opportunity for CTI teams to potentially increaseengagement with executive leadership, a group that has both a need for and a desire forCTI. Looking for additional contributions to CTI requirements beyond just the team itselfpresents an opportunity for teams to expand the value and impact of CTI.Prioritizing requirements and the work the CTI team undertakes is a challenge acrossmany teams. This years responses reveal that the majority of CTI teams spend asignificant amount of time responding to open source reporting from others, includingthreat reports from researchers and cybersecurity news stories. Over half of respondentsnote that they spend more than 40% of their time on this set of activities.When asked how teams determine which CTI tasks to work on and how they prioritizethreats, one respondent offered a clear explanation: Whatever is trending. This responseindicates that analysts and their leadership increasingly hear about cyber threats fromsocial media, blog posts, cybersecurity news, and even mainstream news. Another notedthat their requirements are often overridden when senior management panics aboutsomething and the CTI team is told to prioritize that. This trend isnt surprising giventhe wealth of open source information about cyber threats that constantly inundatesconsumers. However, this also presents an opportunity for CTI teams to try to clarify totheir consumers that topics trending in the news are not always the most impactful totheir organization.SANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape6Many respondents shared more structured approaches to prioritizing their work,which fell under several main categories:Examining assets in their organizations environment and assessing threatpriority based on the risks to those assets\-Example response: We look at known threats in the publicprivate domainand compare them to related software andor vulnerabilities and prioritizethese based on the prevalence of the softwaresystem versus the actualseverity of the vulnerability that may exist within our environment. Whatmay also contribute to the order of addressing such itemsis the fact of any potential compensating control that maytechnically reduce the severity level of the vulnerability ifnot able to patch, etc or havent patched yet.Considering threats that others have reported as impactingthe organizations industryHow important are geopolitics in developing your

When it comes to sources of information gathered by CTIpersonnel, external sources such as commercial or open source threat feeds, news,and social media continue to be more commonly used than internal sources such assecurity event logging and forensics data. Consistent with the pattern that trendingnews is key in prioritizing intelligencerequirements, 69% of respondentsreport external sources such asmedia reports and news as theirprimary information source. Themost commonly used internal sourcethey report is incident responseand forensics data, used by 52% ofrespondents. See Figure 7\.This finding presents an opportunityfor CTI personnel to remindthemselves of the value of internalinformation, particularly fromintrusions. This information canprovide valuable insight, in particularbecause it specifically targeted thatorganization, meaning the threats areguaranteed to be relevant. Despitethe value of internal intrusionanalysis, there are many obstaclesto getting this information, includingthat teams may not want to share itor may not have the resources to fullydocument findings from an intrusion.Following external news sources, thesecond most commonly used sourceamong respondents is communityWhat type of information do you consider to be part of your intelligence gathering?

Information Sourcesor industry groups, such as information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) andComputer Emergency Readiness Teams (CERTs), with 66% of respondents reportinguse of these sources. This finding suggests that these formal groups have a key role indisseminating information to CTI teams, because this source was more popular thanother formal and informal groups used by 41% of respondents.SANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape8Other top sources include threat feeds, including from CTI vendors (used by 66% ofrespondents), open source (61%), and general security vendors (56%). These threat feedsare often made up of IOCs such as hash values, domain names, and IP addresses.One of the most common responses to the open\-ended question about examples ofCTI in action involves indicator use cases. Multiple respondents report that they usecommercial or freely available IOCs to ingest into tools such as security information andevent management (SIEM) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) to determinewhether they are present on their network. This finding shows that even with the riseof tracking tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including with MITRE ATT\&CK,CTI personnel still find value in indicators as a key source. This is likely in part dueto the ease of applying indicators in tools. Although indicators can play a role in CTI,organizations should consider, as their CTI function matures, how they can produce orconsume beyond feeds of IOCs.Producing IntelligenceAfter CTI teams have identified appropriate personnel, established requirements, andcollected information from many sources, they must analyze that information to produceintelligence outputs. Thoughtfully leveraged tools and processes help enable analysts tobe efficient and thorough as they do this. Once intelligence outputs are produced, theirwork isnt done yet; they still need to disseminate those outputs in an accessible way andobtain feedback to refine and improve future products.Production and ConsumptionIt is often said that intelligence is both a processand a product, and CTI is no different. CTI is bothproduced by following intelligence processes and isalso consumed using a different set of processes.Some organizations analyze their own data aboutprevious data breaches or network intrusions andgenerate intelligence products (or reports) based onthat information. They may also generate raw datasuch as lists of IOCs that they can use internallyand also share externally. CTI can also be consumedby organizations that take intelligence provided byexternal sources such as threat\-intelligence vendorsor information\-sharing groups and apply it to theirown internal processes.

Year\-over\-Year CTI Usagecombination of the two types, leveraging their own internal information, as discussedearlier, and also incorporating intelligence generated by others into their securityprocesses. A few organizationsprimarily threat\-intelligence providersonly produceintelligence that is meant to be used by other organizations without consuming othersources of intelligence. See Figure 8\.SANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape9This years survey shows that the highest number of respondents consume intelligenceand that the numbers are rather consistent across the types of information that theyconsume: raw threat data, contextual alerts, and published threat intelligence. Of thosewho produce intelligence, their most common output is raw threat data consumedby other organizations, with 15% of respondents producing this output. This indicateshow the field of threat\-intelligence production has grown over the past few years. In2019, only 5% of respondents exclusively produced raw threat data, and 3% producedpublished threat intelligence. The doubling (and even tripling) of respondents in thisspace demonstrates the growing market for threat intelligence and the growing abilityof vendors in this space to produce intelligence for consumption. Interestingly, asidefrom the increase in production, the balance of those consuming and both consumingand producing has remained relatively consistent over the past few years with oneexception: Nearly 10% fewer organizations exclusively consume published intelligencereports, whereas the number of organizations producing and the number of organizationsboth producing and consuming intelligence reports have both increased, indicating anoverall higher level of reporting available. Not only are there more reports by volume, butthey are being produced by a greater number of organizations, which likely leads to anincrease in the diversity of reporting perspectives and approaches.When we asked respondents to share examples of CTI at work, we can see some of theunique ways that organizations both consume and produce intelligence.ConsumeWe consume threat\-intel data from other third parties in order to evaluate \[our]overall security posture and also used by our threat\-intel and incident\-responseteams to act on potential security breaches.IoCs gathered from events on peersimilarsame region companies shared througha closed group.External threat intel is used to support the prioritization of vulnerabilitymanagement and remediation, primarily as an escalator in cases where intel alignswith vulnerabilities aligns with exposure.ProduceWe produce threat intelligence from our IR practice; we share those findingspublicly.We produce internal intelligence reports from synthesis of external reports,identifying specific areas that are usable for our security operations, such as threatdetection and threat\-hunting opportunities.SANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape10ToolsAs teams are producing and consuming CTI, various categories of tools can help thembe successful and efficient. As they have for several years, spreadsheets reign supremewhen it comes to tools used to aggregate and analyze CTI information, with 71% ofrespondents using them. This highlights that a simple spreadsheet remains a powerfuland cost\-effective way to help analysts organize information, even with the availabilityof CTI\-specific tools. The second\-ranked tool (59%) behind spreadsheets was a SIEM orother security analytics platform, demonstrating that CTI personnel are making use oftools that are likely already in their environment for use by other security operationsteams. Open source threat\-intelligence platforms (TIPs) ranked third, with 48% ofrespondents using these TIPs.Analytic ProcessesWith an increase in production of intelligence, it is important to pay attention to boththe sources being used, as discussed earlier, and the analytic processes being used. Thisis the second year that we have asked survey respondents to share some informationabout the processes and techniques that they use when conducting analysis. We askedrespondents about five different methods they commonly use in intelligence analysis andasked whether they use those methodsfrequently, occasionally, or never. Themost commonly used method is intuitiveor judgment\-based analysis, followed veryclosely by threat modeling, and then theuse of conceptual models such as theDiamond Model or Kill Chain. See Figure 9\.In both 2022 and 2023, respondentsand experience\-based judgment mostheavily, with nearly half of respondentsusing this method frequently.

The good thing is that most analystsdo not exclusively rely on experience; they pair that beneficial experience with othermethods of analysis to counter biases and use their intuition as a starting point ratherthan the entire process. In the past year, we have seen significant jumps in the number ofpeople reporting that in addition to experience\-based judgments they also frequently useconceptual models, structured analytic techniques (SATs), and inductive reasoninggraph\-
driven analysis.3 Most notable is the increase in those who frequently leverage SATs, whichare methods specifically designed to counteract cognitive bias in analysis. In 2022, only19% reported that they frequently use SATs in analysis. In 2023, that number has jumpedto over 30%!3There Is MOAR To Structured Analytic Techniques Than Just ACH! SANS CTI Summit 2018, https:www.youtube.comwatch?v\=PtYWVzY2VesSANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape11Dissemination and FeedbackOnce CTI has been producedwhether this production was done by a third\-party partner,a vendor, or the CTI team itselfit needs to get to the right people or systems at the righttime to enable them to make the best use of the intelligence. Another critical componentof the dissemination process is gathering feedback to make sure that the intelligencebenefited the organization. If it is not helping improve security or helping defenders makemore insightful decisions, then something about the CTI process needs to be adjusted.Organizations should approach dissemination and feedback intentionally as a critical partof the intelligence process.Dissemination MethodsAll the methods we asked about in the surveyemails, integrations withthreat intelligence platforms, reports, and briefingsare each used byover 50% of respondents. This indicates that CTI personnel have to beprepared to disseminate information in different formats based on thegoals and the audience. Several respondents described using both writtenreports and in\-person or remote briefings for security\-education andsecurity\-awareness purposes. The same content that organizations canuse for security\-awareness briefingsfor example, a change in tactics inphishing campaignslikely also has indicators that they can disseminateto security tools via a threat\-intelligence platform, doubling the impact ofthe same threat\-intelligence content.Impact of CTIA Note on RFIsThis year some respondents pointed out that it 
isnt always the threat\-intelligence team pushing 
information out to others. Sometimes other groups 
within an organization reach out to CTI teams with 
requests for information (RFIs). Responding to RFIs 
is a great way not only to provide information to 
the organization, but also for CTI teams to learn 
more about which types of information are helpful 
to others in the organization, which they can then 
use to generate future intelligence requirements. 
In fact, RFIs represent a type of feedback on what 
organizations find valuable.As previously mentioned, gathering feedback is one of the best ways to ensure that CTIis benefiting an organization. This holds true whether you are an in\-house CTI teamor individual or are part of a CTI team in a cybersecurity organization that providesintelligence to multiple partners. This year, 50% of respondents indicate that they measurethe effectiveness of their CTI programs, and87% report that CTI has helped to improvesecurity prevention, detection, and response.Of those who measure the effectiveness oftheir programs, the most common methodsof measurement are first automated and thenmanual tracking of actions that they take basedoff of CTI. Many also use the time it takes torespond to an alert or incident as a measureof impact. Although CTI might not be able toprevent all incidents, it can help reduce the timeit takes to respond to an issue. Interestingly, only23% get feedback directly from customers as amethod of measuring impact. See Figure 10\.What methods do you use to measure the effectiveness of CTI?

How did ournotificationreport result in actions taken to improve security and reducerisk for our customers? How did our actionable information result in timelyactions and decisions?\[We] meet regularly with consumers to discuss feedback from CT intel andcollaborate on what is working, what needs improvement, what they wouldlike to see.Feedback from customers about effectiveness of defensive measures takenon the basis of \[CTI].Gathering feedback, directly or indirectly, provides a great way to understand theimpact of CTI and identify ways to improve or optimize the support being providedto other teams.Challenges and LimitationsThis years survey highlights many ways that the CTI field continues to grow inmaturity and capabilities, which we see from things such as an increase in thenumber of organizations with formal anddocumented intelligence requirements, thenumber of organizations with dedicatedCTI teams, and an increase in the analyticmethods organizations use to generate CTI.When it comes to challenges, we also seea decrease in challenges reported acrossthe board. Although all these indicationsare promising, many organizations still facesignificant challenges when it comes to CTI.Survey respondents cite a number of areasthat currently hold them back, including aWhat inhibits your organization from implementing CTI effectively?

CTI ChallengesSANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape13Lack of trained staff is a commonly cited challenge in the CTI space. Although we seemany signs that the CTI field continues to mature, it is still a relatively new field incybersecurity, and the growth of CTI teams can often outpace the training pipeline. In 2022,57% of organizations listed lack of trained staff as their number one challenge. This year,although staffing still remains the top challenge, that number has dropped down to 44%of organizations. Many great resources are available for those looking to get into the CTIfield or those in other cybersecurity jobs who are interested in learning more about CTI. Toget started, check out these blogs:Cyber Threat Intelligence Self\-Study PlanPart I4Cyber Threat Intelligence Self\-Study PlanPart II5CTI Reading List6SANS CTI Summit Presentations7Despite the reduction in the number of challenges CTI teams face, lack of automationremains a hurdle to many and is the second most prevalent challenge experiencedby CTI personnel. This area has grown steadily since 2017 and peaked in 2022\. We canattribute the decrease of more than 10% to the rise in cybersecurity vendors providingthreat\-intelligence support, with many usingtheir own platforms and tools as part oftheir processes. An improvement in thesetools would have a significant impact onthe overall industry, and many teams whostruggle to optimize their workflows wouldwelcome the change. See Figure 12\.Many of these challenges are ones wehave been tracking through this survey foryears, but we are always on the lookoutfor new challenges and limitations facingCTI personnel.

Youread about the importance of feedback in earlier sections as it relates to developingrequirements and measuring impact, but it can also prove helpful for establishing trustrelationships and showing the value of increased collaboration.4https:medium.comkaties\-five\-centsa\-cyber\-threat\-intelligence\-self\-study\-plan\-part\-1\-968b5a8daf9a5https:medium.comkaties\-five\-centsa\-cyber\-threat\-intelligence\-self\-study\-plan\-part\-2\-d04b7a529d366https:sroberts.medium.comcti\-reading\-list\-a93ccdd7469c7https:www.sans.orgpresentationsSANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape14In coming years, as CTI continues to evolve and as threat actors and technologiesadvance, we will continue to look for challenges facing CTI teams. One challenge thatbecame apparent, beyond the survey questions addressing challenges themselves, isthe increasing difficulty CTI analysts face because of the growing volume of open sourcereporting. Over 60% of survey respondents wrote that they spend more than half of theirtime responding to open source reporting, including threat reports from researchers andcybersecurity news stories. In addition, in the past few years, media reporting has becomeone of the top sources of information that CTI personnel consume. This focus on reportsand the subsequent need to respond to the many questions they raise is an area wherethe CTI field could benefit from additional best practices and processes, especially when itcomes to the potential risks of disinformation.Moving ForwardCTI analysts will continue to face demands from various stakeholders, whether those areleaders asking about the latest cybersecurity news or incident responders requesting helpto understand a threats lateral movement. Organizations can use many of the responsesfrom this years survey to help them prioritize requirements as they move forward.Recommendations to aid with the challenging task of prioritization include:Understand the organizations assets, software, infrastructure, and information tohelp focus on threats most likely to affect those.Include multiple stakeholders in the CTI requirement prioritization process toensure the team doesnt focus solely on what the CTI team thinks is important.Recognize that CTI analysts cannot address all needs and limit prioritizedrequirements based on the number of personnel allocated. For many teams, limitingcore requirements to no more than 310 requirements may be appropriate.Developments around the world will continue to influence CTI, whether in the formof geopolitical conflict or new malware. As this years survey reveals, world eventssometimes consume a significant portion of CTI resources, which could result inorganizations deprioritizing other valuable sources. CTI teams should strive to strike abalance between using external news as a source and incorporating internal intrusionanalysis as well. Although finding the right role for so\-called current intelligence isnteasy, CTI personnel might consider providing a single product line focused on externalnews as one approach while ensuring that other products focus on a broader range ofsources than just external ones.CTI will remain a potent force to help teams combat cyber threats and to empowerstakeholders of all types in their decision making. As the field continues to grow andevolve, we expect to witness even more maturity in people, processes, and technology asCTI personnel tackle fresh challenges and address new areas of need.SANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape15SponsorsSANS would like to thank this surveys sponsors:SANS 2023 CTI Survey: Keeping Up with a Changing Threat Landscape16
