Threat 
MonitorAnnual Report 2023nccgroup.com 1FOREWORDIn this years Annual Cyber Threat Monitor 
Report, we take a look back at the key events 
that shaped the cyber threat landscape in 
2023, as well as looking ahead at the year to 
come, sharing insights from our Cyber Threat 
Intelligence team here at NCC Group.2023 appeared to show signs that the 
international community beginning to take the 
threats from cyber adversaries more seriously.We saw several examples of coordinated law 
enforcement action against criminal groups 
including key ransomware operators and 
individuals believed to be acting on behalf of 
foreign intelligence services. There was also 
consensus on the issue of ransomware, in that 
governments around the world have showed 
a united front against ransom payments and 
intelligence sharing through The International 
Counter Ransomware Initiative, which 
introduced several measures that offer a real 
opportunity to fight back against the pervasive 
threat from ransomware operators.However, despite this, we saw the highest 
volume of ransomware victims NCC Group 
has ever recorded with an 84% increase in 
2023 alone. The sheer volume of attacks 
and different types of victims proves that no 
organisation is safe.Notably, ransomware operators employed 
new and innovative techniques to maximize 
their profits, targeting big software creators 
and managed service providers. So, even if 
an organisation does not perceive a direct 
threat from ransomware, it should consider the 
potential impact on its supply chain.The ongoing threat to critical national 
infrastructure across the globe by hacktivists 
and Foreign Intelligence Services continued in 
2023, following on from multiple geo\-political 
conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, 
and Asia. National Cyber Security Centres in 
multiple countries have highlighted this threat 
and it is something we are monitoring as a 
priority moving in to 2024\.With those few things in mind, here we give 
further insight into what was a challenging 2023, 
and what organistions should be focusing on in 
the year ahead.Matt HullGlobal Head of

Ransomware
Royal Mail attackRoyal Mail suffered 6 weeks of disruption 
to international postal services, affecting 
11,500 Post Office branches.This was due to a LockBit affiliate driven 
ransomware attack, with Royal Mail 
refusing to pay the ransom.30th Jan 
Hacktivism
Killnet targets NATO countries 
supporting Ukraine
Pro\-Russian Hacktivist group, Killnet, 
launched DDoS attacks against US 
healthcare organisations and public 
healthcare sectors.This followed claims the group 
had successfully compromised US 
Healthcare organisations. The motivation 
is believed to be the retaliation against 
countries in support of Ukraine, with 
DDoS attacks also focused on other 
NATO countries.7th Mar
Malware
Emotet returns with new 
evasion techniques
Emotet was observed returning after 
a period of hiatus, with new evasion 
techniques, allowing it to continue to 
send malicious spam to victims, as 
well as steal credentials and email 
addresses, whilst enabling lateral 
movement and download further 
malware.It has been observed being used by 
Ransomware groups to distribute their 
ransomware payloads.SECTION 01CRITICAL EVENTS

Ransomware
GoAnywhere MFT Zero\-Day 
exploited by CL0P
Remote Code Injection flaw, CVE\-
2023\-0669, on exposed administrative 
consoles of GoAnywhere secure web file 
transfer solution was shared by Fortra.Reports at the time indicated that it had 
been actively exploited by threat actors, 
and later shown to be the case that 
CL0P ransomware group was using this 
flaw in a spate of ransomware attacks.14th Mar

targets EU diplomatic entities 
and systemsNobelium, aka APT29 and Cozy 
Bear, targeted European diplomatic 
missions and systems sharing 
sensitive political information, aiding 
the Ukrainian government, and 
helping Ukrainian citizens flee.This group is affiliated with the 
Foreign Intelligence Service of the 
Russian Federation (FVR) and was 
targeting Polish representatives 
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

to gather useful intelligence.8th Aug
Police Force: Data Leak 
FOI request leads to acci\-
dental PII data leakIn response to a Freedom of 
Information (FOI) request made to the 
Police Service of Northern Ireland, a 
spreadsheet detailing the locations 
and names of serving employees was 
mistakenly made public and posted 
online, putting these employees at 
risk.Police forces in Norfolk and Suffolk 
also confirmed FOI requests led 
to inadvertently sharing too much 
Personally Identifiable Information 
(PII) publicly, whilst Cumbria 
Police blamed human error for the 
publication of the names and salaries 
of all its officers online.23rd May
Barracuda
Zero Day Vulnerability

vulnerability in their Email Security 
Gateway, CVE\-2023\-2868, which 
had been exploited in the wild, 
the threat actor believed to be the 
Chinese state affiliated UNC4841, 
leveraging the flaw for espionage.The threat actor quickly adapted 
to containment and remediation 
efforts, leaving Barracuda to take 
the unusual step of recommending 
customers replace their existing 
appliances with new ones, rather 
than rely on more typical remediation 
efforts.29th Mar
Supply Chain Attack

expected to be responsible for the 
compromise, which was used to 
go on to comprise 3CX customers 
critical infrastructure organisations 
within the energy sector.A trojanised version of the legitimate 
3CX software was used to 
compromise their customers. What 
set this attack apart is that the attack 
was the result of an earlier supply 
chain attack, with a 3CX employee 
downloading malware infected 
software package.31st May

by Russian threat actorsPrint Management Software maker, 
Papercut, announced Remote Code 
Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in 
Papercut NG and Papercut MF, 
which could be levered without 
authentication in this critically rated 
CVE. A user account data flaw affecting 
Papercut NG and Papercut MF was 
also discovered, and both were 
known to be exploited by threat 
actors. Papercut has 100\+ million 
customers worldwide. Groups such 
as LockBit then leveraged this flaw in 
ransomware attacks.31st Aug

Dual Ransomware AdvisoryThe US Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) shared a 
Private Industry alert warning of an 
increasing trend of dual ransomware, 
where victims were targeted with 
more than one ransomware attack in 
close succession, with threat actors 
using different types of ransomware 
in each instance.Also noted was an increased use 
of wiper malware to destroy data, 
amongst other tactics to pressure 
victims to pay ransom.27th Sept

Hamas attack on IsraelPalestinian group, Hamas, officially 
designated in many countries as a 
terrorist organisation, launched an 
armed assault against Israel.1,200 civilians were killed in the 
attacks making this one of the 
deadliest attack in Israels history. 
Hostages were also taken. 2 
days later, the Israeli government 
announced a complete siege of 
Gaza, as a result of which over 
23,000 Palestinians have since been 
killed.12th Oct
Ransomware
MGM CasinoMGM shared details of a 
ransomware attack, which included 
the theft of customer data, and cost 
to the business in the region of $US 
100,000,000\.BlackCat, aka AlphV subgroup of 
Scattered Spider, took responsibility 
for the attack, in which the casino 
refused to pay the ransom.10th Oct
23andMe: Data Breach 
Genetic Company hacked, 
and genetic ancestry data 
leakedA successful credential stuffing attack 
allowed a threat actor to directly access 
14,000 23andMe customer records, 
stealing genetic ancestry information 
and, in some cases, health related detail 
based on the genetics. Some of the 
stolen detail was leaked online and the 
criminals offered the records for sale, 
putting at risk particular groups.Using the access to these accounts 
allowed the threat actor to pivot from 
there to scrape some detail from 6\.9 
million customers.12th Dec
Hack
Kyivstar Telco company 
disclosed records destroyed 
by Russian state affiliated 
TARussian threat actor, Sandstorm, 
believed responsible for an attack 
which disrupted Ukraines largest 
mobile network operator so severely, 
that its customer base of half the 
population of Ukraine was left without 
services for days.This also meant they would not 
receive alerts warning of Russian 
attacks, therefore endangering 
life. The attack wiped out almost 
everything, leaving infrastructure 
decimated. 9

OF NOTEHybrid Warfare: Gaza conflictThroughout the year, the Russia and Ukraine conflict continued. However, the 7th October 2023 saw the Islamic Re\-sistance Movement (Hamas) launch a surprise military operation against Israel. The cyber threat landscape has seenan interesting mirroring of the Russia\-Ukraine conflict with hacktivism at the forefront of the cyber threat.Mostly targeted against Israeli infrastructure, the activity has typically impacted the Availability vector of the CIA triadthrough Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Furthermore, for the greatest impact, adversaries have been targeting Crit\-ical National Infrastructure sectors such as Energy and Defence, Telecommunications and Government to have thelargest impact for their respective side.The adversarial groups have also had a keen interest and relative success rate with specific targeting of IndustrialControl Systems (ICS), in particularly SCADA.Companies targeted through digital supplySupply chains continue to be breached:chain: File sharing platforms targetedCapita BreachThroughout 2023, file sharing platforms wereIn March 2023, Capita, an outsourcing companyexploited across the globe to compromisesuffered a data breach which impacted 90organisations using them for data extortion andorganisations.ransomware attacks.Fortras GoAnywhere MFT software was targetedMicrosoft 365 applications and had Black Bastaearly in the year through a zero\-day vulnerabilityransomware deployed to 0\.1% of their server estate.tracked as CVE\-2023\-0669, which leveraged remotecommand execution to deploy ransomware to theThis was reduced due to the intervention of Capita toCapita suffered an unauthorised intrusion into theiruserbase.stop movement.

The group claimed to have 35TB of sensitivedata.The re\-encryption happened just as the companygot back to operating capabilities, so this was abig setback for the company and caused a lackof availability for its applications and ecommerceplatform which triggered another two weeksof operational disruption.This breach included35,000,000 records.Ransomware halted physical delivery: Royal Mail hit 
by LockBitIn January, Royal Mail discovered a cyberattack which haltedtheir international shipping services due to what they referred toas, severe service disruption.It later surfaced that the threat group responsible for the attackwas LockBit, who announced their role in a post publishedon a Russian\-speaking hacking site. Royal Mail were able tore\-establish most of their international shipping services by the3rd of February on Twitter, and declared that they were fullyoperational on the 21st of February 2023\.On the 23rd of February, LockBit leaked 44GB of data stolenfrom Royal Mail, as they refused to pay the 66 million ransomdue to it being an absurd amount of money.The leaked data included files relating to various parts of RoyalMails businesstechnical information, contracts with third\-party suppliers, human resource and staff disciplinary records,details of salaries and overtime payments, and even one staffmembers Covid\-19 vaccination records.The ransom has since lowered to 33m, but Royal Mail haveshown no signs of giving in to the threat groups demands.This is an excellent example of the real\-world implications ofcybercrime, notably where operational disruption is concerned,with the impact extending beyond the victim itself. UK residentswere forced to use alternative shipping solutions for theirinternational exports, also highlighting the impact on customerconfidence.12 13

INTERVENTIONSTrickBot:Trickbot is a banking trojan which started off as a derivative of the Dyre banking trojan in 2016 before evolvingindependent features which turned it into a flexible and modular piece of malware, enabling cybercriminals to deploymultiple payloads including malware.Joint sanctions between the United Kingdom and the United States were levied against 11 named individuals believedto have been involved in the development of the TrickBot trojan. Additionally, two individuals have been arrestedand faced charges relating to their involvement with the banking trojan, a Latvian national, Alla Witte, plead guilty toconspiracy to commit computer fraud for their involvement with the group, and in June 2023 was sentenced to 32months imprisonment.Additionally, Russian national Vladimir Dunaev, was arrested in South Korea in September 2021 and was extradited tothe United States; he plead guilty to committing computer fraud and identity theft as well as conspiracy to commit wirefraud and bank fraud, and faces up to a maximum of 35 years in prison upon his scheduled sentencing on 20 March2024\.Sanctions against North Korea:In May, the US Treasury Departments Office ofworker operations threaten international securityby financing the DPRK regime and its dangerousactivities, including its unlawful weapons of massForeign Assets Control (OFAC) levied sanctionsdestruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs.against four corporate, government, and academicentities as well as one individual for theirinvolvement in international fraud for the purposes ofraising funds for the North Korean regime.Thousands of workers hide their identity to be hiredas IT professionals overseas in order to generaterevenue for the government through receivingforeign salaries and funnelling them back toPyongyang.BreachForums and PompompurinUS authorities in March arrested the threat actorresponsible for successfully hacking the FBI in 2021\.Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, known online by his aliasPompompurin, and is also connected to the FBIsInfraGard network breach in 2022, the 2022 Twitterdata leak, the 2021 Robinhood hack, as well asbeing the owner of BreachForums.Some of these workers receive salaries in excess ofa quarter of a million dollars, and while this may notbe applicable for every one of the illicit IT workers,the economy of scale through utilising thousands ofBreachForums rose to take the place of RaidForumsafter its own takedown at the hands of the FBI in2022 and has been host to such data as PII ofroughly 170,000 individuals affected by the DCagents means the Kim regime is able to generateHealth Link breach in March 2023\.significant funds.US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, summarisesthe issue as:The DPRK conducts malicious cyber activitiesand deploys information technology (IT) workersabroad who fraudulently obtain employment togenerate revenue that supports the Kim regime. . .

 176,500 arrests plus nearly a billion seizedFollowing its initial compromise by European law enforcementagencies in 2020, further efforts have targeted the userbase ofEncroChat.The encrypted communications platform which ran on aspecially hardened version of the Android operating systemoffered users self\-destruct features, panic wipe capabilities, 247customer support, and more for a one\-time payment of 1,000and 1,500 for a 6 month subscription.More than 6,500 arrests have since been made, including of 197high\-value targets. This was done through analysing over 100million conversations between approximately 60,000 users ofthe platform.Through utilising this data, law enforcement agencies acrossEurope were able, in addition to the thousands of arrests,seize 270 tons of narcotics, 971 vehicles, 271 properties, 923weapons, 68 explosives, 40 planes, 83 boats, as well as 740million in cash in addition to freezing a further 154 million.Europol states that a third of EncroChat users were members oforganised crime groups, a third were drug traffickers, while therest were included money launderers, murderers, and firearmstraffickers.This campaign sent shockwaves through OCGs (OrganisedCriminal Groups) across Europe, and further highlighted theintersection between conventional criminal activity and cyber\-enabled crimes.Man indicted after acting as malicious insider againstwater treatment facilityJuly saw the indictment Rambler Gallo, a former employee of aMassachusetts based company operating at the Discovery BayWater Treatment Facility in California, after his alleged attack onthe facility in January 2021\.Gallo, the former Instrumentation and Control Tech at the facility,is alleged to have installed software on his own private computeras well on the private internal network of his employer, and,upon resignation from the company in January 2021, exploitinghis remote access to uninstall software which was the mainhub of the network and which was responsible for protectingthe entire water treatment system including filtration, chemicallevels, and water pressure.He faces up to 10 years behind bars and up to $240k forthe charge of transmitting a program, information, code, andcommand to cause damage to a protected computer, in violationof 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(5\)(A) and (c)(4\)(B)(i).This Discovery Bay facility attack, as well as the similar attackon the water system of Oldsmar in early 2021, likely contributedto the March 2023 decision of the Biden administration to makethe conducting of cyber security audits on public water systemsmandatory.18 
18 19SECTION 04INCIDENT RESPONSE 
FINDINGSOur Incident Response data represents cases handled by our CIRT Team when respondingto NCC clients. In 2023, the Financials sector observed the greatest percentage of incidentsraised (15%), closely followed by Industrials (14%) and Government (14%).This reflected a shift in the top\-three targeted sectors in 2022, from Government (18%),Industrials and Financials in joint second (13%) and Technology and Consumer Cyclicals(11%) in joint third.Over the last two years, the data suggests that Financials and Industrials remain ofconsistent interest to threat actors, with a growth of 2% in incident response cases for theFinancials sector between 2022 and 2023\.This is likely a combination of the potential for financial gain understood by cybercriminalswhere targeting these sectors successfully, as well as the continued need for sufficientcyber security hygiene to combat ever growing cyber threats.20 21Figure 1:Percentage of CIRT Cases by Sectors ImpactedAnalysis of attack categories found that most incidents concerned Unauthorised Access(36%), Phishing (16%) and Malicious Code (15%).Where the top\-targeted sector was concerned, Financials, most attacks were related toUnauthorised Access (5%) and Phishing (5%).Remaining aware of possible signs of authorised access such as unusual activity ondevices, as well as ensuring appropriate phishing training and awareness can supportorganisations to prevent or minimise potential attacks.Figure 2: CIRT Cases by Attack Type 202322 23

FINDINGSData collated from our Global Security Operations Centre (SOC) reported 3493 true positive incidents acrossthe European and APAC SOCs. 2023 saw a 36% increase from the 2559 true positive cases observed in2022, reflecting a growth in the number of tickets raised across NCC Groups client base.This may also be in line with a growth in NCCs clientele, amounting to a greater number of incidents overalland not necessarily a growth in global security incidents. Regardless, in this section we will dive into thedataset to better understand the course of events throughout the year.Figure 3: Month\-by\-Month Count of Incidents Raised in the SOC (2023\)July recorded the greatest number of tickets raisedAs seen in Figure 3, we observe a much steadierwith 356 in total, followed by November in secondflow of tickets raised in 2023 for the period January place with 336\.June.
