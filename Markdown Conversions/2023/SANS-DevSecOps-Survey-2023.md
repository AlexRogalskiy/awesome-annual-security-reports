DevSecOps SurveyWritten by Ben Allen and Chris EdmundsonAugust 20232023 SANS InstituteExecutive SummaryDevSecOps represents the intersection of software development (Dev), security (Sec),and operations (Ops) with the fundamental objective of automating, monitoring, andintegrating security throughout all phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC):plan, develop, build, test, release, deliver, deploy, operate, and monitor. Ultimately,DevSecOps is fundamentally concerned with enabling agility, which inevitably brings withit the challenges that come with sharing the responsibility for security best practices withother stakeholders across the entire continuous integrationcontinuous deployment(CICD) pipeline. Achieving this shared\-responsibilityideal requires the development of trusted relationshipsKey Findingsamong development, security, and operations teams.The trend toward organizations leveraging multiple cloudThe 2023 DevSecOps Surveythe 10th in an annualseriesconsiders a broad range of indicators ofmaturity in these areas and evaluates them against aretrospective view of previous years survey responses,with the goal of helping security practitionersunderstand:How organizations use cloud platforms,architectures, and development ecosystemsto identify security requirements, risks, andopportunitiesHow organizations deploy appropriate securitywithin the CICD pipeline, injecting security bestpractices while keeping up with the delivery ofsolutions continues, as indicated by the respondents using 
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud 
Platform (GCP) to run more than 75% of their application 
workloads. Forty\-seven percent of the respondents said they use 
other cloud hosting providers, including Alibaba Cloud, IBM Cloud, 
and Oracle Clouda dramatic increase from just 25% last year.A key DevSecOps challenge remains the difficulty of acquiringthe necessary funding to purchase newly available security and 
testing tools.The key success factors the survey respondents identified 
show the importance organizations continue to place on 
communications within the organization and creating security 
champions through professional development activities.Cloud\-hosted virtual machines (VMs) are still preferred overcontainers and serverless functions, with 69% of respondents 
reporting at least 25% of their applications running on VMs.products and features to stakeholdersAnother interesting trend this year is that DevSecOps is nowWhat security tools and best practicesorganizations leverage to maintain a shift\-leftmentalityto keep security in mind continuouslythroughout the development processWhat skills are needed to empower organizationsto architect secure applications and cloud servicesand help them find and fix vulnerabilities as earlyas possibleWhat are the future trends and adoption rates ofnew technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI),data science, and GitOpsand how they mightimpact the future of DevSecOpsclearly seen as a business\-critical issue and a risk management 
concern. Forty percent of the respondents were aligned with the 
business side, and 13% of respondents identified themselves as 
business managers.The dominant industries represented by the respondents aligned 
with the technology, cybersecurity, and application development 
verticals. Representation from the banking and finance industry 
shows a significant decline (down from 17% in 2022 to 7% in 2023\), 
and several key industriesnotably government and healthcare
appear to be underrepresented, as they have been in past years.One of the notable forward\-looking trends shown by the 2023surveyreflecting industrywide trendsis a significant increase 
(16%) in respondents reporting that they were investigating 
and experimenting with the use of AI or data science to improve 
DevSecOps, up from 33% in 2022 to 49% in 2023\.SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey2A Snapshot of the RespondentsThe 363 respondents to this years survey represent a highly diverse set of roles,industries, and organizational sizes (see Figure 1\). Unsurprisingly, they show a strong biastoward security, with 34% of respondents performing a direct security function of somekind. Security administratorsecurity analyst is by far the most common role, at 10\.2%.Development rolesincluding application developer, cloud architect, software engineer,and DevOps engineerare, of course, also well represented, at 21%. But the single mostrepresented role in the survey is business manager, at 13% of the respondents, clearlyshowing that DevSecOps is now broadly recognized as a business concern, not solely atechnical issue. Management and executive roles, including the business manager role,comprise 40% of the respondents (including security and compliance managers, qualityanalysis \[QA] release managers, CxOs, and IT managersdirectors).Top 4 Industries RepresentedOrganizational SizeTechnologyCybersecurityApplication

Small organizationsdefined as those with 1,000 or fewer full\-time and contract employeesdominate the survey,with a total of 61% of the respondents. Larger organizations are distributed relatively evenlyacross the other organizational\-size categories. Additionally, this may also suggest thatorganizations are outsourcing their development resources.The United States is disproportionately represented in terms of geography, with 74%of respondents primary corporate headquarters located there and 84% of operationsmaintained there. Canada and Europe followed at a far\-distant second and third, at 6% and5% of corporate headquarters and 28% and 25% of operations, respectively.Understanding the DevSecOps EnvironmentThis years survey, like the previous years, shows adoption and use of cloud computingas an IT delivery model continuing to accelerate dramatically. This year, for example,only 54% of respondents reported that their organizations run 25% or more of theirapplications on\-premises, down from 65% in 2022 and 85% in 2021a 31% drop in justthree years (see Figure 2\). Moreover, fewer than 5% of respondents indicated that theyran all their applications on\-premises, while almost 7% said they have no on\-premisesapplications at all, and more than 84% of the survey respondents reported at least somedegree of cloud usage.What percentage of your applications are running in the following methods? 0% 124% 2549% 5074% 7599% 100%50%40%30%20%35\.0%25\.1%16\.5%42\.7%22\.8%16\.8%10%6\.8%7\.7%4\.6%5\.1%5\.7%4\.0%7\.4%29\.9%30\.5%17\.9%32\.2%27\.9%14\.5%14\.8%14\.2%14\.0% 14\.8%10\.5%7\.4%3\.1%7\.4%2\.8%2\.8% 2\.0%0%On\-premisesCloud\-hosted

Platforms for ApplicationsThese results clearly show that the shift to the cloud is ongoing (and almost certain tocontinue). But the survey results also offer an important reminder that not all applicationsare based in the cloud. Overall, a still very substantial 29% of the respondents reported that50% or more of their applications remain on\-premises.A closer look at the cloud responses shows that, as in previous years, cloud\-hosted VMsare still preferred over cloud\-hosted container services or cloud\-hosted functions\-as\-a\-service (FaaS, also called serverless computing)but also that most organizationscloud implementations remain highly diverse. In this years survey, although 69% of therespondents said that at least 25% of their applications run on VMs, 59% use cloud\-hostedcontainer services for the same percentage of their applications and 57% use FaaS.SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey4This mix of VMs, containers, and FaaS has important securityimplications, because all three of these technologies must beTAKEAWAYproperly secured. That means DevSecOps teams must havethe skills and tooling to secure all three approacheswhich,despite considerable overlap, are all distinctly different. A furtherconsideration is that an enterprise using the cloud can likelydelegate some mundane security tasks to its cloud serviceproviderfreeing up its own personnel for more importanthigher\-level dutiesbut this is not the case with on\-premisesapplications. This suggests that organizations using the cloudshould look to providers that are prepared to take on moresecurity management responsibilities.DevSecOps teams need to invest in tools that make it 
possible to secure their workloads effectively, wherever 
they run. Software composition analysis (SCA), static 
application security testing (SAST), dynamic application 
security testing (DAST), and threat modeling tools, for 
example, can all be used to improve the security of long\-
lived VMs and short\-lived containers or functions. When 
selecting tools, security practitioners must recognize that 
different runtime environments need different tools and 
must consider whether cloud providersboth current and 
prospectivehave tools integrated into their ecosystems 
that could potentially streamline security workflows.Application Hosting in the CloudThe survey results clearly show that most organizations using the cloud are engaging withmultiple cloud service providers and that the distribution of applications running on eachof the three most important cloud service providers is beginning to even out.For the more than 84% of respondents who reported using the cloud:90% have applications running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).84% have applications running on Microsoft Azure.74% have applications running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).Moreover, 47% said they use other cloud hosting providers, including Alibaba Cloud,IBM Cloud, and Oracle Clouda dramatic increase from just 25% last year.Another important finding is the clear trend away from using a single cloud hostingprovider to run the majority of an organizations workloads. Table 1 shows thepercentage of respondents to the 2021, 2022, and 2023 surveys who reported usingAWS, Azure, or GCP to run 75% or more of their applications. Figure 3 details thecomplete distribution of the 2023 survey responses.Table 1\.

Extent of Cloud\-Based Application HostingSANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey5There are many reasons, including the need for business continuity planning andthe desire for negotiation leverage, that an organization may choose to distribute itsworkloads across multiple cloud service providers. The benefits of using multiple cloudservice providers are obvious, but so are their security implications: Each providersenvironment must be properly secured, but every environment works differently andpresents different security challenges. And the work involved increases exponentially witheach additional provider used.One way leading DevSecOps teams are coping with the multicloud challenge is by creatingplatform\-agnostic applications, typically using containerization, so that the applicationcan run in any cloud service providers container service, or even on\-premises, with thenecessary infrastructure in place.Securing Multicloud EnvironmentsThe increasing reliance on multiple cloud service providers, with a mix of VMs, containers,and FaaS, also sharply increases the challenges of ensuring that all those cloud resourcesare properly secured. To evaluate this challenge, the 2023 DevSecOps survey consideredsimilar results from identical questions asked in the 2022 and 2023 surveys regarding twoof the most important sets of cloud security tools:To what extent has your organization adopted cloud security posture management(CSPM) software, either commercial or open source? (See Figure 4 for years20222023\.)To what extent has your organization adopted cloud workload protection platform(CWPP) software? (See Figure 5 for years 20222023\.)The survey results from these two years show that even though CSPM is widely deployed,it is still highly underutilized. Most respondents said they are using either a commercial oran open source CSPM tool, but fewer than 16% overall (2023\) and 21% overall (2022\) saidthey use those solutions for 75% or more of their AWS accounts, Azure subscriptions, orGCP projects.SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey6To what extent has your organization adopted

One cause might be thatthe increase in the use of these tools has made organizations more aware of their cloudprovider inventories and the weaknesses in their protections. Another cause might bethat vendor pricing is driving organizations to make difficult choices between inadequateprotection and unacceptable cost.CWPP products are also very much underutilized. Although a majority of the respondents(greater than 70% across all platforms) said their organizations use CWPP, a much smallerpercentage (less than 15% overall in 2023, down slightly from 17% in 2022\) use it in at least75% or more of their AWS accounts, Azure subscriptions, or GCP projects.Both findings suggest that DevSecOps teams are missing avaluable opportunity to enhance the security of their cloudenvironments. CSPM software can help DevSecOps teams ensurethat the cloud environments that host their applications areproperly configured and secured using industry best practices,but only if this software is used consistently across all cloudaccounts. Similarly, CWPPs provide various security servicesfor workloads, regardless of whether the work is performedby VMs, containers, or serverless computing. In the past, thiswould typically have required the installation of multiple agents,resulting in a drain on VM resources, but CWPP solutions haveevolved to overcome that problem.TAKEAWAYBoth CSPM and CWPP are essential capabilities for 
organizations operating in multicloud environments. As an 
organization moves further away from reliance on a single 
cloud hosting provider, the work of securing each cloud 
environment increases exponentially. Organizations should 
consider using or increasing their adoption of commercial 
or open source CSPM software to ensure that each cloud 
environment is securely configured, and they should 
implement CWPPs to protect application workloads at 
execution time.SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey7Security at VelocityThe survey results clearly show that delivery velocitythe speed at which changes aremade to applications in developmentis remarkably stable. When asked how often theirorganizations deliver system changes to production, 54% of respondents said at least weekly,with 24% reporting that changes are delivered at least once per day or on a continuous basis.The distribution of delivery times has been fairly consistent for the past three years, with aslight dip this year in the daily and continuous categories (see Figure 6\).On average, how often do you deploy system changes to production applications?

to Production, 20212023Investments in continuous integrationcontinuous deployment (CICD) tooling enableorganizations to make small changes to their production codebase faster, with many teamsworking to deliver a constant stream of changes that can be pushed to production. The highratio of developers to security engineers makes it clear that the only way to keep pace isto automate security testing in the CICD pipeline so that every code push is evaluated forsecurity flaws.The fact that approximately 45% of respondents reported deploying changes on a weekly ordaily basis, but not continuously, suggests that DevSecOps teams may now have more timeavailable to run deeper scans, between code commit and release to production, while alsomeeting business delivery requirements.Organizational leaders should look for meaningful metrics that make it possible to ensurethat 100% of the application portfolio is deployed using CICD pipelines complete withsecurity tests. Once all applications have integrated security testing performed at everypass through the pipeline, new security tests can be introduced to raise the bar until allsecurity requirements are achieved. Its important to remember that security tests can onlybe designed to test for known issues. For this reason, penetration tests and bug bountieswhich can help security practitioners find unknown issuesstill have an essential role toplay in a comprehensive application security program. Cloud\-native application protectionplatforms are being used to characterize normal application behavior and enforce zero\-trustprinciples as an additional countermeasure to protect against exploited security flaws (seethe DevSecOps Tools and Practices: What Works? section for more details).SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey8On average, how often do you assess or test the security of your business\-critical applications?

Business\-Critical Applications, 
20212023New security threats, flaws, and vulnerabilities are, of course, being discoveredconstantly. Even an application with a stable codebase can have security flaws thatremain undiscovered until the application is subjected to security testing. When mostorganizations (54%) are delivering application changes to production at least weekly, theonly way to cope with this volume of activity is to automate security testing and integrateit with the CICD tool chain.The implementation of automated security testing requires significant investment. Butonce this investment has been made, organizations can utilize these capabilities toincrementally improve the security of the applications they build, write custom teststo assess all their applications, and quickly assess the impact of newly discoveredvulnerabilities across their application portfolio.To explore this trend, we asked, On average, how often do you assess or test the securityof your business\-critical applications? (See Figure 7 above.) The responses were striking:53% of respondents said their organizations test the security of their business\-critical applications at least weekly, with 31% testing them at least daily.Comparing the share of organizations that are deployingapplications weekly or more frequently (54%) with that oforganizations testing their business\-critical applicationsat least weekly (53%) indicates that integrated automatedsecurity testing with DevOps tooling is becoming the norm.TAKEAWAYSecurity organizations should automate as much of the 
security testing process as possible, so that testing can 
be performed more frequently, more broadly, and more 
cost\-effectively.Security at velocity also involves remediation speed, of course.Automated security testing is highly effective at identifying known security vulnerabilities,but remediating critical security issues takes engineering time and managementcommitment. The 2023 distribution of responses looks much like the responses from 2022,with 53% and 54% of respondents, respectively, stating that their organizations get criticalsecurity issues resolved within a week or less.SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey9On average, how long does it take for your organization to patchresolve critical security risksvulnerabilities for systems in use? 2023 202230\.7%27\.3%25\.5%20\.9%16\.5%10\.8%11\.1%9\.7%7\.6%5\.6%10\.8%10\.8%3\.2%2\.6%2\.0%1\.8%UnknownSame dayNext day27 days830 days13 months46 months612 months0\.3%0\.7%More than

Vulnerabilities, 20222023The tail of the distribution, however, shows that 16% of the respondents are aware thatit takes their organization more than 30 days to fix critical security issues. Developmentteams often feel pressure from management to prioritize new functionality over themaintenance of application security. And whereas creating new functionality is interesting,most people consider patching security issues to be drudgery. To help developmentteams address issues in components included in their applications, numerous SCA tools(for example, Mend SCA, Snyk Open Source, Synopsys Black Duck,1 and Veracode SCA)include the ability to integrate with source code management systems to create a pullrequest that developers can review, test, and merge into the feature code as part of theirworkflows, reducing some of the burden on them and also reducing the time to repair thevulnerability (see Figure 8\).Automated CompliancePolicy\-as\-code and CSPM are different techniques for enforcing compliance policiesautomatically. In this years surveylike the previous yearsmore than 60% ofWhat percentage of compliance policies are checkedenforced automatically? 
20212023respondents (62% in 2023, 60% in2022\) said that at least 50% of theirorganizations compliance enforcementis automated. Still, the number ofrespondents who reported that 100% oftheir policies are enforced automaticallydecreased significantly in 2023 from2022 (6% versus 18%). There was also adecrease in the percentage of respondentswho either hadnt implemented any automated policy enforcement or didnt know howmuch coverage their automated policy checks had. (These responses show as negativepercentages in Figure 9\.)Figure 9\. Percentage of 
Compliance Policies Checked or 
Enforced AutomaticallySANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey10The use of automated checking or enforcement of compliance policies shows that DevSecOpsprinciples are starting to have a more significant impact on security practices. Security teamshave begun to recognize the importance of implementing DevOps principles within theirown practices to achieve enterprise scale and development agility. At the same time, DevOpsteams are integrating policy\-as\-code tests into their CICD pipelines to validate securitypolicy compliance. These tests have value that extendsbeyond compliance, because theyre cost\-effective: Writinga security test has a one\-time cost that quickly approacheszero per test when that test is performed frequently. Bothpractices are helping organizations meet the goal of scalablecontinuous compliance.Securing Container ServicesWeve already seen that as organizations move to thecloud, they deploy their applications using a combinationof VMs, FaaS, and containerized workloads. Whereas VMsoffer a strongly self\-supported model that corresponds toon\-premises data center environments, and FaaS offers amostly cloud\-provider\-supported model, the containerizedworkloads space includes a wide range of support modelsbetween the other two, so its worthwhile to take a closerlook at how container services are being used.Organizations looking to use container orchestration toolsface three basic questions. The first question is whether touse Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or some other orchestrationoption. The second question is whether to use such a tool asa managed service or to manage it themselves, and the thirdquestion is whether to run on cloud\-hosted or on\-premisesinfrastructure. Figure 10 shows the choices of containerorchestration tools that respondents organizations havemade over the past three years of the survey:Cloud hosted is more prevalent than cloud managedfor both container services and Kubernetes.Figure 10\. Container Orchestration Tools 
Used to Manage Production WorkloadsFor on\-premises organizations, the choicebetween an orchestrator (Kubernetes orOpenShift) and a container engine (Dockeror Docker Swarm) is an even split for 2023\.Cloud\-managed container services hadan approximately 10% increase this year,suggesting that as organizations migrate tothe cloud and to containers, theyre favoringcloud\-managed container services overcloud\-managed Kubernetes services.TAKEAWAYWhen moving containerized workloads to the cloud, many organizations 
seem to be taking a lift\-and\-shift approach, moving their on\-premises 
VMs, which host Kubernetes or Docker environments, to cloud\-hosted 
VMs that perform the same functions. As the provider\-managed offerings 
for Docker and Kubernetes mature, this lift\-and\-shift approach may 
create challenges for organizations trying to achieve deeper integration 
with their cloud providers security tools. That lift\-and\-shift approach 
may, however, also reflect an intentional choice by organizations to avoid 
these deep integrations as part of their multicloud strategy.SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey11Programming Environments and RisksWhich languages and platforms in your application 
portfolio have been the greatest source of risk or 
exposure to your organization? Select your top three.Surprisingly, the top 4 responses to the question of which languagesand platforms present the greatest risk to their application portfoliosshow no overlap at all with 2022s answers.

The emphasis on security testing prior to codingarchitecturedesign and requirementsuse casesthat wasseen in 2022 has declined sharply this year, and testingwhile coding via integrated development environment(IDE) plug\-ins has declined, as well. The shift security leftmentality seems to be less pervasive among this yearsrespondents, which could be attributed to the shift in theindustries and roles represented (see Figure 14\).The changes from last year to this in both top roles andtop industries represented suggest that organizationsin highly regulated industries (notably banking andfinance) prioritize security testing to meet their regulatoryrequirements. Additionally, in nearly every category, fewerrespondents indicated that they perform security testing ineach phase of the build and release pipeline workflow.When asked about the tools, practices, or techniques theirorganizations use, the 2023 survey respondents identifiedupfront risk assessments before development starts asthe most useful item. Given the high value of upfront riskassessments, it seems unfortunate that 9% fewer surveyparticipants than last year are performing security testingduring those risk assessments as part of their workflows.Architecturedesign

Nonetheless, over 95% ofrespondents reported using manual code review, despite their evident distaste for it.This polarization surrounding the usefulness of manual code review becomes especiallyconcerning when coupled with pull requestcode commit being the most popular timeto perform security testing, because if manual code review is not valued, the likelihoodof sloppy or rushed reviews resulting in security flaws increases (see Figure 15\).What application security tools, practices, or techniques do you use in your organization?

Table 2 shows the perception of usefulness for theapplication security tools, practices, and techniques rated by survey respondents, with the mostuseful listed first. The Change column shows changes to the ranking order from 2022 to 2023\. Somenoteworthy changes include:Third\-party compliance reviews or audits moved up 10 places, despite the large decline indemographics of survey respondents from banking and finance industries.Threat modeling, attack surface analysis, or architecturedesign and upfront riskassessments before development starts both moved up eight positions, with the latter seenas most useful overall this year. Upward movement in these two categories epitomizes shiftingsecurity left, toward work that can be done before a single line of code is even written.SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey16The 2023 respondents viewed aweb application firewall (WAF)and internal penetration testingoptions as much less usefulthan 2022s cohort (drops of 12and 11 positions, respectively).This reinforces the perceptionamong those surveyed that earlyintervention is critical to success.How do you assess or test the security of your business\-critical applications?

by Role, 20212023Where internal testing is concerned, there is still a heavy reliance on internal security teams.The survey responses indicate that organizations typically have two or more internal teamsdoing some manner of security testing and that nearly all have some external source for securityfindings (see Figure 18\).In the automated testing coverage chart (Figure 19\), the responses from 2022 and 2023 areshown interleaved by year, with unknown and 0% coverage response percentages presented asnegatives.

Code Base Subject to Automated MethodsSANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey18This year we also see static application security testing (SAST) usage reported by over 85%of respondents, with 79% of respondents using SAST to cover at least 25% of their code.There was also a notable increase in software compositionanalysis (SCA) testing this year. Regardless of whether theSCA increase is related to the increase in SAST coverage, theincreased adoption of cloud\-hosted CICD platforms (whichoften include some form of SCA capability), or a blend of both,organizations are clearly taking supply chain security seriously.In light of the increased adoption of container\-based cloudenvironments, the increased usage and coverage of containerimage scanning is also a positive sign.TAKEAWAYBefore testing how an application behaves when running, 
its crucial that organizations assess their supply chains, 
especially for containerized workloads. Scanning container 
images, analyzing the collection of third\-party components 
used to build an application (SCA), and analyzing custom code 
with SAST tools all contribute to clearly understanding which 
risks are present in an application before it ever executes.DevSecOps Tools and Practices: What Works?Build automation, continuous integration, and automated testing remain the leadingorganizational practices, as they have been for the past two years. These are corepractices for both DevOps and DevSecOps, so they will continue to be important areas fororganizational investment.Another continuing trend from prior years is that immutable infrastructure, blamelessretrospectives, and chaos engineering remain underutilized practices (see Table 3\).Table 3\.

KPIs can provide organizations the informationneeded to ensure stable DevSecOps processes, andthey can provide insights into the impact of processand tool changes made within those processes.The number of open security vulnerabilities remainsthe KPI that is most widely used to measure thesuccess of DevSecOps programs, just as it was for thepreceding two years. Time to fix security vulnerabilitieswas the second most important KPI in 2021 and 2022,but that KPI was displaced this year by false positiverates. This suggests that as programs mature andthe volume of security test results increases, surveyparticipants find that ensuring a finding is a truepositive is more important than quickly addressingfindings that may have little to no impact in theirenvironments. The increase in the importance of falsepositive rates makes intuitive sense, when consideredin conjunction with the overall increase in testingactivity and coverage we previously mentioned (seeFigure 19\). Tracking coverage of automated tests roundsout the top 3 this year, just as it did last year (seeFigure 20\).That these are the top 3 KPIs suggests that successfulDevSecOps programs are using automated testing withwide coverage not only to verify changes to code butalso to confirm that any reported vulnerabilities aretrue positives and to leverage the synergy betweenthese capabilities to drive down the number of opensecurity vulnerabilities.What are the major KPIs you use to measure the success of your

20212023SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey20Top DevSecOps Challenges and Success FactorsThe survey respondents view of the No. 1 success factor in building a DevSecOps programhas changed over the years, from training to buy\-in to integrated security testing. Thisshift in the No. 1 success factor indicates that in just three short years organizations havemade significant advances in learning to develop and implement DevSecOps programs.It also tells us that tooling is available to be integrated into DevSecOps practices.Communication, by contrast, has held second place continuously for the last three yearsSANS has conducted this survey.Reinforcing the availability of tooling for DevSecOps teams and practitioners, this yearsNo. 1 challenge to implementing a solid program is the lack of sufficient budget for thosetools, and for security programs overall. This has consistently placed as a top 5 challengeduring the past three years.The efforts to build successful DevSecOps programslike any shift in organizationalculture and practices implemented over multiple yearshave been hampered by changingrequirements and organizational silos. The mirrored stability of communication as asuccess factor (No. 2 for the past three years) and organizational silos as a challenge (No.1 in 2021, No. 3 in 2022 and 2023\) makes it clear that breaking down internal organizationalbarriers to enable communication remains fundamental to building a successfulDevSecOps practice.During the past three years, integrating automated securityTAKEAWAYtesting into workflows has risen from fifth to first as a successfactor for organizations. Nobody who is familiar with theCALMS6 model for DevOpsthe C in CALMS stands for culture,the A for automationwill be surprised to see communicationleading the way as an indicator of success in DevSecOpspractices (see Table 4, on the next page).A successful DevSecOps program requires a strong focus on 
communication and culture to break down organizational 
silos. As the DevSecOps journey progresses, agreeing on the 
why (getting buy\-in), understanding the what (training), and 
implementing the how (integrating tools into processes) 
may be temporary top priorities, but communication must 
not be neglected.6CALMS Framework, www.atlassian.comdevopsframeworkscalms\-frameworkSANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey21Table 4\. Respondents Ranking of DevSecOps Success Factors and Challenges, 20212023Success FactorIntegrating automated security testing into

The intenserecent publicity about AI and the increasing availability of AI models, training data,and tools make this an area where ongoing adoption seems highly likely. That said,a strong contingent of the respondents (approximately 30%) reported not using AIor data science capabilities at all. This may reflect issues such as the rising level ofconcern surrounding data privacy and ownership of intellectual property. Responsesalso captured an increase in pilot projects integrating security operations into boththe AI and machine learning ops and data science operations categoriesapossible indication that organizations are performing threat modeling and riskassessments prior to incorporating AI capabilities into products (see Table 5\).Table 5\.

These three practicesare often interrelated and interwoven, so it makes sense that they move as a group,reinforcing one another.The subject of platform engineering to streamline the flow from idea toimplementation was added to the survey this year. The responses show greaterawareness and adoption of platform engineering practices than of application securityorchestration and correlation (ASOC) tools. As the developer self\-service featuresinherent in a platform engineering practice mature, it will be essential to leverage theorchestration used to build, package, test, and deploy an application to incorporatesecurity testing and tooling at key points along the path that has been laid out. Awell\-implemented software engineering platform, designed in close collaboration withsecurity stakeholders, could likely meet an organizations ASOC objectives.SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey23This years respondents replied to the overall set of Future Trends questions with anunknown response roughly half as often as last year. It seems possible that this indicatesthat DevSecOps efforts are being communicated better within organizations, indicatingthat the sharing principle from the CALMS framework (the S in CALMS) is taking hold.From 2022 to 2023, all positive responses increased, with the exception of developingwith microservices, which saw a small decrease (see Figure 21\).Emerging Technology for DevSecOps 20222023 Unknown Not at allConducting preliminary investigation Experimenting or conducting pilot projectsPartially integratedFully integratedApplying articial intelligence or data

Emerging Technology for 
DevSecOps, 20222023SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey24Going ForwardA DevSecOps program needs to integrate the practices of security, development, andoperations teams, creating a cohesive, collaborative system development life cycle. Thisrequires substantial initial and ongoing investment by the organization, but its benefitswhich include reduced time to fix security issues, less burdensome security processes, andincreased ownership of application security7are well understood.This years survey continues to point toward increasing maturity and adoption of DevSecOpspractices, but the survey data also reveal areas for improvement. Key takeaways from the 2023survey include:Although workloads are migrating to the cloud, DevSecOps teams may be missing out onsome of the advantages of immutable containers and ephemeral serverless functions.Both approaches fit well with CICD deployments and can be utilized to createapplications that are secure, performant, and potentially more cost\-effective than VMs.Multicloud has become the norm. When organizations use multiple cloud providers,the work to secure those clouds grows exponentially. DevSecOps practitioners shouldconsider implementing and expanding the use of open source or commercial CSPMtools to assess and manage infrastructure security at scale. Additionally, using CWPPscan enable organizations to protect resources across cloud providers.DevSecOps teams should continue to invest in tools that help to ensure the securityand integrity of their applications and all the dependent components in their softwaresupply chains.Organizations should leverage KPIs to identify the most important area for theorganization to improve next. Benchmarking against peer organizations metrics can beused to expand management support, and they also help to demonstrate due care.DevSecOps teams should limit the programming languages approved for newdevelopment projects based on security risks and availability of security testing tools(among other factors), and they should refactor older code written with memory\-unsafelanguages as opportunities arise.When moving workloads to the cloud, organizations must choose between a lift\-and\-shift approach that minimizes the use of cloud\-provider\-specific capabilities and arebuild\-and\-integrate approach that makes intentional use of each cloud providersunique capabilities. There is no one\-size\-fits\-all approach, so organizations shoulddevelop guidance to apply consistently to their decision\-making process.Organizations should continue to champion a culture of communication and sharedresponsibility for security across teams, processes, and projects.As machine learning and AI efforts erupt across organizations, they should continue toapply the shift security left mentality by performing risk assessments and creatingthreat models for AI experiments and projects before starting work.7DevOps Digest, A Primer on Secure DevOps: Learn the Benefits of These 3 DevSecOps Use Cases, July 18, 2022,www.devopsdigest.comsecure\-devops\-use\-casesSANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey25Organizations continue to be pressured to do more work with fewer resourcesespeciallypersonnel. DevSecOps is an approach that can help relieve some of that pressure. Theright KPIs will keep teams focused on the proper priorities, and investments in automationfor build, test, and deployment work will increase agility, including agility in responding tosecurity incidents.Critical focus areas for a successful DevSecOps program are:Early consideration for the security facets of any project, through risk assessmentand threat modeling prior to writing any codeAutomation of security tests aligned with well\-defined standards and practicesComprehensive understanding of the security status of resources required torun your applications, including infrastructure, third\-party software and softwaredeveloped in\-houseAutomation of the entire build, test, and deploy process, to accelerate responding toattacks and vulnerabilities and to enable automatic remediationMany organizations feel an urgent need for more qualified DevSecOps personnel. Becausedemand continues to outweigh supply in this area, there is a real need to spark moreinterest in this ever\-changing field. To cope with the scarcity of talent amid competitivepressures, organizations should further leverage proven DevSecOps practices and exploreemerging technological capabilities. This may mean harnessing some of the underutilizedtechnology (for example, CSPM, CWPP, AI, machine learning ASOC) or applying newtools, technologies, and practices (for example, immutable infrastructure, zero trust,benchmarking) in pursuit of optimizing and streamlining DevSecOps.This survey showcases the progress made by the DevSecOps community in improvingorganizations security postures and organizational effectiveness, recognizes thechallenges it still faces, and highlights areas for additional focus on the path toDevSecOps excellence.SponsorSANS would like to thank this surveys sponsor:SANS 2023 DevSecOps Survey26
