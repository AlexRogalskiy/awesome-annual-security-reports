Flexera Secunia Research Team who produces valuable advisories leveraged by users of Flexeras 
Soeware Vulnerability Research and Soeware Vulnerability Manager solu8ons.The report analyzes the evolu8on of soeware security from a vulnerability, threat intelligence and 
patch perspec8ve.The report presents global data on the prevalence of vulnerabili8es, exploits, the availability of 
patches and maps the security threats to IT infrastructures.What does the report cover?The annual Vulnerability Review is based on data from Flexera's Secunia Research. Secunia Research 
monitors more than 69,000 applica8ons, appliances and opera8ng systems, and tests and veries the 
vulnerabili8es reported in them.The systems and applica8ons monitored by Secunia Research are in use in the environments of the 
customers of Flexera Soeware Vulnerability Management solu8ons.The vulnerability database covers vulnerabili8es that can be exploited in all types of products, 
including soeware, hardware and rmware.The vulnerabili8es veried by Secunia Research are described in Secunia Advisories and listed in the 
Flexera Vulnerability Database, detailing what IT security teams need to know to mi8gate the 
vulnerability risk posed in their environments. The Secunia Advisory descrip8ons include cri8cality, 
a;ack vector, exploitability and solu8on status.How do we count vulnerabili6es?Research houses in the vulnerability management space adopt dierent approaches to coun8ng 
vulnerabili8es.Secunia Research counts vulnerabili8es per product in which the vulnerability appears. We apply this 
method to reect the level of informa8on our customers need to keep their environments secure.We provide veried intelligence lis8ng all products aected by a given vulnerability.Secunia Research So9ware Vulnerability tracking process
A vulnerability is an error in soeware which can be exploited with a security impact and gain. Secunia 
Research validates, veries and tests vulnerability informa8on to author security advisories which 
provide valuable details by following consistent and standard processes that have been rened over 
the years.2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al5Whenever a new vulnerability is reported, its veried and a Secunia Advisory is published. A Secunia 
Advisory provides details, including descrip8on of the vulnerability, risk ra8ng, impact, a;ack vector, 
recommended mi8ga8on, credits, references and more, including addi8onal details discovered 
during verica8on and tes8ng, thus providing the informa8on required to make appropriate 
decisions about how to protect systems.Click here to learn more about Secunia Advisories and their contents.2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al6Example why its not a good idea to rely on NVD only

advisory links), so, e.g in this example there was no informaSon added to the MITRE Tomcat CVE 
entry and thus NVD doesn't have anything to show beyond the basics. NVD is frequently not complete 
when it comes to libraries components that are used in a lot of "downstreams". (downstreams: Vendors 
using libraries components for other so9ware products.Best recent example is the cascading downstream 
eect of the Log4J and Log4shell vulnerabiliDes)2\.Secunia Research on the other hand, don't have to rely on the MITRE informaSon, so Secunia Research 
frequently reacts earlier, many Smes even before a CVE was assigned (if one gets assigned at all).

This was for sure a busy year for cybersecurity, not only a record\-breaking number of advisories and 
Vulnerabili8es were reported, but also many signicant vulnerabili8es were the cause of data 
breaches, ransomware a;acks and other types of threats that impacted many organiza8ons 
worldwide.Interesng facts and trends:2023 is the year with the most recorded Secunia Advisories since 2002NVD published 28,834 CVEs in 2023, an increase of 15% compared to 2022 (25,050 CVEs)Average threat score went up: 15\.68 (2022: 13\.66\) (click here to learn how we calculate this)Average CVSS3 score just slightly lower: 7\.28 (2022: 7\.35\)More extreme crical advisories have been reported in 2023: 74 (2022: 44\)130 advisories reported a zero\-day vulnerability (2022: 85\)More than 50 percent of all advisories are UnixLinux opera8ng systems vulnerabili8es.More than 50 percent of all rejected advisories are also UnixLinux opera8ng systems related. Li;le over 72 percent of all networking\-related advisories are for Cisco, F5 and JuniperAbout Microsoe:2\.56% of all advisories were for Microso^, which put them (again) in eighth place in vendorranking.57\.6% (2022: 56 percent) of all zero\-days were related to Microso^ products (rst place).None of the top four vendors with the most advisories (SUSE, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Ubuntu) had anyzero\-day reported in 2023Soeware Vulnerability and Patch Management are becoming increasingly important. Due to the 
ongoing Russia\-Ukraine conict, a;acks on cri8cal infrastructures in many countries are increasing. 
Back in 2019 (just before COVID\-19\), patching was recommended within 30 days (or 14 days for CVSS 
score of seven or higher). Right now, hackers can deploy exploits within one week and even within 
24 hours. This means organiza8ons need even be;er priori8za8on to quickly patch vulnerabili8es 
(especially those with associated threats).2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al8Advisories breakdown

consequence when a vulnerability has been exploited. There are twelve values that canbe 
used (most advisories have one or more). Read more here.2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al11Advisories and Impact (Consequence of exploited)Priori8zing vulnerabili8es based on the 
poten8al consequence is a crucial aspect 
of eec8ve cybersecurity management.
The use of a scoring mechanism allows 
organiza8ons to systema8cally assess and 
priori8ze vulnerabili8es, ensuring that the 
most cri8cal issues are addressed rst.below an example of a scoring table 
that can be used in a priori8za8on 
process.Impact (Consequence)
The following are Consequence values.Brute Force
Used in cases where an applica4on or an algorithm allows an 
aCacker to guess passwords in an easy manner.Cross\-Site Scrip7ngCross\-Site Scrip4ng vulnerabili4es allow a third party to 
manipulate the content or behavior of a web applica4on in a 
user's browser, without compromising the underlying system. 
Dierent Cross\-Site Scrip4ng related vulnerabili4es are also 
classied under this category, including script inser4on and 
cross\-site request forgery.
Cross\-Site Scrip4ng vulnerabili4es are oNen used against specic 
users of a website to steal their creden4als or to conduct spoong 
aCacks.DoS (Denial of Service)This includes vulnerabili4es ranging from excessive resource 
consump4on (for example, causing a system to use a lot of 
memory) to crashing an applica4on or an en4re system.Exposure of Sensi7ve Informa7on
Vulnerabili4es where documents or creden4als are leaked or can 
be revealed either locally or remotely.Exposure of System Informa7onVulnerabili4es where excessive informa4on about the system (for 
example. version numbers, running services, installa4on paths,2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al12and similar) are exposed and can be revealed from remote 
and, in some cases, locally.client or server system can gain access to the administrator or root 
account, thus taking full control of the system.HijackingCovers vulnerabili4es where a user session or a 
communica4on channel can be taken over by other users or 
remote aCackers.Manipula7on of DataThis includes vulnerabili4es where a user or a remote 
aCacker can manipulate local data on a system, but not 
necessarily be able to gain escalated privileges or system 
access. The most frequent type of vulnerabili4es with this 
impact are SQL\-injec4on vulnerabili4es, where a malicious 
user or person can manipulate SQL queries.Privilege Escala7onCovers vulnerabili4es where a user is able to conduct certain 
tasks with the privileges of other users or administra4ve 
users. This typically includes cases where a local user on aSecurity BypassCovers vulnerabili4es or security issues where malicious users or 
people can bypass certain security mechanisms of the applica4on. 
The actual impact varies signicantly depending on the design andpurpose of the aected applica4on.Spoong
Covers various vulnerabili4es where it is possible for malicious 
users or people to impersonate other users or systems.System AccessCovers vulnerabili4es where malicious people are able to gain 
system access and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a 
local user.UnknownRejec2on advisories.
There are large number of vulnerabili8es posted in the Na8onal Vulnerability Database (NVD), by many 
vendors and CNAs. They are not always valid, they are not always assigned proper cri8cality ra8ngs, 
and in some cases, a vulnerability may be legi8mate but does not provide the a;acker any benet.The Flexera Secunia Research team evaluates vulnerabili8es from hundreds of sources, rescores them 
when necessary and even rejects vulnerabili8es not worth your a;en8on. Rejecon advisories help 
you reduce the volume of vulnerabili8es to be mi8gated by helping you focus only on those that 
present reasonable risk to your environment.For compliance reasons, for example NERC (North American Electric Reliability Corpora8on), you may 
be required to report not only the vulnerabili8es covered by the normal Advisories but also 
vulnerabili8es, which our Research Team has rejected as not being a valid threat to security.On average 15% of the total number of advisories are rejec8on 
advisories.2023 result was 15\.95% (1,500 rejec8on advisories)Overview rejec6on advisories2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al13An advisory may be rejected for many reasons; the most common are:No reachabilityThe vulnerability cannot be exploited because the aected systems cannot be reached by 
an a;acker.No gainThe vulnerability may be reached, but without any gain for the a;acker.No exploitabilityThe vulnerability cannot be exploited because, for example, policy forbids installa8on of 
the aected soeware.Dependent on otherThe vulnerability cannot be exploited by itself but depends on another vulnerability being 
present.2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al14Addressing awareness with vulnerability insightsPrevalence:How many systems would benet from any given security update?Does it pose a risk? Is it on all systems? Patch2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al15Asset sensi2vity:

Focusing on advisories with CVSS 7 or higher would address about 50 percent of exploits. Most exploits are CVSS 
scored between four and seven. Focusing on vulnerabiliSes for the top 20 vendors would address only about 20 
percent.Take away 1:

Web browsers serve as our gateway to the internet, providing a seamless interface for accessing 
informa8on, services, and entertainment. However, this very connec8vity exposes browsers to an array 
of vulnerabili8es, in most cases exploited through a remote aeack vector.The urgency of 8mely browser patching cannot be overstated. As users traverse the digital landscape, 
the constant evolu8on of security mechanisms by browser developers remains a cri8cal line of 
defense. Failing to patch vulnerabili8es in a 8mely manner increases the likelihood of falling vic8m to 
remote exploits, exposing users to a range of poten8al risks.Advisories per browserltered on avg. threat score. note:Zero\-day vulnerabili2esBrowser A5ack Vector2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al21Networking\-related advisoriesNumber of advisories per networking\-related vendorAverage threat and CVSS score per networking\-related vendor.2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al22Threat intelligence

NVD largely relies on the vendors or third par8es (CNAs) upda8ng the CVE entries on MITRE (like more 
vendor advisory links). CVEs are reported for a component or library ini8ally but could aect tens or 
hundreds of products downstream, but that kind of detailed informa8on is not always available in a 
8mely manner.Relying on NVD data is therefore not advised since not all products and version branches are covered. 
Other challenges with NVD are invalid or superseded vulnerabili8es (with superseded xes).

Most of 2023s vulnerabili8es were vendor patched. In fact, most vulnerabili8es are patched within 24 
hours aeer disclosure.2024 Flexera\|Company Conden4al24The challenge remains that organiza8ons dont have full visibility or awareness when a vulnerability is 
disclosed (8me to awareness). Another big challenge is 8me to remedia8on (the 8me from having 
this informa8on, correla8ng that with your environment and ini8a8ng the process to get the soeware
