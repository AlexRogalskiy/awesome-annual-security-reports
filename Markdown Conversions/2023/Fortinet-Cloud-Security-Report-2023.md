In 2023, the cloud is fundamentally delivering on its promised business outcomes, including flexible 
capacity and scalability, increased agility, improved availability, and accelerated deployment and 
provisioning.
However, security concerns remain a critical barrier to cloud adoption, showing little signs of 
improvement in the perception of cloud security professionals. Cloud adoption is further inhibited by 
a number of related challenges that prevent the faster and broader embracement of cloud services, 
including the continued lack of cloud security talent, proliferating compliance requirements, and the 
significant lack of visibility and control, especially in hybrid and multi\-cloud environments.
This 2023 Cloud Security Report surveyed 752 cybersecurity professionals to reveal key challenges 
and priorities, including:
Cloud security continues to be a significant issue, with 95% of surveyed organizations 
concerned about their security posture in public cloud environments. Misconfiguration 
remains the biggest cloud security risk, according to 59% of cybersecurity professionals. 
This is closely followed by exfiltration of sensitive data and insecure interfacesAPIs 
(tied at 51%), and unauthorized access (49%).
Despite economic headwinds, cloud security budgets are increasing for the majority of
organizations (60%) by an average of 33%.
44% of organizations are looking for ways to achieve better visibility and control in securing 
hybrid and multi\-cloud networks, with 90% looking for a single cloud security platform to protect 
data consistently and comprehensively across their cloud footprint.
We would like to thank Fortinet for supporting this important industry research project. We hope 
youll find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts to secure your 
organizations cloud journey against evolving threats.
Thank you,
Holger Schulze

Despite a leveling out of cloud adoption year\-over\-year, the pace of moving workloads to the cloud 
remains strong. Today, 39% of respondents have more than half of their workloads in the cloud, while 
58% plan to reach this level in the next 1218 months.

As workloads move to the cloud, organizations are selecting the cloud platform thats the best fit for each 
project. This is driving multi\-cloud proliferation with nearly seven out of 10 companies in our survey using 
two or more cloud providers (69%).

While the cloud offers important advantages, significant barriers to cloud adoption still exist. The biggest 
challenges organizations are facing are not primarily about technology, but people and processes. Most 
critical is the perennial lack of qualified staff (37%), which continues to be the largest impediment to 
faster adoption, despite dropping slightly from last year. This is closely followed by legal and regulatory 
compliance (30%), data security issues (29%), and integration with existing IT environments (27%).

After years of cloud adoption, do organizations believe cloud computing is delivering on its promise? The 
answer is yes. Cloud users affirm that the cloud is delivering key business benefits, including flexibility 
and scale (53%), agility (45%), business continuity (44%), and accelerated deployment and provisioning 
(41%). This is the first year that accelerated deployment has made it into the top four, leapfrogging both 
performance and the move to variable OpEx.

are smart about integrating cybersecurity into their move to the cloud are also seeing its value to the 
business in lower risk and improved security (42%) and in cost reductions (41%).

Despite increasing cloud adoption, cloud security concerns show no signs of improving. Virtually all 
surveyed organizations are moderately to extremely concerned about their security posture in public 
cloud environments (95%). The number of organizations that are extremely concerned about public 
cloud security even increased this year 35%, up from 32%.

Concerns about public cloud security, combined with a lack of resources and expertise, are driving 
the perception that the risk of a security breach in the public cloud is higher than in traditional on\-
premises environments (43%). Only 27% of security professionals perceive risk to be lower in a public 
cloud environment.

Cybersecurity professionals face numerous challenges when it comes to protecting cloud workloads. 
The people factor again sits at the top of the list, lack of qualified security staff (43%), closely followed 
by compliance (37%). Multi\-cloud proliferation is almost certainly the reason behind the headache of 
delivering consistent security policies (32%).

The 2023 Cloud Security Report is based on a comprehensive global survey of 752 cybersecurity 
professionals conducted in February 2023, to uncover how cloud user organizations are adopting the 
cloud, how they see cloud security evolving, and what best practices IT cybersecurity leaders are 
prioritizing in their move to the cloud. The respondents range from technical executives to IT security 
practitioners, representing a balanced cross\-section of organizations of varying sizes across multiple 
industries.
