Cloud Security
ReportINTRODUCTIONIn 2023, the cloud is fundamentally delivering on its promised business outcomes, including flexible 
capacity and scalability, increased agility, improved availability, and accelerated deployment and 
provisioning.However, security concerns remain a critical barrier to cloud adoption, showing little signs of 
improvement in the perception of cloud security professionals. Cloud adoption is further inhibited by 
a number of related challenges that prevent the faster and broader embracement of cloud services, 
including the continued lack of cloud security talent, proliferating compliance requirements, and the 
significant lack of visibility and control, especially in hybrid and multi\-cloud environments.This 2023 Cloud Security Report surveyed 752 cybersecurity professionals to reveal key challenges 
and priorities, including:Cloud security continues to be a significant issue, with 95% of surveyed organizations 
concerned about their security posture in public cloud environments. Misconfiguration 
remains the biggest cloud security risk, according to 59% of cybersecurity professionals. 
This is closely followed by exfiltration of sensitive data and insecure interfacesAPIs 
(tied at 51%), and unauthorized access (49%).Despite economic headwinds, cloud security budgets are increasing for the majority of
organizations (60%) by an average of 33%.44% of organizations are looking for ways to achieve better visibility and control in securinghybrid and multi\-cloud networks, with 90% looking for a single cloud security platform to protect 
data consistently and comprehensively across their cloud footprint.We would like to thank Fortinet for supporting this important industry research project. We hope 
youll find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts to secure your 
organizations cloud journey against evolving threats.Thank you,Holger SchulzeHolger Schulze
