future togetherIntroduction from Tom BurtOver the last year, threats to digital 
peace have reduced trust in technology 
and highlighted the urgent need for 
improved cyber defenses at all levels. 
Encouragingly, defenders the world over 
are responding to the call to improve 
security with the public and private 
sectors investing and collaborating 
to confront the challenges and build 
longterm resilience.In this fourth annual edition of the Microsoft Digital 
Defense Report, we draw on our unique vantage 
point to share insights on how the threat landscape 
has evolved and discuss the shared opportunities 
and challenges we all face in securing a resilient 
online ecosystem which the world can depend on.Close collaboration 
between the public 
and private sectors 
to formulate, enforce, 
and harmonize these 
requirements is crucial 
to improve global 
cybersecurity and 
foster innovation.4 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 1IntroductionAs the digital domain faces new and more 
threatening challenges, defenders are being driven 
to innovate and collaborate more closely than ever. 
For example, Russias use of cyberweapons as part 
of its hybrid war against Ukraine sparked sustained 
collaboration between Microsoft and Ukrainian 
officials to successfully defend against most of 
these cyberweapons.Russia is not alone in its use of destructive malware; 
we have also seen increased use of cyberweapons by 
Iran to pressure the Albanian government and in its 
ongoing conflict with Israel. At the same time, nation 
states are becoming increasingly sophisticated and 
aggressive in their cyber espionage efforts, led by 
highly capable Chinese actors focused on the Asia 
Pacific region in particular.One recent example of the troubling increase in 
aggression and capability involves a Chinese actor, 
which Microsoft calls Volt Typhoon. It used inventive 
tradecraft to infiltrate and preposition malware 
in the networks of a range of communications 
companies and other critical infrastructure 
organizations in Guam and the United States, 
deploying living off the land techniques to 
evade detection.Nationstate actors were not alone in stepping up 
their abuse of the digital ecosystem. Wellresourced 
cybercriminal syndicates also continue to grow 
and evolve, leveraging the cybercrime\-as\-a\-service 
ecosystem we highlighted last year. Ransomwareas 
a\-service and phishing\-as\-a\-service are key threats 
to businesses and cybercriminals have conducted 
business email compromise and other cybercrimes, 
largely undeterred by the increasing commitment 
of global law enforcement resources.Many vendors are taking steps to improve the 
cybersecurity of their products and services, 
developing new tools to help customers better 
defend against attackers. Governments across 
the globe are providing the public with more 
information about cyber threats and how to 
counter them, like the effective alerts from the US 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agencys 
(CISA) Shields Up campaign. Governments are also 
imposing new legal and regulatory requirements for 
cybersecurity. While many of these are beneficial, 
they can impose counterproductive conditions 
such as requiring overly rapid reporting of 
cybersecurity incidents or establishing inconsistent 
or conflicting requirements across agencies or 
geographies. Close collaboration between the 
public and private sectors to formulate, enforce, and 
harmonize these requirements is crucial to improve 
global cybersecurity and foster innovation.As we are seeing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
technologies are set to become a major focus 
of regulators and industry. We will undoubtedly 
see attackers using AI as a tool to refine phishing 
messages, develop malware and enable other 
abuses of technology. But AI will also be a critical 
component of successful defense. For example, 
in Ukraine we saw the first successful use of 
AI technology to help defend against Russian 
cyberattacks. In the coming years, innovation 
in AIpowered cyber defense will help reverse 
the tide of cyberattacks.Advancing the promise of digital peace requires 
publicprivate collaboration to ensure we are 
bringing to bear the best technological and 
regulatory tools to combat cyber aggression. 
We need more and deeper alliances in the 
private sector and stronger partnerships 
between the private and public sectors. 
Enabling this collaboration can be challenging 
but, when successful, it drives meaningful impact. 
We must accelerate the move of critical computing 
workloads to the cloud, where vendors security 
innovations will be most impactful, and ensure AI 
innovation provides defenders with the durable 
technological advantage over attackers that 
it promises.Tom Burt 
Corporate Vice President, Customer Security \& TrustAs the digital domain 
faces new and more 
threatening challenges, 
defenders are being 
driven to innovate and 
collaborate more closely 
than ever.5 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Sharing 
Microsofts 
unique 
vantage pointCybersecurity is a defining challenge of our time. 
Organizations of every size across every industry 
around the globe feel the urgency and pressure 
of protecting and defending against increasingly 
sophisticated attacks.While AI is transforming cybersecurity, using it to 
stay ahead of threats requires massive amounts 
of diverse data. Here at Microsoft, our more than 
10,000 security experts analyze over 65 trillion 
signals each day with the help of AI, and Microsoft 
Threat Intelligence teams track hundreds of threat 
actor groups worldwide. The Microsoft security 
ecosystem includes more than 15,000 security 
partners with specialized solutions, while the global 
open community of security researchers and testers 
contribute to bug bounties and security challenges. 
This broad, deep, and diverse security ecosystem 
is driving some of the most influential insights in 
cybersecurity. Together, we can build cyber resilience 
through innovative action and collective defense.As part of our longstanding commitment to create a safer world, Microsofts investments in security research, 
innovation, and the global security community include:Chapter 1Introduction65 trillion

in building cyber resilienceWe believe every individual and company 
around the world should be empowered 
to meet its security needs. Achieving this 
will require a collective global effort as 
we harness the power of partnership to 
strengthen our defenses together.Strength in numbers. Stronger together. Together 
we stand. Societies around the world recognize 
the benefits of collective behavior. The power 
of multistakeholder partnerships in cybersecurity, 
too, cannot be ignored as we seek to answer the 
question, What we can do to ensure a more safe 
and secure world for everyone on the planet?Individual organizations are often focused 
on safeguarding their own data and systems 
and protecting their customers, constituents, 
and communities.But partnerships act as a force multiplier for everyone 
involved in cybersecurity. Collaborative efforts among 
stakeholdersincluding government agencies, 
private sector entities, academia, nonprofits, and 
other organizationsare crucial in building resilient 
defenses against cyber threats.The cyber poverty lineTo understand the need for collaboration, it is useful 
to consider the concept of a cyber poverty line. 
In the same way that governments and economists 
establish a social poverty line to determine a bare 
minimum standard of living, the cyber poverty 
line is the minimum level of resources required for 
adequate protection from cyber threats. As we 
ponder the implication of the existence of a cyber 
poverty line, important questions begin to surface. 
How, exactly, do we quantify the cyber poverty line? 
Who is below it and how can we work together 
to support them to rise above it? These questions 
underscore the imperative of partnership in 
cybersecurity and serve as the genesis of meaningful 
conversations we must have.Public\-private partnerships, policy, 
and standardsThe opportunities for partnership across the 
public and private sectors, policy organizations, 
and standards bodies are multidimensional. 
From ensuring the technology community is building 
safer, more secure technology and collaborating 
on threat intelligence and trends to developing 
common standards to take down and block the 
tools cybercriminals use, strong and bi\-directional 
partnerships between organizations are crucial.As much as any individual companys shareholders 
would like it to be so, no one technology company 
can solve or overcome every cybersecurity 
challenge. Partnerships across the technology 
community are an absolute necessity to ensure 
organizations of all types and sizes, in every industry 
and region, can protect themselves. This means 
working together to push the boundaries of 
innovation, ensuring technical integration of 
products in the security space and addressing the 
endtoend security needs of customers.The concept of a cyber poverty
line allows us to identify the
minimum level of resources
required for adequate protection 
from cyber threats and who we must 
support to rise above it.Non\-profit, academia, and researchNonprofit, academia, and research organizations 
play a crucial role in advancing cybersecurity. 
By collaborating with industry partners, they 
bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge 
and practical application. Academic institutions 
contribute to cybersecurity research, develop 
innovative technologies, and educate the next 
generation of cybersecurity professionals. 
Collaborative research projects and initiatives 
between academia, nonprofits, and industry 
promote innovation and help tackle emerging 
cyber threats effectively.It is essential that stakeholders recognize their 
shared responsibility and actively engage in 
partnerships that enhance cybersecurity. History 
has already shown that by working together, 
we can build a safer digital future for individuals, 
organizations and nationsbut there is so much 
more to be done.For more about the power of partnerships, 
please see the Collective Defense chapter
on page 108\.Additional informationCollaboration is crucial to strengthening 
cybersecurity \| Microsoft On the Issues7 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023How can we 
protect against 
99% of attacks?While we explore the many dimensions of the 
cyber threat landscape, there is one crucial point 
we must emphasize across them all: the vast 
majority of successful cyberattacks could be 
thwarted by implementing a few fundamental 
security hygiene practices.By adhering to these minimum\-security standards, 
it is possible to protect against over 99 percent 
of attacks:1Enable multifactor authentication (MFA): 
This protects against compromised user 
passwords and helps to provide extra 
resilience for identities.2Apply Zero Trust principles:The cornerstone of any resilience plan 
is to limit the impact of an attack on an 
organization. These principles are: 
Explicitly verify. Ensure users and devices are in a 
good state before allowing access to resources. 
Use least privilege access. Allow only theprivilege that is needed for access to a resource 
and no more. 
Assume breach. Assume system defenses 
have been breached and systems may 
be compromised. This means constantly 
monitoring the environment for possible attack.3Use extended detection and response 
(XDR) and antimalware: Implement 
software to detect and automatically block 
attacks and provide insights to the security 
operations software. Monitoring insights 
from threat detection systems is essential 
to being able to respond to threats in a 
timely fashion
4Keep up to date: Unpatched and out\-
of\-date systems are a key reason many 
organizations fall victim to an attack. 
Ensure all systems are kept up to date 
including firmware, the operating system, 
and applications.5Protect data: Knowing your importantdata, where it is located, and whether the 
right defenses are implemented is crucial to 
implementing the appropriate protection.Hyperscale cloud makes it easier to implement 
fundamental security practices by either enabling 
them by default or abstracting the need for 

customers to implement them. With software\-as\-
a\-service (SaaS) and platform\-as\-a\-service (PaaS) 
solutions, the cloud provider takes responsibility for 
keeping up with patch management.Implementing security solutions like 
MFA or Zero Trust principles is simpler 
with hyperscale cloud because these 
capabilities are already built into the 
platform. Additionally, cloud\-enabled 
capabilities like XDR and MFA are 
constantly updated with trillions of daily 
signals, providing dynamic protection
that adjusts to the current 
threat landscape.Fundamentals 
of cyber hygiene99%Basic security hygiene 
still protects against 
99% of attacks.Chapter 1IntroductionHow effective is MFA at deterring 
cyberattacks? A recent study based on 
realworld attack data from Microsoft

through the Cybersecurity 
Tech AccordSince its inception, the Cybersecurity 
Tech Accord has witnessed remarkable 
progress. As we mark its fifth anniversary, 
we celebrate a groundbreaking 
commitment by 156 technology and 
security companies from around the 
world to protect our customers from 
malicious attacks by cybercriminals 
and nation states.The Cybersecurity Tech Accord has worked to 
be the technology industrys voice on matters of 
peace and security in cyberspace and to uphold 
a commitment to protect users and customers 
everywhere from evolving cyber threats. At the 
core of this historic initiative are four fundamental 
cybersecurity principles:1Better defense: We will protect all of ourusers and customers everywhere.2No offense: We will oppose cyberattacks 
on innocent citizens and enterprises 
from anywhere.3Capacity building: We will help empower 
users, customers, and developers to 
strengthen cybersecurity protection.4Collective action: We will partner with 
each other and likeminded groups to 
enhance cybersecurity.The Accord has launched several initiatives, including 
the Internet of Things (IoT) Security Resource Hub, 
which aims to establish a strong global baseline for IoT 
security in the next generation of consumer products. 
Signatories and industry partners have also embraced 
a set of principles to combat the menace of cyber 
mercenaries. The group also engages in extensive 
consultations with governments, civil society, and 
private sector partners, advocating for responsible 
nation\-state behavior and amplifying the technology 
industrys role in international cybersecurity.In the past year, the Cybersecurity Tech Accord 
has made strides in raising awareness of the 
escalating threats posed by some nation\-state 
actors. In particular, the group launched an Annual 
State of International Cybersecurity Thermometer, 
which in 2023 reached a boiling point, largely due 
to the widespread and unprecedented use of cyber 
operations in the armed conflict in Ukraine.The Cybersecurity Tech Accord has invested in 
promoting diversity, particularly empowering 
women in cybersecurity. Microsoft is proud to work 
with industry partners and nonprofit organizations 
worldwide to broaden access and foster the careers 
of women working in this critical field.To understand how topics discussed in this

descriptions 
and namingChapter 1IntroductionThreat actor naming taxonomyOther definitions:In April, we announced that we have shifted to 
a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned to 
the theme of weather. The complexity, scale, and 
volume of threats is increasing, driving the need to 
reimagine not only how Microsoft talks about threats 
but also how we enable customers to understand 
those threats quickly and with clarity. With the new 
taxonomy, we intend to bring better context to 
customers and security researchers that are already 
confronted with an overwhelming amount of threat 
intelligence data. It will offer a more organized, 
memorable, and easy way to reference adversary 
groups so that organizations can better prioritize 
threats and protect themselves. Simply put, security 
professionals will instantly have an idea of the type 
of threat actor they are up against, just by reading 
the name.Additional informationHow Microsoft names threat actors \| MicrosoftCyber\-enabled influence operations:Operations that combine offensive computer 
network operations with messaging and 
amplification in a coordinated and manipulative 
way to shift perceptions, behaviors, or 
decisions by target audiences to further a 
group or nations interests and objectives.NSN data: This data is based on aggregated 
nationstate notifications (NSNs)notices 
that we send to customers when they have 
been targeted or compromised by a nation\-
state actor that is tracked by Microsoft. 
Data overwhelmingly reflects activity 
against Office 365, followed by Outlook and 
Hotmail. We count NSN data by number of 
targeted organizations.Events data: This data covers a broader 
range of investigative observations of 
nationstate threat actor activity than NSNs. 
Activity captured in events ranges from 
reconnaissance and movement on network 
to data exfiltration or deletion.Throughout this report, we refer to the five key groups 
that Microsoft uses to characterize threat actors:Nation\-state actors are cyber operators who 
act on behalf of, or directed by, a nationstate\-
aligned program, irrespective of whether the 
goal is espionage, financial gain, or retribution.Financially motivated actors are cyber 
campaignsgroups directed by a criminal 
organizationperson with the motivation of 
financial gain which have not been associated 
with high confidence to a known nonnation 
state or commercial entity.Cyber mercenaries or private sectoroffensive actors refer to commercial actors that 
are knownlegitimate legal entities that create and 
sell cyberweapons to customers who select targets 
and operate the cyberweapons.Influence operations are manipulativeinformation campaigns communicated online 
or offline that are intended to shift perceptions, 
behaviors, or decisions by target audiences 
to further a group or a nations interests 
and objectives.Groups in development is a temporarydesignation given to an unknown, emerging, or

to track it as a discrete set of information until 
we can reach high confidence about the origin 
or identity of the actor behind the operation.11 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023About this report continuedThreat actors and types

cybercrimeIntroduction from Amy Hogan\-BurneyWhile cybercriminals have remained 
hard at work, we are seeing public and 
private sectors come together to disrupt 
the technologies criminals use, hold 
them to account, and support the victims 
of cybercrime.As a result, attackers are finding themselves in the 
crosshairs of law enforcement. Many have been 
outed, including the Conti ransomware operator 
known as Target whose unmasking includes a 
$10 million reward for additional information, indicted 
(Yevgeniy Polyanin) or arrested (Yaroslav Vasinskyi) 
alleged to have deployed the SodinokibiREvil 
ransomware to attack businesses and governments.As cybercriminals look for new ways to generate 
income, they have stayed focused on exploiting 
weakness in humans and technology, staying 
ahead of security measures, and coordinating 
to create sophisticated global networks that sell 
services. To combat them, public and private 
sector professionals and organizations are creating 
strong partnerships that are disrupting criminals 
technology, hold threat actors accountable, and 
increase resilience to attacks.Governments are also looking beyond criminals to 
rescue victims, disrupt malicious technology, and 
seize and return moneyas was seen in the case 
of the Hive ransomware. The private sector is an 
essential partner in these efforts, whether through 
criminal referrals and information sharing with law 
enforcement or through technical and legal action, 
as seen in Microsoft and Fortras action to disrupt 
cracked, legacy copies of Cobalt Strike and abused 
. 
see page 113
Microsoft softwareOpCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 124The result is that cybercriminals are looking for 
ways to increase their anonymity and effectiveness. 
As human\-operated ransomware attacks on small 
and medium businesses increase, we have seen 
more use of remote monitoring and management 
tools that leave behind less evidence. Many of these 
ransomware attacks attempt to compromise or gain 
access to unmanaged or bring\-your\-own devices 
because they typically have fewer security controls 
and defenses.Attackers continue to look for the easiest method 
to gain unauthorized access to any system through 
identity attacks such as traditional brute\-force 
attempts, sophisticated password spray attempts 
across multiple countries and IP addresses, 
and adversary\-in\-the middle (AiTM) attacks. 
Phishing is not going away, and attackers are using 
both malware phishing to compromise devices 
and AiTM phishing to steal identities that can beused in further criminal activity such as business 
email compromise.As you read this report, I encourage you to look 
for opportunities to improve your defensive 
security posture, identify areas where you may 
need investment, and explore ways to make 
training programs more effective. Consider your 
opportunities to engage in simulated cyberattacks 
or tabletop exercises, invest in threat intelligence 
and actor tracking in the cybercrime space, share 
information with law enforcement, and take technical 
or legal disruptive actions. We all have a part to play 
in fighting cybercrime, and I urge you to consider 
what more you, your company, or your government 
could do to help improve cyber resilience.Amy Hogan\-Burney 
General Manager, Associate General Counsel, 
Cybersecurity Policy \& Protection15Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeHow the threat
landscape is evolvingThe cyber threat landscape is continuing 
to evolve toward more effective and 
more damaging attacks, which often take 
place at scale. According to our data, 
organizations faced an overall increase 
in ransomware attacks compared to 
the previous year, while the number of 
human\-operated ransomware attacks 
almost doubled.13%of human\-operated ransomware attacks that 
moved into the ransom phase included some 
form of data exfiltration.This was accompanied by a sharp increase in the 
use of remote encryption during attacks. Using this 
method, an attacker encrypts a file on a different 
computer, and then sends the encrypted file to the 
original computer. This can happen if one computer 
on a network is hacked and has access to another 
computer with the compromised user account(s). 
No additional software is needed on the original 
computer, and no harmful files are left behind.Data extortion is also on the rise. Since November 
2022, we observed a doubling of potential data 
exfiltration instancesthe theft or unauthorized 
removal or movement of data from a device. 
Thirteen percent of human\-operated ransomware 
attacks that moved into the ransom phase had some 
form of data exfiltration.The frequency of business email compromise 
(BEC) attacks has skyrocketed to over 156,000 daily 
attempts. Microsoft Entra data shows attempted 
password attacks increased more than tenfold in 2023, 
from around 3 billion per month to over 30 billion. 
This translates to an average of 4,000 blocked attacks 
per second targeting Microsoft cloud identities.16Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeWhat we can 
learn from attack 
notificationsManaged extended detection and 
response (XDR) services, such as 
Microsoft Defender Experts, are 
invaluable resources for security 
operations centers to effectively detect 
and respond to critical incidents.When we observe novel tactics, techniques, and 
procedures, human\-directed attacks, or attack 
progression, notifications are sent to our customers 
to provide specific information regarding the scope, 
method of entry, and instructions for remediation.PrCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 124Based on the notifications shared with

ransomware activity or attempted attacks 
that we have detected and prevented or 
alerted on, throughout the various stages 
of a ransomware attack.In addition to several ransomware variants 
this year, we observed a unique large\-
scale ransomware campaign targeting 
both endpoints and cloud architecture of 
an organization. This was driven by the 
threat actor we named Mango Sandstorm. 
This campaign included both on\-premises 
and cloud environments, and involved 
privilege escalation and destruction 
activities, including deletion of victim user 
resources, and persistence using OAuth 
applications. Attackers added a secret or 
certificate to an application in order to 
connect to Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) as the application, and perform 
operations (such as reading confidential 
data and emails, exfiltrating information 
through emails) leveraging the application 
permissions that are assigned to it.For more about ransomware

Defense evasion techniques included 
phishing from compromised vendors and 
abuse of legitimate services.For more about phishing and
AiTM, see page 27\. 4Business email compromise (BEC):Attackers used various methods including 
email conversation hijacking and mass 
spamming with malicious applications 
to commit financial fraud. They also sent 
phishing emails with harmful links and 
attachments from the victims email 
address to other users within the victims 
organization. Since these phishing emails 
were sent internally, multiple users fell 
victim to the attack by clicking on the links 
within a short period of time.For more about BEC, see page 32\.DBAA42% Successful

The number of affiliates grew by 12 percent in the 
last year, setting up conditions for human\-operated 
ransomware attacks to continue to grow in 2024\.Microsofts telemetry indicates that 
organizations faced an increased rate of 
ransomware attacks compared to last 
year, with the number of human\-operated 
ransomware attacks up more than 200 
percent since September 2022\.The good news is, for organizations with a strong 
security posture, the likelihood of an attack 
succeeding is very low. Typically, an attack is 
stopped in the pre\-ransom phase, with on average 
2 percent of attacks progressing to a successful 
ransomware deployment.Approximately 40 percent of the ransomware

Protection, Microsoft Defender Threat IntelligenceRemote encryptionIn a notable change from last year, we observed 
a sharp increase in the use of remote encryption 
during human\-operated ransomware attacks. 
Instead of deploying malicious files on the victim 
device, encryption is done remotely, with the system 
process performing the encryption, which renders 
process\-based remediation ineffective. On average, 
60 percent of human\-operated ransomware attacks 
used remote encryption over the past year. This is 
a sign of attackers evolving to further minimize 
their footprint.Initial attack vectorsThe Microsoft Incident Response team responds 
to incidents and helps customers secure their most 
sensitive, critical environments. Based on findings 
during these engagements, the top three initial 
access vectors were fairly evenly split, showing 
criminals are consistently exploiting the same 
vectors: external remote services, valid accounts, and 
public facing applications.We found that among external remote services, 
adversaries primarily leveraged unsecured remote 
desktop protocol (RDP) and virtual private networks 
(VPN). Threat actors attacking valid accounts, where 
the attacker somehow gained legitimate account 
credentials, were most often able to log in via Citrix.Among vulnerable external facing applications, 
cybercriminals exploited vulnerabilities ranging 
from zero\-day vulnerabilities to those that were two 
to three years old, with Zoho Java ManageEngine, 
Exchange, MOVEit, and PaperCut print management 
software among the top applications exploited.Actionable insightsTo safeguard against these attacks:1It is crucial to implement Zero Trust and 
least privilege principles.2The most efficient solutions are those 
that can instantly identify attackers by 
utilizing signals from devices, users, 
and the entire organization, and take 
automatic remedial measures across 
both managed and unmanaged devices.3It is essential to have a seamless 
method to restore encrypted files at the 
organizational level.Additional informationHow automatic attack disruption works in

targetingUnmanaged devicesMost human\-operated ransomware 
attacks attempt to compromise or gain 
access to unmanaged or bring\-your\-
own devices (personal devices used 
to access work\-related systems and 
information). These typically have fewer 
security controls and defenses. We have 
observed that 80 to 90 percent of all 
compromises originate from unmanaged 
devices. Ransomware operators are also 
increasingly exploiting vulnerabilities 
in less common software, making it 
more difficult to predict and defend 
against their attacks. This reinforces 
the importance of a holistic 
security approach.Organization sizeDespite the notoriety of high\-profile attacks 
last year, the primary victims of ransomware 
attacks this year were small and medium size 
organizations. Between July and September 2022, 
around 70 percent of organizations encountering 
human\-operated ransomware had fewer than 
500 employees.IndustriesWhile the critical infrastructure sectors experienced 
the most ransomware encounters this year, 
cybercriminals have broadly attacked all sectors. 
Attackers leveraged new techniques as pre\-cursors 
to ransomware to establish the foothold within 
the victim organization before exfiltration and 
ransom. As seen in the distribution of pre\-ransom 
notifications sent by Microsoft Defender Experts 
to our customers, education and manufacturing 
sectors were key targets. For example, threat 
actors targeted a critical remote code execution 
vulnerability found in PaperCut server, which is used 
by educational organizations.70%of organizations encountering

Cl21 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeHow cybercriminals 
are using remote 
monitoring and 
management toolsAttackers continue to abuse legitimate 
remote monitoring and management 
(RMM) software for post\-compromise 
activity such as information\-stealing 
and delivering malicious payloads 
like ransomware. Microsoft incident 
responders found that 17 percent of 
intrusions involved known RMM tools.In addition to providing attackers with persistent 
access to compromised systems, RMM software 
allows significant permissions that enable attackers 
to launch PowerShell commands or run scripts with 
system\-level privileges. Threat actors can also abuse 
RMM software to copy files to a clipboard and 
exfiltrate data using a file transfer web service.Because managed service providers, IT support, 
and system administrators use RMM software 
for legitimate purposes, it is often permitted 
by application controls. This makes automated 
detection of its use in an attack difficult. Its presence 
often blends in with common activity, buying 
the attacker time and complicating incident 
response as defenders may overlook the software. 
Organizations that do not use RMM software can 
defend against its abuse during an attack by using 
application control policies or perimeter network 
blocking rules.17%of intrusions involved 
known RMM tools.Actionable insight1If your organization does not use 
RMM software, you can protect 
against its abuse during an attack 
by implementing application control 
policies or perimeter network 
blocking rules.Spotlight on 
cryptojackingCryptojacking is the unauthorized use of other 
peoples devices to mine cryptocurrency. It generally 
does not trigger an incident response; rather, the 
criminal activity is often detected while investigating 
a separate incident. We observed evidence of 
current or past coin mining activity in 4\.2 percent 
of all our engagements during the year. In these 
incidents, responders identified the presence of 
XMRig mining malware or the creation of virtual 
machines within a customers subscription for 
coin mining.Cryptojacking slows down an infected device, uses 
its resources, can steal information, and decreases 
overall performance.Microsoft Defender Experts has identified the 
following Linux hosted application vulnerabilities 
being exploited for cryptojacking:Additional informationCryptojacking: Understanding and defending

data exfiltrationData exfiltration involves the unauthorized removal 
or movement of data from a device. Since November 
2022, we have observed a doubling of potential data 
exfiltration instances after threat actors compromised 
an environment. This growth is consistent with the 
rise in double and triple extortion activity after 
ransomware attacks that we and the broader security 
community have observed in the past several years.Not all data theft is associated with ransomware; it 
can also be part of credential harvesting or nation\-
state espionage. Stopping data exfiltration therefore 
requires a broader approach than focusing solely on 
preventing ransomware payload deployment and 
backup deletion.InfostealersInformation stealers (infostealers) are malicious 
software designed to steal data stored in browsers. 
Such data includes session tokens and cookies which 
can include multifactor authentication (MFA) claims, 
saved passwords and input form data, credit card 
information, user files, and cryptocurrency wallets. 
They can also harvest credentials for internet\-facing 
systems and applications including VPN, RDP, virtual 
desktop infrastructure including Citrix, and identity 
providers such as Azure Active Directory and Okta.In some instances, infostealers act as loaders for 
other malware.As infostealers have become more prevalent in the last 
two years, they have increased as a risk to enterprise 
security. For example, an unmanaged device might 
lead to corporate compromise after an employee 
syncs their workplace credentials with infected home 
devices from browsers that are signed in.Infostealers are advertised as a malware\-as\-a\-service 
offering. The infostealer ecosystem is a multi\-
tiered business model usually involving three or 
four entities:The developeroperator develops the malware,operates its infrastructure, and sells the 
malware build to multiple distributors.The distributor uses the build to createinfostealer payloads, deploys the infostealer 
in phishing or malvertising campaigns, 
downloads the infostealer output from the 
operators centralized infrastructure, and 
is responsible for getting customers and 
developing a monetization strategy, which 
usually includes posting the output onto online 
credential marketplaces.The credential marketplace advertises stolen 
credentials for purchase. These online forums 
include Russian Market, Genesis Market, and 
Industrial Spy Market.The customer purchases infostealer outputfrom the distributor or credential marketplace.The infostealer ecosystem has enabled a new 
group of threat actors that leverage these tools to 
exfiltrate data and destroy resources. Such threat 
actors include Karakurt, the now\-inactive Strawberry 
Tempest (DEV\-0537, formerly LAPSUS$), Storm\-0875 
(0ktapus), Storm\-0829 (Nwgen Team), Storm\-0744, 
and Storm\-0971\.Data extortionRansomware operators have multiple opportunities 
to monetize their attacks, all of which are linked 
to dataencrypting, deleting, or publishing it. 
Because of the sensitivity of many organizations 
data, some threat actors have turned to exfiltrating 
data for ransom without ever deploying an actualransomware payload. Microsoft has observed that 
while approximately 16 percent of recent successful 
human\-operated ransomware attacks involved 
both encryption and exfiltration, 13 percent used 
exfiltration only.To exfiltrate data, attackers often leverage open\-
source data management and synchronization tools 
such as Rclone and MEGAsync. These tools are 
freely available for legitimate purposes and allow 
large volumes of data to be uploaded to remote 
cloud resources. Given that many RaaS programs 
include a suite of data extortion support offerings 
including leak site hosting, payment pressure, and 
cryptocurrency transaction servicesit is easier than 
ever for cybercriminals to monetize data exfiltration.Instances of potential exfiltration500,000450,000400,000350,000300,000250,000200,000150,000100,00050,0000Nov 22Dec 22Jan 23Feb 23Mar 23Apr 23May 23Jun 23Jul 23Sources: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention, Microsoft Defender

the victim may determine that they must pay 
the ransom because of the critical nature of 
the encrypted data and their lack of back\-ups. 
Based on the work of the DCU and its NCFTA 
partners however, the company decides to 
coordinate payment with law enforcement. After the 
victim pays, law enforcement tracks the funds and 
works with cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze the 
cryptocurrency before the ransomware group can 
withdraw it.Law enforcement then returns the money to the 
victim through the appropriate legal process. 
Additional investigations may lead to the arrest and 
prosecution of the criminals.Given the complexity and global nature of 
ransomware attacks and other cybercrime activity, 
this collaborative approach is necessary to disrupt 
the finances of criminals, at scale. Microsoft and 
the DCU are leading efforts with partners and 
will continue to develop technology and legal 
approaches to bring threat actors to justice.Disrupting the 
financial networks 
of cybercriminals: 
a hypothetical 
case studyOne of the best ways to deter 
cybercriminals is to hit them where it 
hurts: in their wallets. The Microsoft 
Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) has been doing 
that through a holistic strategy which 
places financial disruption at the core of 
its investigations.Going after the financial networks of cybercriminals 
means leveraging advanced analytics and tools 
to identify bad actor assets, working with public 
and private sector partners, and scaling the use of 
traditional and new legal approaches to disrupt the 
financial flows of the cybercrime ecosystem. Heres 
what that might look like:Microsoft identifies a suspected ransomware attack 
and proactively contacts the impacted customer. 
The customer confirms its files were encrypted and 
that it received a ransom demand to be paid to a 
cryptocurrency wallet. Microsoft works with the 
victim on incident response while the DCU analyzes 
the attacker and their virtual wallet. Using tools 
provided by industry partners who specialize in 
analyzing cryptocurrency transactions, the DCU 
identifies more of the threat actors wallets and 
technical details of their communications.With the victims permission, Microsoft uses its 
membership in the National Cyber Forensics and 
Training Alliance (NCFTA)a non\-profit organization 
that unites industry and government partners to 
combat cybercrimeto share this information 
quickly and securely. The group confirms the actor 
is a known ransomware group and provides details 
including other wallets and infrastructure the 
cybercriminals use.OpPaCybersecurity Tech Accord principles 
mapping index on page 124Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit24Collaboration 
to disrupt the 
ransomware 
business modelOne recommendation of the 
Ransomware Task Force (RTF), of 
which Microsoft is a part, is to disrupt 
the ransomware business model and 
decrease criminal profits. In pursuit 
of this goal, the Institute of Security 
and Technology (IST) mapped the 
ransomware payment ecosystem 
in 2022\.Additional informationMapping the Ransomware Ecosystem \| Institute 
for Security and TechnologyThe Ransomware Task Force (RTF) unites key 
stakeholders across industry, government, and 
civil societyThis groundbreaking identification of the actors, 
processes, and information involved in the 
ransomware payment ecosystem illuminates how 
the ransom payment moves from the victim to the 
ransomware actor to be obfuscated, cashed out, 
and reinvested.The laundering process spans cryptocurrency 
companies, virtual asset service providers (VASPs), 
peer\-to\-peer and cryptocurrency exchanges, 
mixers, merchant services, and dark net markets, 
among other entities. IST found that previously 
un\-leveraged information is produced as a ransom 
payment moves through the chain. This information 
can be accessed and potentially shared by a range 
of entities including, but not limited to, antivirus 
vendors, cloud service providers, hosting providers, 
cryptocurrency exchanges, and tooling providers. 
Efforts coordinated by the RTF and NCFTA, among 
others, can also use this information to add friction 
toand potentially disruptthe ransomware payment 
ecosystem. The ultimate goal is to disincentivize 
the use of ransomware by making it harder for 
ransomware operators to successfully collect on 
their attacks.Defending against 
future ransomware 
trendsAs of May 2023, 92 percent of the RTF 
recommendations for combatting ransomware 
had been actioned in some way, with 50 percent 
experiencing significant progress, including 
through legislation and policy adoption.1 Just as 
defenders are innovating, however, ransomware 
operators are too. As a result, Microsoft is 
focused on understanding how ransomware 
activity may develop over the next few years to 
proactively counter it. Going forward, we expect 
cyber criminals will seek to leverage automation, 
AI, and hyperscale cloud systems to scale and 
to maximize the profitability of ransomware 
attacks. Organizations looking to minimize their 
vulnerabilities to these approaches must respond 
by modernizing their organizational skills, mindset, 
approach, and technology.Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeActionable insights1Modernize cybersecurity skills: Use AIto augment human cyber defense skills 
and capabilities for organizations and 
for collective defense. AI can also be 
used to expedite the time to detect 
and respond to ransomware attacks.2Modernize mindset: Organizations 
should understand the benefits of 
innovations in the public cloud, which 
includes hyper\-scalability cybersecurity 
capabilities, to protect digital platforms 
from cybercriminals and nation\-
state attackers.3Modernize approach: Cybersecurity 
can no longer be seen as a technical 
problem; for greater resilience it must 
be seen as an organizational risk 
by leaders in the organization and 
managed accordingly.4Modernize approach: Legacytechnology and siloed standalone 
security products are not efficient 
or effective at defending against 
sophisticated cyber attackers. 
Organizations should invest in 
integrated cybersecurity platforms 
that share signals across the digital 
backbone to provide end\-to\-end 
visibility and inform defenders across 
an organizations surface attack area. Microsoft Digital Defense Report 202325Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeWhat is the Optimal 
Ransomware 
Resiliency State?Microsofts mission to keep ourselves 
and our customers safe from 
ransomware continually evolves and
grows. A resilient defense is particularly 
important as ransomware operators
increasingly shift toward hands\-
on\-keyboard attacks that enable
sophisticated cybercriminals to seek 
out and exploit vulnerabilities.OpCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 124Despite developments in the ransomware space, 
the overall approach of our Ransomware Elimination 
Program remains the same: to deter or counter 
ransomware attacks by removing opportunities for 
financial gain by threat actors.In last years report, we introduced our two\-pillar 
approach to ransomware, with dedicated initiatives 
to support our enterprise and our customers. 
This year, our efforts resulted in three key outcomes:Continuous improvement for businesscontinuity and recovery: We emphasized 
the role of employees in our defense strategy 
through tabletop exercises and rigorous 
simulations to verify our protective capabilities, 
supported by training for excellence in incident 
response preparedness.Advanced evaluation of ransomware\-specific 
controls: Integrating new methodologies, we 
developed a ransomware\-specific technology 
evaluation program to ensure controls meet 
the requirements of our enterprise.Improved feedback loops: We streamlined 
engagement between our security operating 
center and the product groups that build the 
security tools that Microsoft and its customers 
rely on. This provided richer insights with more 
actionable data and improved our ransomware 
protection and detection capabilities in the 
products and services we used.Over the coming year, we will continue to iterate and 
develop our processes to further reduce the risk of 
ransomware impact on our environment.How we can build resilience
against ransomwareOur approach aims to ensure that our internal 
products, services, and teamsincluding those 
supporting our customerswill be best positioned 
to defend against ransomware attacks today and in 
the future.To optimize resilience, we conducted an internal 
assessment using the National Institute of Standards 
and Technologys published framework for managing 
the risk of ransomware (NIST.IR.8374\). Based on the 
results, and in conjunction with data and observations 
of real\-world human\-operated ransomware, we have 
established a comprehensive set of requirements 
across different technology domains to defend 
against ransomware attacks. We call this our Optimal 
Ransomware Resiliency State (ORRS).Integrating what we have learned from our Zero 
Trust journey, ORRS consists of 40\+ requirements 
that span myriad aspects of the security landscape, 
from policy and governance to infrastructure and 
data. The requirements are platform agnostic 
to ensure compatibility with any device that we 
mandate and include employee training, and 
ensuring business continuity and data accessibility.We believe that ransomware resiliency should be 
available to all organizations, regardless of size or 
industry. Over the coming months, were focused on 
the implementation experience of ORRS with new, 
streamlined requirements that ensure resiliency and 
performance are not compromised.The five foundations of the 
ransomware elimination journeyWe have identified five foundational principles which 
we believe every enterprise should implement to 
defend against ransomware. When fully implemented, 
the Foundational Five provide proven defenses 
across identity, data, and endpoints. While we 
make exclusive use of our first\-party products, the 
Foundational Five are solution\-agnostic if they are 
properly implemented and fully enabled.The Foundational Five1\.Modern authentication with phish\-resistant credentials2\.Least Privileged Access applied to theentire technology stack3\.Threat\- and risk\-free environments4\.Posture management for compliance and

as a venue where these principles are 
accessible quickly with low cost and 
low complexity.A call to actionRansomware attackers are motivated by 
easy profits, so adding to their cost via 
security hardening is key in disrupting the 
cybercriminal economy.1Focus on user identity, device health, andaccess control to prevent lateral movement 
and privilege escalation in the network.2Implement a Zero Trust approach to reduce 
the attack surface and improve resilience 
against cyber threats. By adopting this model, 
organizations can increase the cost to attackers 
and limit the impact of successful intrusions, 
thus reducing the blast radius.3Keep cybersecurity fundamentals up to date 
and leverage cloud\-based tools for faster 
threat detection and response.4Establish a ransomware defense strategy to 
mitigate the impact of extortion attacks that 
are becoming more frequent and damaging. 
Implementing a plan should be a priority 
especially because of the near certainty that an 
organization will experience at least one attack 
in the next few years. Microsoft Digital Defense Report 202327Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeInsights on phishingAnatomy of an AiTM phishing attackAdversary\-in\-
the\-middle 
phishing attacksAdversary\-in\-the\-middle (AiTM) is 
a longstanding technique used by 
threat actors to obtain credentials, 
session cookies or personal data, or to 
distribute malware.We have consistently observed a daily influx of 
high\-volume AiTM phishing campaigns, with some 
instances involving millions of phishing emails sent 
within a 24\-hour period. This trend of high\-volume 
campaigns first appeared in September 2021 and we 
saw a significant surge in mid\-July 2022, indicating 
an effort to bypass MFA on a massive scale. 
Unlike traditional phishing attacks, revoking andresetting user account credentials is not enough to 
address AiTM phishing incidents. The stolen session 
cookies also need to be revoked because session 
cookies, which are data stored in browsers, grant 
privileged access without repeated authentication.During an AiTM phishing attack, a reverse proxy 
server is set up between the target and a legitimate 
login page. Reverse proxy servers sit between a 
client, such as a web browser, and a web server, 
forwarding information and requests between 
the client and the server. Reverse proxies are used 
legitimately for increasing security and performance 
but can also be used for malicious purposes such as 
AiTM attacks. The target unwittingly submits their 
credentials through the proxy, which triggers an 
MFA prompt on their mobile device. After the user 
inputs the authentication code, the proxy continues 
to deceive them by presenting subsequent MFA 
screens, relaying the users input and allowing 
the attacker to access the account without the 
users knowledge.User1User puts their

login page, as in traditional phishing methods. 
However, a separate server controlled by the threat 
actor or phishing service is used to submit the stolen 
credentials to the legitimate login service, triggering 
an MFA prompt. The phishing infrastructure then 
displays a copy of an MFA screen to the target. 
This is distinct from AiTM over reverse proxy, as no 
HTTP packets are proxied between the target and 
the login service.Microsoft tracks multiple threat actor groups 
associated with prominent AiTM phishing kits 
and services and one prolific threat actor using 
multiple AiTM phishing services to carry out high 
volume phishing campaigns. These prominent 
kitsservices are known as Caffeine (attributed to 
Storm\-0867\), EvilProxy (attributed to Storm\-0835\), 
and NakedPages (attributed to Storm\-1101\). We have 
also observed AiTM phishing campaigns linked to 
tracked but unidentified kits or services.While other kitssuch as Evilginx2, Modlishka, and 
Muraenahave been available for free in open 
sources for years, they lack the service and support 
offered by paid\-for kits. As a result, the addition 
of AiTM phish kits to phishing\-as\-a\-service has 
supplied advanced phishing capabilities to a wider 
range of threat actors, reduced entry barriers, and 
enabled more effective attacks.Caffeine, EvilProxy, and NakedPages each have 
hundreds of customers. These cyber criminals pay 
monthly license fees ranging from $200 to $1,000 
USD and carry out daily phishing campaigns. 
Because so many threat actors use these services, 
it is impractical to attribute campaigns to specific 
actors. Instead, we track these phishing services, 
block phishing activity from them, and work 
to provide effective detection and defense 
for customers.Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeAiTM domains growing as attacks become more common

such as Adobe, Dropbox, Google, and Microsoft. 
After multiple redirects, victims are led to the 
final landing page, which steals credentials ordownloads malicious payloads onto their machine.

also observed targeted phishing attempts in which 
attackers identified user\-specific details through 
social engineering, then created tailored phishing 
campaigns using look\-alike domains to which the 
users have subscribed, with contents matching 
the users interests. This significantly increases the 
success rate of a compromise attempt.10,000In April\-June 2023 we alerted users of

we observe trends in file entities that are commonly 
used in phishing attacks. HTML files are often used 
for creating fake web pages that trick users into 
divulging personal information. PDF files can exploit 
a users trust by embedding malicious links or using 
social engineering tactics to persuade users to 
open attachments that execute malware. URLs are 
commonly used to deceive users into visiting 
fraudulent websites.This year, we observed major attack patterns 
involving URLs with open redirectors and open 
shorteners being dominant attack vectors.URL open redirectors are vulnerabilities found in web 
applications that enable attackers to manipulate URLs 
to redirect unsuspecting users to malicious websites.

behavior in phishing 
simulationsPhishing campaigns continue to improve 
in sophistication, including leveraging 
genuine services or websites and
tailoring phishing links for individual 
users. By simulating user interaction 
in virtual machines, we can analyze 
untrusted files and URLs to assess their 
safety. The main goal is to deliver speedy 
and accurate verdicts on content.The fundamentals of phishing havent changed 
over time; approximately 90 percent of phishing 
attacks involve social engineering. This is primarily 
conducted through email that leads the victim 
to reveal sensitive information, click a malicious 
link, or open a malicious file. Phishing attacks are 
cost\-effective for attackers, adaptable to evade 
prevention measures, and boast high success rates. 
Compromise rates range from single digits to 40 
percent, influenced by a wide range of variables 
from simulation difficulty to user type. We evaluatedattack simulation training data from tens of 
millions of users to gain insights into the impact of 
phishing training.Why is phishing such a challenge?Humans remain the primary risk vector in social 
engineering attacks. At the same time, phishing 
attack mechanisms are constantly evolving, and bad 
actors create new tactics. Users often click on links 
and attachments by habit and without conscious 
consideration of their actions, thereby opening the 
door to cybercrime. Three factors explain why users 
remain a key vulnerability:1As threat tactics rapidly evolve, technical 
systems will not be able to completely 
prevent social engineering attacks 
and human behavior will persist as a 
vulnerability for attackers to manipulate.2While security awareness programs, 
designed to help users identify social 
engineering attacks and respond 
appropriately have some success, often it is 
not the users lack of knowledge that drives 
phishing susceptibility.3So far, users have not demonstratedthe ability to consistently change their 
behavioral risk tendencies enough to show 
measurable improvement against an ever\-
evolving threat landscape.Users are particularly vulnerable to drive\-by URL attacks. These involve simple link\-clicks that take victims to 
websites that collect telemetry or entice the user to a downstream attack. Whereas a credential harvest attack 
involves two clicksone to get to the credential harvesting page and another to enter the credentialsa 
drive\-by requires just one click. Drive\-by URL attacks are usually less impactful, but many organizations use 
them to measure their click susceptibility.Phish simulation training findings show users vulnerable to drive\-by URLs

Most enterprise phishing awareness programs 
prioritize meeting training compliance requirements 
over delivering effective behavior change programs. 
They operate under the misguided assumption that 
periodic exposure to simulated phishing attacks, 
accompanied by a brief educational encounter 
(typically in the form of a narrated video with limited 
interactive elements), will equip users to be able to 
identify and avoid advanced and evolving phishing 
attempts. However, these programs have proven to 
be fundamentally flawed.Although tens of millions of computer users have 
taken phishing training, we have found that phish 
clicking behavior is reduced by employing video\-
based training by about three percent, at best. 
This number has remained remarkably stable over 
the years. Based on this data, we conclude that 
video\-based training is not an effective way to 
reduce an organizations phish susceptibility.Tailored approaches are neededThe security awareness and training industry is 
beginning to adopt objective behavioral measures and 
contextual experiences that prioritize behavior change 
over information delivery. This involves tailoring the 
approach to individual users. We believe this approach 
holds the greatest potential for reducing behavioral 
risk against modern social engineering attacks. 
Under this approach, organizations must embrace a 
new perspective regarding the involvement of their 
users in thwarting attacks and conduct innovative 
experimentation with user engagement strategies.To truly tackle the issue of phishing, its important 
to recognize that every user is unique and has their 
own behavioral tendencies. Our phishing awareness 
programs go beyond generic, one\-size\-fits\-all 
training and instead provide tailored and context\-
aware engagement models that can be implemented 
at scale. We understand that each user requires a 
personalized learning experience based on their 
unique behaviors and profile, such as job function, 
security posture, and past actions. For example, 
our phish simulations are tailored to each users 
performance based on telemetry from previous 
simulations sent. Providing personalized learning 
experiences based on each individuals unique 
behaviors and profile can enable organizations to 
make a real impact in reducing phish susceptibility.Percentage of clicks on phish simulations 
Link\-clicking behavior by users has remained 
relatively unchanged despite the widespread 
implementation of security awareness training 
programs, and increased sophistication of phish.10%

simulation training dataInaction is better than clicking, but reporting is 
the best action to take. 
Reporting phishing attempts is crucial to prevent 
cyberattacks. Users can help security teams 
identify and block malicious emails, websites, and 
other threats. However, only 11\.3 percent of users 
who receive phishing emails report them, despite 
89 percent refraining from clicking on links or 
opening attachments.Administrators can use awareness campaigns, 
teaching guides, and rewards to raise awareness 
of phishing campaigns and encourage consistent 
reporting behavior. There is a genuine opportunity for 
organizations to prioritize enhancing user reporting 
consistency, as current rates fall short of potential.User responses to phish attempts 
still insufficientEmployees must also know how to recognize 
and respond to evolving phishing techniques.

email compromiseBusiness email compromise (BEC) is 
a sophisticated scam which targets 
businesses and individuals performing
transfers of funds.The scam is frequently carried out when a threat 
actor compromises legitimate business email 
accounts through social engineering or computer 
intrusion techniques to conduct unauthorized 
funds transfers to accounts under their own control. 
The incidence of BEC attacks has skyrocketed, 
reaching an astonishing count of over 156,000 daily 
attempts between April 2022 to April 2023\.2In 2022, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
Internet Crime Complaint Center recorded adjusted 
losses of over USD 2\.7 billion for 21,832 BEC 
complaints filed.3156,000 dailyBEC attempts observed April 2022\-April 2023Common BEC 
attack activityFinancial fraud. Microsoft Defender Experts have 
observed attackers creating domain impersonations 
to deceive users into thinking they are engaging 
with legitimate third parties for financial transactions. 
In some cases, attackers compromise the third party 
and respond on the same email thread to request 
money transfers. These attacks are challenging 
to detect as they originate from genuine third\-
party emails.Lateral movement through internal phishing.
After compromising identities with AiTM, many threat 
actors then launch internal phishing campaigns. 
Microsoft Defender Experts have witnessed large\-
scale internal phishing campaigns targeting over 
8,000 recipients. Since these emails are internal 
and sent from legitimate senders, it increases the 
likelihood that users will be duped by the scam.Mass spam mailing activity. This attack aims to 
disrupt users through a denial\-of\-service strategy. 
Attackers subscribe the victim users email address 
to multiple lists, forums, message boards, and 
newsletters, resulting in the victim receiving an 
overwhelming number of emails, sometimes 
exceeding 1000 per minute. When this occurs, the 
victim is distracted and frustrated, often unable 
to notice legitimate warning or authentication
messages in their overwhelmed inbox.How BEC is evolvingAs Microsofts cloud services continue to evolve 
through innovative breakthroughs, threat actors are 
adapting their social engineering techniques and 
use of technology to carry out more sophisticated 
and costly BEC attacks. The success of these attacks 
is largely due to the growing targeting of cloud\-
based infrastructure, exploitation of trusted business 
relationships, and development of more specialized 
skills by the threat actors. Microsofts Digital Crimes 
Unit (DCU) believes that increased intelligence 
sharing across the public and private sectors will 
enable a faster and more impactful response against 
the threat actors behind these attacks.Expanded abuse of cloud\-based infrastructureThe agility and power of cloud services that 
benefit customers have also been weaponized by 
cybercriminals. For instance, the DCU has observed 
threat actors abuse the portability of domain 
names and power of Microsoft 365 services (such 
as resiliency, orchestration, control, and scale) in 
multiple stages of BEC attacks, from reconnaissance 
to phishing to payment fraud. The use of 
impersonation domains, known as homoglyph
domains, is also still prevalent. These allow BEC 
attackers to tailor email communication for social 
engineering. Homoglyph domains are often
ported from third\-party registrars and configured 
with M365 mail services to create mailboxes that 
impersonate legitimate key accounting employees. Microsoft Digital Defense Report 202333Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeExploitation of trusted business relationships: 
Vendor email compromiseBEC attacks are evolving past simple email account 
compromise rooted in social engineering tactics 
that circumvent payment controls by exploiting 
supplier business relationships. A more successful 
type of attack is called Vendor Email Compromise 
(VEC). VEC occurs when a companys suppliers are 
targeted and exploited by threat actors who hijack 
email threads from the companys compromised 
email accounts and use them to change payment 
information for an upcoming transaction.The hijacked email threads are often copied to 
attacker\-managed mailboxes created with homoglyph 
domains and used in illicit communication.Threat actors are up\-skillingThe structure of organized criminal networks 
perpetrating BEC attacks is also evolving, along with 
the skills of the threat actors who make up these 
organizations. BEC criminal networks predominantly 
originate from Africa and range from a hierarchical 
organization with top\-down command, such as the 
Black Axe group, to loosely organized networks 
managed regionally, commonly known as zones. 
Many zone actors move to industrialized countries for 
technical education and work experience, then use 
their new knowledge to carry out more sophisticated 
attacks, such as VEC. DCU has observed some zones 
are organized by roles and use specialized skills to 
improve the efficacy of their attacks. In these instances, 
threat actors may be involved in one or more roles.Intelligence sharing builds resilienceOther types of BEC attacksBEC threat actor rolesIntelligence sharing improves our collective 
ability to identify and respond to BEC attacks, 
helping to increase resilience in the face of these 
threats. Mapping out malicious infrastructure 
and developing threat actor intelligence gives 
stakeholders a better understanding of the tools, 
techniques and procedures used by cybercriminals. 
This enables more holistic disruption of their 
supply chain and coordinated role structure. 
Threat intelligence also improves investigation 
prioritization and informs the targeting and 
disruption of the more advanced and prolific 
criminal networks.We are supporting the Cybercrime Atlas 
Initiative that brings together global leaders 
to fight cybercrime. For more about this

After a notable increase in the number of password\-based attacks per month in October 2022, the number 
skyrocketed in 2023\. In April, there were 11,000 attacks per second, a tenfold increase from the same time 
last year.The first quarter of 2023 saw a dramatic 
surge in password\-based attacks 
against cloud identities, especially in the 
education sector.We blocked an average
of 4,000 password
attacks per second over 
the past year.According to Microsoft Entra data, the number of 
attempted attacks increased more than tenfold 
compared to the same period in 2022, from around 
3 billion per month to over 30 billion. This translates 
to an average of 4,000 password attacks per second 
targeting Microsoft cloud identities this year.One of the main reasons password attacks are 
so prevalent is the low security posture of many 
organizations, especially in the education sector. 
Many of these organizations have not enabled MFA 
for their users, leaving them vulnerable to phishing, 
credential stuffing, and brute force attacks.50403020s

JSource: Microsoft Entra data Microsoft Digital Defense Report 202335Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeUse of one\-time 
password botsMFA adds an extra layer of security, but 
cybercriminals can still find ways to bypass it. 
One way is by using one\-time password bots 
(OTP bots) to gain access and perform account 
takeovers. OTP bots extract authentication codes 
from users by tricking them into providing the OTP 
sent to them via SMS, authentication apps, or email. 
The cybercriminal loads the victims phone number 
into the OTP bot, which calls the victim and pretends 
to be a legitimate service provider. The bot tells the 
victim there has been suspicious activity on their 
account and asks them to enter the OTP for security 
verification. The entered password is then sent back 
to the cybercriminal, granting them access to the 
victims account.While robocalls are a common method used by OTP 
bots, email phishing for authentication codes is also 
employed. The cybercriminal must act quickly once 
the victim enters their login credentials and OTP on 
the phishing web page due to the short lifespan of 
one\-time authentication passwords.MFA fatigue 
is a threatAs MFA has gained increased importance, 
particularly in passwordless sign\-in, attackers have 
adaptedtrying to circumvent security protections 
by sending MFA or passwordless sign\-in prompts 
to potential victims. The aim is to trick them into 
accidentally approving requests through whats 
called MFA fatigue, or MFA bombing. Once the 
victim does so, the attacker gains full access to 
customers account and may modify the MFA 
settings, allowing them to sign in at any time.Cybersecurity attacks targeting MFA authentication 
and passwordless sign\-in are on the rise. 
Approximately 6,000 MFA fatigue attempts 
were observed per day by the end of June 2023\. 
In response, we have developed and implemented 
protections against anomalous passwordless sign\-in 
for all customers. We strongly advise customers to 
thoroughly review and validate MFApasswordless 
sign\-in prompts before approving them.Approximately 6,000 MFA 
fatigue attempts were 
observed per day.Actionable insightsDespite these risks, MFA remains an effective 
security measure. Here are some guidelines to 
enhance your security while using MFA: 1Use authenticator apps like Microsoft 
Authenticator instead of relying solely 
on text message codes.2Never share your security codeswith anyone.3Create strong and unique passwords 
using password generators and use a 
password manager.4Avoid reusing passwords acrossmultiple accounts.5Educate yourself and your employees 
about common social engineering 
tactics to recognize and avoid 
interactions with OTP bots. Microsoft Digital Defense Report 202336Token replay 
remains a 
prevalent threatWith this technique, attackers use tokens that were 
originally issued to legitimate users to authenticate 
and authorize privileges. The attackers acquire 
the tokens through means such as malware, 
phishing, or MFA fatigue to launch additional 
attacks. The number of token replay attacks has 
doubled since last year, with an average of 11 
detections per 100,000 active users in Azure Active

While technologies like Hello for Business and FIDO2 
hardware security keys offer phishing resistance, 
their widespread deployment across complex

MFA enablement 
on virtual private 
networksFor many years, VPNs have been used to enable 
secure remote access to company resources through 
encrypted tunnels. However, like any technology, 
ensuring compliance with an organizations 
security strategy requires proper configuration 
and alignment with a modern secure architecture, 
such as Zero Trust. Due to VPNs widespread use 
in corporate networks and their accessibility from 
the internet, they have become common targets 
for attacks, often due to misconfigurations, such as 
insufficient monitoring of user accounts and devices. 
In a typical corporate setup, users are assigned 
separate VPN accounts with restricted access to the 
internal network.Through our compromise recovery engagements, 
we found that almost half of VPN accounts lacked 
adequate MFA. Enabling MFA for these individual 
accounts is a crucial part of any VPN risk mitigation 
strategy. Other essential steps to secure these 
accounts include implementing conditional access, 
monitoring, and integrating security automation, if 
abuse of these accounts is detected.Almost half of VPN

 FY22 (July 2021\-June 2022\) 
 FY23 (July 2022\-June 2023\)Source: Microsoft Global DDoS Mitigation OperationsDDoS\-for\-hire servicesalso known 
as booters, stressers, or ddosersoffer 
subscriptions to botnets for varying 
lengths of time, allowing users to flood 
target internet resources with large 
amounts of data.This results in a denial of service. Since the attacks 
are launched from multiple networks, they are 
referred to as distributed denial of service attacks, 
or DDoS. These services can be purchased for as 
little as $5 USD and are increasingly being used as 
a cyberweapon in human operated ransomware 
attacks to exploit vulnerabilities in internet resources.These services pose a significant risk to 
cybersecurity, serving as a powerful tool for 
cybercriminals. In todays world, where we rely 
heavily on online services, DDoS attacks can render 
platforms such as business productivity and gaming 
inaccessible. Additionally, these attacks can be used 
in triple\-extortion human operated ransomware 
attacks to force victims to make payments,potentially leading to the destruction of confidential 
and proprietary business data hosted on servers.A notable achievement is the disruption by law 
enforcement of 48 DDoS\-for\-hire service platforms 
and legal action against six individuals involved.6 
Such intervention plays a vital role in mitigating 
the impact of DDoS attacks by targeting the 
infrastructure and individuals supporting these 
illicit services.The magnitude of the struggle is reflected in the 
fact that despite these achievements, the number 
of DDoS\-for\-hire platforms continues to rise, with 
20 percent having emerged in the past year alone. 
This alarming trend emphasizes the necessity for 
continuous monitoring, tracking, and decisive 
action against these platforms. The DCU has 
taken a proactive stance by actively tracking and 
monitoring 14 DDoS\-for\-hire sites, including one 
situated in the dark web, as part of its commitment 
to identifying potential threats and remaining ahead 
of cybercriminals.The number of DDoS\-for\-
hire platforms continues 
to rise, with 20 percent 
having emerged in the 
past year alone. Microsoft Digital Defense Report 202339Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeA new era of
cyberattacks: the 
rise of the botnets 
at scaleLast year marked a significant shift in 
cybercriminal tactics, with threat actors 
exploiting cloud computing resources 
such as virtual machines to launch 
DDoS attacks.To minimize costs, they targeted discounted Azure 
subscriptions across various regions, establishing 
and commandeering subscription accounts at every 
opportunity. From January 2023 onwards, we noted 
that compromised subscriptions were generating 
resources in up to 40 Azure regions monthly, 
demonstrating the global reach for malicious 
botnets holding potential for targeting assets and 
organizations. Among these, the US regions were 
the most exploited, constituting around 70 percent 
of the falsely spawned resources, while Europe 
followed at 15 percent.As the size of DDoS attacks increases, more and 
more cloud computing power is needed to absorb 
the leading wave of the attack until patterns can be 
identified, spurious traffic diverted, and legitimate 
traffic preserved. When hundreds of millions of 
requests per second originating from tens of 
thousands of devices constitute an attack, the cloud 
is our best defense, due to the scale needed to 
mitigate the largest attacks. In addition, due to the 
global distribution of the cloud, closer proximity 
helps to block attacks closest to the sources.The healthcare 
sector as a targetThis year, we observed an increase in daily DDoS 
attacks on the healthcare sector, particularly starting 
in January 2023\. While the overall attack throughput 
is not very high, at around 100,000 packets per 
second 99 percent of the time, there 
was a significant spike of 14 million packets per 
second at its peak, with the attack intensity reaching 
a peak of almost 100 attacks per day in June. KillNet, 
a group that the US Department of Health and 
Human Services has assessed to be pro\-Russia 
hacktivists, has been launching waves of DDoSattacks against western countries, including with 
a focus on the healthcare sector.The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency has collaborated with the FBI to develop 
guidance for DDoS response strategies to guide 
government agencies in protecting themselves 
against DDoS attacks.Additional informationKillNet and affiliate hacktivist groups targeting

preferred vectorTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
has become the dominant attack
vector, encompassing 59 percent 
of all DDoS attacks.This shift toward TCP stems from the escalated 
activities of some hacktivist groups, who are 
increasingly turning their sights on web applications, 
bolstered by the rising adoption of DDoS\-for\-hire 
tools. In comparison, last year User Datagram 
Protocol (UDP) amplification and UDP flood attacks 
occupied most of the attack spectrum, comprising 51 
percent of attacks while TCP was only 45 percent.The predominance of UDP\-led attacks in previous 
years, particularly targeting gaming applications, 
can be linked to the ripple effects of the COVID\-19 
pandemic. The enforced quarantines and lockdowns 
led to a surge in gamings popularity, rendering 
these services a lucrative target for attackers.Attacks increase in 
the United States 
and Europe, shifting 
away from IndiaUS entities have continued to be primary targets 
for DDoS attacks, bearing the brunt of 54 percent 
of all attacks. However, the past year has seen
Europe climb to the second highest with 14 percent 
of attacks, overtaking East Asia. The change is tied 
to geopolitical conflicts, with pro\-Russian hacktivist 
groups intensifying their onslaught against Europe 
and the United States. India, the second most

GFY22FY23Source: Microsoft Global DDoS Mitigation Operations Microsoft Digital Defense Report 202341Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeReturn on mitigation: 
Targeting investment 
to increase resilienceDuring Microsoft Incident Response 
engagements, customer environments 
have been found to lack mitigations 
that range from the simple to the 
more complex.While the goal of all mitigations is to make 
environments more resilient to cyberattacks, 
customers may not always have the resources 
to implement all of them, and a return on 
mitigation framework is helpful for prioritization.
Generally speaking, the lower the resources 
and effort involved, the higher the return on 
mitigation (ROM). As an example of a high return, 
consider a simple solution to implement context\-
based MFA protection. This solution is highly 
effective in preventing initial access (high security 
value) but very simple to implement (low effort). 
Whenimplemented,thissolutioneffectivelyprevents 
initial access by providing more context around the 
authentication attempt, such as geographic location 
and the application used. The additional context 
can be combined with requiring the user to enter 
a number (number matching) to complete MFA to 
further improve sign\-in security.Return on Mitigation scoring methodology

effort involved in implementing the solution. The higher the ROM score, the lower the resources and effort 
involved in implementing the solution for the impact and value provided.The percentage of environments missing each of the mitigations across all the environments reviewed 
during incident response engagements is also included.

A customer used the same local administrator 
password for all Windows endpoints. When an 
attacker gained access to one endpoint, they 
were able to move laterally and gain 
administrative privileges on all endpoints 
because of the shared password. This led to 
privilege escalation within the Active Directory
Domain Services (ADDS) domain and a total 
domain compromise. To prevent this type of 
lateral movement, the customer could have used 
a solution called Local Administrator Password 
Solution (LAPS) to randomize local administrator 
passwords across all endpoints. By doing so, 
the impact could have been contained to just 
one endpoint, and with other mitigations for 
privilege escalation, a total domain compromise 
could have been averted.Chapter 2 The State of CybercrimeRecommendationsThe most prevalent gaps we found during reactive 
incident response engagements were:Lack of adequate protection for localadministrative accounts.A broken security barrier between on\-premisesand cloud administration.Lack of adherence to the least privilege model.Legacy authentication protocols.Insecure Active Directory configurations.These gaps enable attacker tactics ranging from 
Initial Access to Lateral Movement and Persistence. 
To mitigate and protect against these tactics, we 
recommend randomizing local administrative 
account passwords, not synchronizing on\-
premises administrative accounts to the cloud,
and having separate accounts and purpose\-built 
hardened workstations for on\-premises and 
cloud administration.For more information about return on mitigation 
by techniques observed, please see page 43\.We also recommend using just\-in\-time and just\-
enough administration in the cloud and on premises, 
separating daily use and administrative accounts, 
making an inventory of all applications using legacy 
authentication protocols, and modernizing those 
applications where possible and phasing out those 
that cannot be modernized.

Based on the most prevalent gaps found during our reactive incident response engagements, 
here is a summary of actionable steps to take for greater cyber resiliency:ProblemInsecure configuration of identity platformMisconfigurations and exposure of identity platforms and their components are common vectors for attackers 
to gain unauthorized high\-privilege access.Insufficient privilege access and lateral movement controlsAdministrators have excessive permissions across the digital environment and often expose administrative 
credentials on workstations subject to internet and productivity risks.Low maturity security operationsMost impacted organizations used traditional threat detection tools and did not have relevant insights for 
timely response and remediation.Limited adoption of modern security frameworksIdentity is now the security perimeter, granting access to various digital services and computing environments. 
By integrating Zero Trust principles, application security, and other modern cyber frameworks, organizations 
can proactively manage risks that may be difficult to anticipate.No multifactor authentication (MFA) or lack of modern MFA mechanismsTodays attackers do not break in; they log in.Lack of information protection controlOrganizations struggle to implement comprehensive information protection controls that cover all data 
locations, remain effective throughout the information lifecycle, and align with the criticality of business data.Additional informationWindows LAPS overview \| Microsoft LearnActionable stepsAdhere to security configuration baselines and best practices when deploying and maintaining identity 
systems, such as Active Directory (AD) and Azure AD infrastructure. Enforce access restrictions by 
implementing segregation of privileges and least privilege access and utilize privileged access workstations 
(PAWs) to manage identity systems.To enhance resilience and limit the scope of an attack, secure and restrict administrative access. 
Utilize Privileged Access Management controls, such as just\-in\-time access and just\-enough administration. 
Avoid synchronizing on\-premises administrative accounts with the cloud and vice versa.A comprehensive threat detection strategy requires investments in extended detection and response (XDR) 
and modern cloud native tools employing machine learning to separate noise from signals. Modernize security 
operations tools by incorporating XDR that can provide deep security insights across the digital landscape.Zero Trust frameworks enforce concepts of least privilege, explicit verification of all access, and always assume 
compromise. Organizations should also implement security controls and practices in DevOps and application 
lifecycle processes for higher assurance levels in their business systems.MFA is a critical and fundamental user access control that all organizations should enable. Coupled with 
conditional access and modern MFA mechanisms, MFA can be invaluable in fighting cyber threats.Identify your critical business data and where it is located. Review information lifecycle processes and enforce 
data protection while ensuring business continuity.45Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 3 Nation State ThreatsChapter 3

increased investment and use of cyber 
operations as a tool to achieve their 
geopolitical goals. This is driving many 
organizations to invest in layered security 
to defend against sophisticated threats. 
It is also bringing the technology industry 
and governments together to increase 
resilience against attempts to undermine 
the security of the online environment.Cyberattacks continue to rise in sophistication and 
frequency. As the threat landscape evolves, we are 
seeing a blurring of lines between cyber operations, 
espionage, influence campaigns, and destructive 
attacks. Cyber operations have also become more 
public, often gaining more media attention, with the 
ongoing use of influence narratives to manipulate 
global and national opinion.We have seen a broader number of threat actors, 
both nation\-state and criminal, exploit newly 
released vulnerabilities more quickly, enhance 
their operations in cloud environments, and 
continue to use techniques to live off the land 
and evade detection. Looking to destructive cyber 
operations, the pace of Russian state\-sponsored 
destructive cyberattacks declined while the variety 
of attacks increased.As the threat landscape 
evolves, we are seeing 
a blurring of lines 
between cyber operations, 
espionage, influence 
campaigns, and 
destructive attacks.Organizations can reduce and prevent vulnerability 
exploits and compromised user credentials by 
continuing to harden the attack surface. We must 
also continue to combine cyber threat intelligence, 
geopolitical intelligence, and technical research to 
understand the whole adversary, achieve a more 
complete picture of the ever\-changing threat 
landscape, and improve collective resilience.John Lambert 
Corporate Vice President, Distinguished Engineer, 
Microsoft Security ResearchWe detected limited destructive attacks leveraging 
rudimentary file wipers through Summer 2023 and 
some isolated ransomware\-style attacks in late 
1\. By contrast, North Korean cyber operations 
increased in sophistication over the past year, with 
Citrine Sleet being the first activity group Microsoft 
observed capitalizing on a prior supply chain 
compromise to conduct the 3CX supply chain attack 
in March 2023\.We saw a China\-based actor which Microsoft 
is tracking as Storm\-0558 gain access to email 
accounts affecting approximately 25 organizations 
using forged authentication tokens to access user 
email using an acquired inactive Microsoft account 
(MSA) consumer signing key. Microsoft mitigated 
this attack for all customers. Iranian state actors 
conducted a GoldenSAML attack, a technique which 
was previously used by the highly sophisticated 
Russian group Midnight Blizzard.OpCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 124The rising complexity, scale, and volume of threats 
is driving the need to reimagine how we talk about 
threats and enable customers to understand threats 
quickly and with clarity. This year, we shifted to a 
new naming taxonomy for threat actors aligned with 
the theme of weather. The new taxonomy will bring 
better clarity to customers and security researchers 
with a more organized and easy to use reference 
system for threat actors.48Navigating evolving threats continuedEspionage operations increase and 
destructive operations declineNation\-state and state\-affiliated threat actor 
activities in the past year pivoted away from high\-
volume destructive attacks in favor of espionage 
campaigns. While the impact of destructive attacks 
is felt more immediately, persistent and stealthy 
espionage operations pose a long\-term threat to the 
integrity of government, private industry, and critical 
sector networks.Russian and Iranian state\-sponsored actors that 
employed destructive attacks most frequently, 
changed the frequency of their destructive 
operations over the past year. At the same time, 
threat actors globally acted to increase their 
collection capacity against foreign and defense 
policy organizations, technology firms, and critical 
infrastructure organizations.The high\-volume of destructive attacks that 
dominated the early stages of Russias invasion of 
Ukraine tapered off. Nearly 50 percent of destructive 
Russian attacks we observed against Ukrainian 
networks occurred in the first six weeks of the war.Please see About this Report on page 9 
for relevant definitions used in this chapter.50%of destructive Russian attacks we 
observed against Ukrainian networks occurred 
in the first six weeks of the war.Later, in October and November 2022, Russian 
state actor Seashell Blizzard added destructive 
ransomware to its toolkit, deploying Prestige 
ransomware against a Polish entity, and Prestige 
and Sullivan ransomware against Ukrainian 
organizations.1 The actor demonstrated consistent 
testing and development of the Sullivan payload, 
but Microsoft has not observed subsequent 
ransomware\-style attacks from this threat actor.2What Microsoft observed most often from Seashell 
Blizzard and other Russia\-affiliate threat actors 
were phishing and password spray campaigns, 
credential theft, lateral movement through networks, 
data exfiltration, and other actions associated 
with gaining and retaining access to targets for 
intelligence collection.For more about Russian state actors activity,

were the most targeted countries.HighestLowestIsraelMicrosoft Threat Intelligence observed state\-sponsored cyber threat activity against organizations in 
more than 120 countries and territories this year. Data destruction represented a small fraction of the 
observed activity, which was predominantly reconnaissance, initial access and various other actions on 
network, and data exfiltration. Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 3 Nation State Threats49Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Navigating evolving threats continuedActors associated with the Iranian government have 
also conducted fewer destructive cyberattacks. 
Groups like Cotton Sandstorm adopted a new tactic 
of cyber\-enabled influence operations (see page 68\), 
often using less time\- and resource\-intensive 
disruptive defacements and DDoS attacks. Since June 
2022, we have observed an increased pace in Irans 
use of these types of influence operations, focused 
on manipulative messaging and amplification with 
an underlying influence narrative.3 The rise of these 
operations corresponded with a decline in what was 
previously a spike in Iranian destructive cyberattacks 
using ransomware as a guise from 2020 to mid\-2022\.Critical infrastructure targeting remains robust 
across the board, increasing again in the last year, 
with threat actors employing stealthier techniques 
to establish persistence and evade detection in 
these sensitive networks.Volt Typhoon, a Chinese state\-affiliated actor, has 
targeted critical infrastructure organizations in Guam 
and elsewhere in the United States. Active since 
mid\-2021, the group conducted a campaign to 
infiltrate networks within US critical infrastructure41%of the threat notifications Microsoft sent to 
online services customers between July 2022 
and June 2023 went to critical infrastructure 
organizations.Chapter 3 Nation State ThreatsMost targeted sectors globallyState\-sponsored threat groups target broadly 
as part of their intelligence collection. 
Critical infrastructure sectors (highlighted) 
comprised 41% of the NSNs sent in FY2023\.LAorganizations including in the communications, 
utility, transportation, government, and information 
technology sectors.4 To evade detection, it used 
legitimate accounts, living\-off\-the\-land binaries, 
and SOHO routers for network communications. 
Meanwhile, Russian state actor Forest Blizzard 
exploited a zero\-day vulnerability in Outlook to steal 
data from defense industrial base and transportation 
sector organizations within NATO member states.5Diamond Sleet, a North Korean threat actor known 
for its destructive attack targeting Sony Pictures in 
2014, was observed targeting and compromising

influence operationsNation state actors are more frequently employing 
influence operations alongside cyber operations 
to spread favored propaganda narratives. 
Such narratives aim to manipulate global and 
national opinion and undermine the democratic 
institutions within perceived adversary nations. 
Influence operations which occur in the context 
of national elections or armed conflict are 
especially dangerous.In the online environment, cyber influence operations 
often make use of coordinated inauthentic behavior
such as the deployment of automated bots and 
web assets run by troll farms to generate, spread, 
and amplify content, often with false or misleading 
information. Offline, state actors undertake influence 
activity like staging provocations, traditional media 
engagement, and funding or supporting political 
groups or candidates. Such actionswhether 
online or offlinemay be done overtly, for example 
through state\-controlled media organs, or covertly. 
Often, they seek to exploit existing fault lines or 
divisions in societies to manipulate public opinion in 
support of a nations objectives.Although the tactics, techniques, and procedures 
(TTPs) employed in influence operations vary 
across campaigns, one noteworthy trend that has 
emerged across actors is the overlap and, in some 
cases, synchronization between traditional influence 
operations and cyber actions. In the wake of its 2022 
full\-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has consistently 
timed its influence activities to coincide with cyber 
and kinetic attacks. Similarly, Iran has intensified 
its use of cyber\-enabled influence operations to 
achieve greater impact. In July and September 
2022, Iranian state actors that we assess are linked 
to Irans Ministry of Intelligence and Security, 
conducted destructive attacks against the Albanian 
government.7 The attacks were followed by a 
coordinated influence operation by a cyber persona 
called Homeland Justice that has lasted up until the 
time of this writing. Homeland Justices narratives 
aligned with the messaging in the cyberattacks, 
calling on Albania to stop harboring members of the 
Mujahedin\-e Khalq, an Iranian dissident group that 
seeks the overthrow of the Iranian government.Finally, some influence actors have increasingly 
employed AI\-generated content in their influence 
operations targeting democracies.While AI\-generated profile pictures have long been 
a feature of state\-sponsored influence operations, 
the use of more sophisticated AI tools to create 
more striking multimedia content is a trend we 
expect to persist with the wider availability of 
such technologies.For more about influence operations,

Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed an uptick in 
Forest Blizzards use of it over a two\-week period, 
indicating the actors increasing high\-risk tolerance

its operations.9Separately, Forest Blizzard exploited Exchange Web 
Services in cloud and hybrid environments to steal 
data from email accounts at energy, defense, and 
air transportation organizations based in countries 
that provide logistics or tactical support to Ukraine. 
Employing advanced post\-compromise techniques, 
the actors positioned themselves to access any 
account of interest in a targeted environment. 
They used Exchange PowerShell to obtain 
persistent access to targeted mail items of interest 
by modifying folder permissions for a mailbox.

Russias war in Ukraine, as the dates between the 
attacks and public leaks have condensed from 
a few days to nearly same\-day operations.Microsoft has observed instances of convergence 
between Russia\-affiliated cyber operations and pro\-
Russian hacktivist attacks in Ukraine that probably 
serve to obscure Russian state involvement. 
Seashell Blizzard, Cadet Blizzard, and other 
suspected Russian actors all conducted operations 
that at times shared victimology and close temporal 
proximity with hacktivist groups that leaked 
sensitive stolen data or claimed to have conducted 
cyberattacks against named organizations.10Cyber\-

campaigns continue to try to sow distrust between 
Ukrainian populations and European partners who

campaigns targeting populations outside of Ukraine 
involved a series of operations showing similar 
TTPs as those used by Storm\-0257 (a threat group 
Microsoft assesses as most similar to Ghostwriter 
and UNC1151\). The campaign appeared aimed at 
diminishing trust between the Ukrainian diaspora 
and refugees, Polish, Lithuanian, and Latvian 
populations, and their governments.The campaign, which was first observed around mid\-
January 2023, leveraged email dissemination and 
inauthentic documents to spread a narrative that 
government officials may seek forced repatriation 
of Ukrainians or conscript European citizens for 
the war in Ukraine. Populations in NATO member 
states Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania were the 
primary targets.Microsofts investigation uncovered that one of the 
documents distributed via email was also tied to 
a physical flyer posted in Poland, demonstrating 
that the campaign bridged the digital and physical

Dziennik Polityczny, Belarusian state television,

Lithuanian citizens on social media served to further 
amplify the messages.Dissemination tactics in PolandReal world and digital campaigns converged on Poland, where fliers with a QR code

tactic to exert influence and a desired result of 
influence operations.Russian state\-sponsored influence actors, 
organizations, and outlets have helped amplify, 
support, and even organize pro\-Russian, antiwar 
protests across Europe. For example, Russias ruling 
party, United Russia, has nurtured ties with figures 
and groups within Italys pro\-Russia, anti\-Ukraine 
war movement,11 while the Kremlin has tried to 
influence and steer protests in Germany and forge 
an antiwar political coalition.12Pro\-Russian influence operators have specifically 
aimed to disrupt Western military support to Ukraine 
by encouraging European citizens to demonstrate 
against military assistance.We assess with moderate confidence that a protest 
initiative out of Western Europe called Stop 
Killing Donbass is a continuation of an earlier 
protest initiative known as the Map of Truth. Both 
initiatives tried to convince Europeans that Western 
military aid to Ukraine helps Kyiv kill innocent 
noncombatants, particularly children, and the two 
share striking similarities in TTPs, intended audience, 
involved individuals, and connections to a cluster of 
obscure websites.Russian state\-sponsored

used to engage audiencesAlthough Chinese\-affiliated actors have long relied 
on mass\-volume, they are becoming increasingly 
effective at engaging target audiences using 
evolving techniques. In the lead up to the 2022 US 
mid\-term elections, Microsoft and industry partners 
detected CCP\-affiliated social media accounts 
impersonating US votersan unprecedented 
move in CCP influence operations tactics.18These accounts pretended to be politically 
conservative or liberal Americans and actively 
interacted with target audiences by responding 
to comments made by likely authentic users.Part of an image shared by Chinese\-affiliated 
actors that bears signs of AI generation, 
including distorted faces and fingers.As part of a broad campaign focused on politically 
divisive topics in the United States, we have 
observed Chinese\-affiliated actors leveraging AI\-
generated visual media, most likely produced by 
diffusion\-powered image generators. While we 
have previously seen comics, digital drawings, 
collages, and stock photos being used, AI\-generated 
images have been more successful in driving 
audience engagement. Audiences frequently 
repost these visuals despite common indicators 
of AI\-generationfor example, more than five 
fingers on a persons hand.In a separate campaign, the CCP has poured 
resources into state\-backed multilingual internet 
celebrity studios ( ) in recent 
years.19 Comprising over 230 state media employees 
who masquerade as social media influencers, this 
effort leverages the power of authentic voices and 
video content.Recruited, trained, promoted, and funded by China

outfits, influencers spread localized CCP talking

taxonomy: SandstormSome Iranian state actors have enhanced 
their offensive cyber capabilities, while 
others combine low sophistication 
attacks with multi\-pronged influence 
operations for greater geopolitical effect. 
Iranian cyber and influence operations 
have turned firmly against the West and 
what it perceives as efforts by Western 
powers to foment unrest inside Iran. 
At the same time, Tehran has continued 
its pivot towards the East, including in 
the coordination of influence operations 
with Russia.For more information on threat actor

cyber capabilitiesIranian state actors used increasingly sophisticated 
tradecraft, enhancing operations in cloud 
environments, rolling out an increasing number of 
custom implants, and becoming faster at exploiting 
newly released vulnerabilities.Migrating components of targeting and 
operations to the cloud 
We have observed multiple Iranian state actors 
migrating components of their targeting and 
operations to the cloud.In February, destructive operations enabledby Mango Sandstorm, a group linked to Irans 
Ministry of Intelligence and Security, impacted 
both on\-premises and cloud environments. 
Prior to the attack, Iranian state actors moved 
laterally from an on\-premises to a cloud 
environment by manipulating the Azure 
Active Directory Connect agent using stolen 
credentials of highly privileged accounts.21In March, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
(IRGC)\-linked Peach Sandstorm conducted a 
GoldenSAML attack to leverage a compromise 
of an on\-premises network to pivot to the 
victims cloud environment to exfiltrate data.In separate intrusions early in 2023, PeachSandstorm maintained persistence using Azure 
Arca platform that allows users to manage 
resources deployed both within and outside of 
Azure through the same control plane.The TTPs observed in Peach Sandstormsintrusions represent a significant increase in 
the maturity of its capabilities, growth that is 
especially notable following a two\-year period 
during which we observed very little activity 
linked to these operators.Regular use of custom tooling 
We observed Iranian state actors regularly using 
custom tools in their operations. These tools 
provided capabilities in establishing persistence,evading detection, and credential theft. The use 
of previously unseen malware helps threat actors 
stay a step ahead of defenders, requiring defenders 
to identify new tools, develop and deploy 
corresponding signatures or detections, and keep 
pace with actors evolving arsenal of options.Between late 2022 and June 2023, we observed 
Mint Sandstorm using MischiefTut, a custom 
backdoor implemented in PowerShell with a 
set of basic capabilities.23 MischiefTut can run 
reconnaissance commands, write outputs to 
a text file, and download additional tools on a 
compromised system.GoldenSAML attack chain 
In a golden SAML attack, an adversary will steal private keys from a targets on\-premises Active Directory 
Federated Services (ADFS) server to mint a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) token trusted by 
a targets Office 365 environment.22On\-Prem AD

EnvironmentIn early 2023, Mango Sandstorm sent phishing 
emails to employees of telecommunications 
and government organizations in, or with ties 
to, countries in the Middle East. The group 
used remote monitoring and management 
tools to retain access to compromised 
environments. In at least one case, they used 
a custom credential stealer to siphon users 
credentials.In June, Pumpkin Sandstorm used thecustom dropper BellaCiao to deliver tools to 
organizations. Because BellaCiao can be used 
to deliver various tools, post\-compromise 
activity varies based on the operators 
decisions. In at least one intrusion, we observed 
operators stealing credentials from an infected 
system. We assess that known BellaCiao 
samples have been specifically configured 
to target specific organizations located in 
Afghanistan, Austria, Azerbaijan, Canada, 
Egypt, France, Greece, India, Italy, Lebanon, 
the Philippines, and the United Kingdom.SAML signing key is stolen to mint

We increasingly observed a subgroup of an 
Iranian state actor, Mint Sandstorm, rapidly 
weaponizing N\-day vulnerabilities in common 
enterprise applications.24 An N\-day vulnerability 
is a flaw in software for which an official patch or 
security update has been released. Until 2023, 
this subgroupwhich we assess is linked to the 
intelligence arm of the IRGCwas slow to adopt 
exploits for recently\-disclosed vulnerabilities 
with publicly reported proof of concept (POC) 
code, often taking several weeks to successfully 
weaponize exploits for vulnerabilities like Proxyshell 
and Log4Shell. Beginning this year, we observed a 
notable decrease in the time it took to adopt and 
incorporate public POCs. Mint Sandstorm operators 
exploited vulnerabilities in applications such as 
Zoho ManageEngine, Aspera Faspex, and Adobe 
ColdFusion within days of their initial disclosure.Additional information

cyber\-enabled
influence operationsWhile some Iranian state actors were honing the 
sophistication of their tradecraft on network, 
other state\-sponsored groups supplemented basic 
cyberattacks with a new playbook: leveraging cyber\-
enabled influence operations to fuel geopolitical 
change in alignment with Tehrans objectives.In the second half of 2022, Iranian groups increased 
the pace of operations in which they amplify 
low sophistication cyberattacks with multi\-pronged 
influence operations. Iranian groups use of a 
repeatable playbook and low\-effort cyberattacks 
requiring little to no access to a victim network\-
enabled them to quickly replicate their operations, 
shifting from one victim to the next.Irans cyber\-enabled influence operations have 
pushed narratives that seek to bolster Palestinian 
resistance, sow panic among Israeli citizens, foment 
Shiite unrest in Gulf Arab countries, and counter the 
normalization of Arab\-Israeli ties.While specific narratives varied, the underlying goal 
was often the same. Tehran likely sought to retaliate 
against what it perceived were efforts by foreign 
actors to foment unrest in Iran, including highly 
sophisticated cyberattacks in 2021 and 2022 by a 
group called Predatory Sparrow against Irans steel 
factories, state broadcasts, gas stations, and trains.25 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 3 Nation State Threats68Iran continuedFirmly turning 
against the WestWhile Irans most common targetsthe United 
States and Israelremain at the top of its list, Iran 
has broadened its targeting of the West, particularly 
its cyber\-enabled influence operations to target 
European NATO member states.In France, a cyber persona calling itself Holy Souls, 
assessed to be linked to Iranian state actor Cotton 
Sandstorm, targeted French satirical magazine 
Charlie Hebdo in January.26Targeting journalists 
and political activistsIn the weeks after the outbreak of protests in 2022, 
Mint Sandstorm sent protest\-themed emails to 
individuals and groups the actor likely perceived 
were linked or sympathetic to protests. Previously, 
since mid\-2021, Mint Sandstorm has targeted 
Iranian expatriate human rights and womens 
rights activists, scholars, and journalists, often 
through spear\-phishing campaigns masquerading 
as researchers soliciting input or commentary on a 
recent geopolitical event or development.At the same time, since September 2022 Iran 
has also likely waged a cyber\-enabled influence 
campaign to target and harass prominent Iranian 
oppositionists who shed light on protests and 
sought to counter Irans state\-controlled attempts 
to manipulate the narrative and suppress protests. 
Iran likely sought to undercut the momentum of 
nationwide protests by leaking information intended 
to embarrass prominent regime opposition figures 
or to expose their corrupt relationships.The cyber\-enabled 
influence operations 
against Albania marked 
Irans first destructive 
attack directly targeting 
a NATO\-member 
government.It posted for sale on a leak site a trove of data 
reportedly containing the names and addresses 
of 230,000 Charlie Hebdo customers, likely in 
retaliation for Charlie Hebdo publishing cartoons 
that ridiculed Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.The previously mentioned cyber\-enabled influence 
operations against Albania27 marked Irans first 
destructive attack directly targeting a NATO\-
member government. The persona has continued 
to leak tranches of emails from several high\-profile 
Albanian government organizations, including the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May.Following the outbreak of nationwide anti\-
government protests in Iran in September 2022, 
Tehran likely directed its security services to work 
against the same Iranian expatriates that Iranian 
state cyber actors set their sights on following the 
election of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi in 2021\. A cyber persona we assess operates on Irans behalf, 
Adll Ali ( 
), began its first influence campaign 
seeking to counter the narrative surrounding 
Mahsa Aminis death, which sparked nationwide 
protests. It attempted to pin the blame on the 
Komala Party, an Iranian Kurdish separatist group 
that Iran considers a terrorist group, through 
documents it claimed to have acquired from a cyber 
operation against the group. Adll Ali later sought 
to expose hypocritical or salacious activities of 
Iranian opposition figures. For example, it leaked 
embarrassing videos and pictures of Reza Pahlavi, 
the eldest son of Irans former monarch, and 
his family. Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 3 Nation State Threats69Iran continuedPivoting towards 
the EastIranian and Russian state media outlets have a 
history of cooperation, including multiple formal 
memorandums of understanding and media 
cooperation agreements. Coordination between 
Iranian and Russian state media increased after 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leading to a 
convergence of narratives relating to the invasion 
and Iranian protest movements in 2022\.In October 2022, a leak of thousands of emails 
from Irans English\-language news outlet, PressTV,28 
revealed Iranian state media executives travel to 
Moscow in 2019 to establish media cooperation 
agreements. It also revealed correspondence 
between Russian and Iranian state media officials 
to coordinate messaging in September 2020, and 
sharing of content and correspondents since at 
least 2020\.These agreements enable the two countries 
to support each other on controversial issues. 
For example, while Iran has declared its neutrality 
regarding the conflict in Ukraine, Iranian state media 
has largely defended Russias position, including 
the verbatim use of Russian disinformation such 
as accusations of the United States establishing 
offensive biolabs in Ukraine. Additionally, PressTV 
has embedded a reporter with Russian troops in 
the Russian\-occupied Donetsk region of Ukraine. 
Multiple Iranian Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting 
media officials contribute to Russian state media, 
including Sputniks Persian language website.Coordination between 
Iranian and Russian 
state media increased
after the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine.Outsourcing influence operations 
to engage international audiencesSabereen News, which posts primarily on Telegram 
to an Iraqi audience, is another Iran\-backed outlet 
run from abroad. The outlet is run by Iraqs Iran\-
backed PMUs and was reportedly created by 
Irans Islamic Radios and Televisions Unionthe 
propaganda arm of Irans IRGC Quds Force. 
The outlet largely focuses on local Iraqi issues but 
has also promoted Russian propaganda and has 
claimed to conduct cyber operations against foreign 
and domestic targets.Iran has increasingly outsourced influence 
operations to proxy outlets and journalists who 
present themselves as independent. In addition to 
operating numerous state\-run outlets targeting 
foreign audiences in English, Arabic, and other 
languages, Tehran heavily supports pro\-Iranian 
media outlets abroad that can more easily connect 
to international audiences.Iran also uses its militant proxy and partner 
organizations like Hezbollah in Lebanon and 
the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Units (PMUs) to 
disseminate Iran\-aligned propaganda via their 
affiliated outlets. For example, Al\-Mayadeen, a 
popular Lebanon\-based multilingual news outlet, 
claims to be funded by independent businessmen; 
however, the outlet maintains close leadership and 
business ties to Iranian and Hezbollah figures. Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 3 Nation State Threats70North KoreaThreat actor naming

cryptocurrency 
theft and supply 
chain attacksNorth Korean actors continued to steal 
cryptocurrency with greater sophistication, and 
conducted the first supply chain attack Microsoft 
has observed among these groups. In January 2023, 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) publicly 
attributed the June 2022 heist of $100 million in 
cryptocurrency from Harmonys Horizon Bridge to 
North Korean cyber actors. Microsoft attributed this 
activity to Jade Sleet, which we estimate has stolen 
approximately $1 billion in cryptocurrency so far.31 
As mentioned earlier in the chapter (see page 47\), 
Microsoft attributed the March 2023 3CX supply 
chain attackwhich leveraged a prior supply chain 
compromise of a US\-based financial technology 
company in 2022to Citrine Sleet. This was the 
first time we have observed an activity group using 
an existing supply chain compromise to conduct 
another supply chain attack.32Weaponizing open\-

by cyber mercenaries 
150\+Cyberspace is an increasingly contested 
area for conflict and strategic rivalries 
among states. However, the development 
and maintenance of offensive cyber 
capabilities is costly and labor\-intensive, 
demanding skills many countries lack 
or cannot maintain.This has led to the emergence of cyber mercenaries 
or private sector offensive actorscommercial 
actors that are knownlegitimate legal entities that 
create and sell cyberweapons to customers, often 
but not always governments, who select targets 
and operate the cyberweapons.While the employment of cyber mercenaries may seem 
attractive to some countries as a means of adding to 
their arsenal, the unchecked expansion of the mercenary 
marketplace threatens to severely destabilize the 
broader online environment. The Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace has identified at least 74 
governments that have contracted firms to gain spyware 
and digital forensics technology.38 The explosive growth 
of this market poses a real threat to democracy and the 
overall stability and security of the online environment.companies partnering to collectively push back 
on the cyber mercenary marketMicrosoft tracks cyber mercenary actors located all 
over the globe. An important goal in Microsoft publicly 
discussing our research is to have a material impact on 
the cyber mercenary landscape, and there have been 
several notable recent developments. We publicly 
identified a threat actor we refer to as Carmine 
Tsunami and which we believe was an Israeli company, 
QuaDream. Together with security researchers from 
CitizenLab, we tracked the software suite it sold that 
consisted of exploits, malware, and infrastructure 
designed to exfiltrate data from mobile devices. 
CitizenLab identified at least five civil society victims, 
including journalists, political opposition figures, and a 
non\-government organization (NGO) worker, in North 
America, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and 
the Middle East.39 Furthermore, it was able to identify 
operator locations for QuaDream systems around the 
world, including: Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Ghana, 
Israel, Mexico, Romania, Singapore, the United ArabEmirates, and Uzbekistan. As a result of Microsoft 
and Citizen Labs reports, QuaDream shut down and 
stopped its operations in 2023\. DSIRF, an Austrian 
cyber mercenary tracked by Microsoft as Denim 
Tsunami, has also recently shut down.We believe it is critical to work with others to address 
this emerging threat. Others in the technology 
industry have seen additional actors, employed by 
these and other governments, try to undermine the 
security of the online environment. This is why we 
have partnered with the over 150 companies that 
make up the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, as well as 
Google and Apple, to collectively push back on the 
cyber mercenary market by committing to a set of 
industry principles40 aimed at limiting the threats 
posed by these groups (see page 124\).As the technology industry builds and maintains 
the majority of what we consider cyberspace, 
we as an industry have a responsibility to curb the 
harm caused by cyber mercenaries. At a high level, 
signatories commit to:Take steps to counter cyber mercenaries use ofproducts and services to harm people.

security strategiesIntroduction from Michal Braverman\-BlumenstykAs we navigate the ever\-changing landscape of cybersecurity threats, it is 
clear that a new approach to defense is imperative for ensuring resilience.Gone are the days when organizations can rely 
on isolated efforts at defense within their own 
environments. Todays attacks on the intersection 
of information technology and operational 
technology (IT\-OT) emphasize the importance of 
a comprehensive defense strategy that covers the 
entire business ecosystem.To achieve this, organizations must ensure 
interoperability between their IT and OT security 
systems, connecting telemetry and insights from 
all areas of the business to gain a comprehensive 
security view. A holistic security strategy is crucial to 
safeguard against threats to the internet of things 
(IoT), supply chains, and critical infrastructure. 
In the quest for a stronger defense, AI can be a 
valuable co\-pilotparticularly in areas requiring 
specialized expertise like IoTOT security. AI can 
bridge knowledge and resource gaps, significantly 
enhancing an organizations security posture and 
enabling it to effectively thwart attacks.The stakes are high when it comes to critical 
infrastructure. In recent years, threats targeting 
these networks have increased, as have their far\-
reaching consequences, which include disruptive 
events, financial losses, and even danger to human 
lives. Defending against these attacks presents a 
complex challenge due to the intricate nature of 
OT networks, which often consist of legacy systems 
and encompasses diverse protocols, devices, and 
architectures, making them inherently challenging to 
secure and monitor effectively.Past attacks on critical infrastructure were 
predominantly attributed to nation\-state actors, 
given the complexity involved and limited commercial 
knowledge in this domain. However, we are seeing a 
notable shift as the accessibility of OT test beds and 
protocols lowers the entry barrier for malicious actors, 
resulting in an increase in off\-the\-shelf malware 
targeting IoTOT devices. This has effectively opened 
the door for new threats to critical infrastructure.The increasing interconnectivity between IoTOT 
networks, critical infrastructure, and the outside 
world is fueled by digital transformation trends and 
the potential advantages they offer to businesses. 
However, this trend, coupled with the absence of 
secure design principles and device security in 
current OT networks, as well as the lack of robust 
supply chain security in some supply chains (which 
may involve the use of open\-source and insecure 
components), presents significant risks to businesses.Despite the challenges, organizations are improving 
their cybersecurity by investing in advanced 
technologies like AI and machine learning to augment 
their security teams. Theyre also collaborating with 
industry partners to share information and raise 
awareness of emerging threats. By working together 
and taking a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, 
organizations can better safeguard their operations 
and ensure resilience against evolving threats.Michal Braverman\-Blumenstyk

hackers. Patching these systems can be 
challenging for organizations, as updates 
may need to be postponed to avoid 
disrupting operations.Additionally, some OT devices lack patches for 
vulnerabilities, often due to discontinued support. 
Hackers can exploit vulnerable OT devices by using 
internet search tools to find ports used for remote

deployment leaves 
systems vulnerableBalancing robust cyber hygiene with 
uninterrupted operations in industrial 
and critical infrastructure environments is 
complex. One of the key challenges lies in 
effectively managing timely patch updates 
while maintaining peak system performance. 
This delicate equilibrium demands 
careful consideration, as overlooking the 
importance of cyber hygiene can leave 
vital systems vulnerable to malicious actors 
seeking to exploit weaknesses.To examine how this balance is managed across a 
variety of programmable logic controllers (PLCs), 
we started by using Defender for IoTs on\-premises 
network sensors to identify OT assets on a network, 
including vendor, model, and firmware version. 
Our focus was on a collection of widely used PLCs 
within the Defender for IoT customer base to 
determine the distribution of firmware versions 
deployed on the devices. To investigate devicevulnerabilities, we partnered aDolus Technology, a 
supply chain security company that uses machine 
learning algorithms to analyze manufacturer and 
industry disclosures and identify CVEs (publicly disclosed 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities) present in firmware.2We found a significant lag between the availability of 
security fixes in firmware and their deployment onto 
the OT network. Although many of the PLC models 
showed a marked reduction in high confidence 
exploitable CVEs from older versions to the newest 
versions, over 60 percent of devices were still running 
older versions of the firmware with eight or more 
exploitable CVEs. If the latest version of the firmware 
available for these PLC models were to be deployed, 
the number of devices with no known exploitable 
CVEs would increase from four to 40 percent.There are valid reasons for the delay in some devices 
receiving patches. Unlike traditional IT devices with 
regular patch Tuesday updates, OT devices have 
years\-long patch cycles. It is not as simple as rebooting 
a PLC on the spot, especially when it manages a 
process that requires high availability. However, most 
facilities typically have annual or bi\-annual maintenance 
outage windows that will allow for patching.Deploying the latest firmware versions available for 
these PLC models could increase the percentage of 
devices with no known exploitable CVEs from4\-40%Chapter 4Critical Cybersecurity ChallengesOT common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs)More than 60 percent of devices are on firmware versions that expose the devices to eight or more

because only specific versions of firmware have 
the necessary certifications. As an example, SIL2 
Safety Certification can be legally required when 
a PLC is used to control a hazardous process, but 
not every firmware release for a given model has 
SIL2 certification.Considering these limitations, we looked at 
how long security patches have been available. 
Many were released years ago, including patched 
versions that were fully safety certified. A significant 
number of devices running vulnerable firmware 
have had patches available for more than eight 
years. Even with the unique constraints of the OT 
environment, these delays underscore the need 
for industry to decrease the time between security 
patch release and deployment.Actionable insights1

comprehensive OT patch management system 
cannot be overstated. While strides have been 
made to identify and address vulnerabilities 
within devices powering manufacturing lines 
and critical infrastructure, this is insufficient. 
Achieving true resilience necessitates the 
implementation of a holistic approach to OT risk 
management which encompasses asset visibility, 
patch levels, vulnerability monitoring, and the 
availability of updates.Though the prospect of interrupting essential 
processes or requiring recertification may 
be daunting, the potential consequences of 
leaving exploitable vulnerabilities unchecked 
pose a far greater risk, potentially jeopardizing 
lives and wreaking havoc on critical systems. 
Organizations must recognize the imperative 
nature of a robust OT patch management 
system as an essential component of their 
overall cybersecurity strategy.Chapter 4Critical Cybersecurity Challenges82 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023The state of IoT and OT security continuedDefending and 
strengthening air 
gapped networksAs organizations implement digital 
transformation programs, its crucial 
to monitor and discover inventory in 
networks that were previously thought 
to be air gapped.This is because air gaps are no longer enough to 
protect networks from malicious attacks, as attackers 
can use various methods to gain access. Therefore, 
organizations must extend their monitoring and 
inventory discovery beyond air\-gapped networks to 
ensure their networks are secure and up to date with 
the latest technologies and security protocols.Business critical systems consist of numerous assets, 
some of which are unknown or unmanaged by 
operations and security teams. With the increasing 
attack surface of networks, its essential for 
organizations to detect and manage these unknown 
and unmanaged assets. This helps ensure that 
networks remain secure and up to date, reducing 
the risk of malicious attacks. Asset profiling enables 
end\-to\-end discovery of assets by analyzing network 
signals to identify and categorize network assets, the 
information collected about them, and the types of 
assets they represent.A vast collection of classifiers allows for high\-fidelity 
categorization in the cloud, including servers, 
workstations, mobile devices, and embedded IoT 
OT devices.Properly classifying assets enables organizations 
to monitor and analyze potential security risks. 
Any vulnerability or misconfiguration in an asset can 
create an entry point for attackers, making it critical 
to protect an organizations networks.Chapter 4Critical Cybersecurity ChallengesIt is crucial to apply 
available patches as soon 
as available, and isolate 
IoT devices from networks 
with OT and ICS.The vulnerabilities in the Boa web server are well\-
known and documented, and academic training 
modules even teach individuals how to exploit them, 
lowering the barrier for a successful attack. However, 
many people are unaware that their devices use the 
outdated server or that the server is built into their 
network devices and shipped directly from vendors. 
Firmware updates and patches may not address 
the issue as the update may need to be issued by 
a chain of vendors that may not have visibility into 
its inclusion.83 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023The state of IoT and OT security continuedSupply chain 
risks posed by 
embedded softwareVulnerabilities can occur at any stage 
of a devices lifecycle, from design 
to distribution, and can have serious 
consequences for critical infrastructure. 
As organizations increasingly rely on 
devices to manage processes, streamline 
operations, and provide infrastructure, 
potentially insecure supply chains pose 
a significant risk.One of the biggest concerns with device supply 
chain risks is the use of third\-party components 
within the deployed software and hardware in 
OT and industrial control system (ICS) networks. 
These components may not be visible to 
organizations and can pose a significant threat 
to networks, particularly those that have not 
properly isolated devices according to best 
practice guidelines.Outdated software development kits (SDKs) and 
system\-on\-a\-chip (SoC) components in devices 
present a significant risk. SoCs are used to manage 
a variety of computational processes and are 
often operated by outdated SDKs that implement 
essential processes. These components can be 
hidden from network administrators and pose a 
serious threat to networks when left unpatched. 
Updating the firmware of IoT devices does not 
always fix vulnerabilities in these components, and 
it is often difficult to determine if they can even 
be updated.Boa web server highlights the risksIn November 2022, Microsoft researchers identified 
the Boa web server as a component on indicators 
of compromise in an attack on critical infrastructure. 
Despite being discontinued in 2005, it is still widely 
used in many IoT devices and popular SDKs. 
We found over one million internet\-exposed Boa 
web servers worldwide during our investigation. 
Our research revealed that 10 percent of similar 
incidents were related to critical industries, such 
as the petroleum industry and associated fleet 
services. Many of the IP addresses were associated 
with IoT devices that had additional unpatched 
critical vulnerabilities, making them an accessible 
attack vector for malware operators. Attackers can 
exploit vulnerabilities in the Boa web server to gain 
access to networks and collect sensitive information 
from files before moving laterally in the network or 
initiating additional attacks on a device.84 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023The state of IoT and OT security continuedCODESYS vulnerabilities affect hundreds 
of vendorsLast year, we reported on the Incontroller 
framework, a modular attack toolkit that can 
penetrate OT networks and attack devices. 
This highly customizable framework applies to 
popular PLC protocols, reducing the attackers 
research lead time to attack OT and critical 
infrastructure. The toolkit can issue commands to 
change configurations, manipulate outputs, implant 
backdoors, issue vulnerabilities, upload ladder logic, 
and initiate DoS attacks.500\+manufacturers supporting 
architectures spread across 
millions of devices worldwideOur research on the Incontroller framework 
found a module that could crash a specific 
vendors PLC. We also discovered 15 new zero\-
day vulnerabilities in the CODESYS runtime during 
our extensive CODESYS SDK research.3 CODESYS 
is a platform\-independent software framework 
used for programming PLCs, and its widespread 
use across various industries highlights significant 
risks associated with supply chain vulnerabilities 
in the OT industry. With over 500 manufacturers 
supporting architectures spread across millions of 
devices worldwide, the potential impact of these 
vulnerabilities is significant.OT networks often lack key security measures and 
are directly connected to the network, making 
them an easy target for attackers. This can lead to 
significant disruption of critical infrastructure, as 
even one disconnected component can impact 
manufacturing lines and operations managed by 
PLCs. A vulnerable version of CODESYS could enable 
threat actors to shut down operations of critical 
infrastructure through a denial\-of\-service attack. 
Remote code execution could create a backdoor 
for devices, allowing attackers to tamper with 
operations, cause a controller to run dangerously, 
or steal critical information.Chapter 4Critical Cybersecurity ChallengesActionable insightsAdditional informationMultiple high severity vulnerabilities in CODESYS

governments around the world 
are taking steps to improve the 
security and resilience of their 
critical infrastructure through 
laws and regulations.These actions have the potential to raise 
cyber defenses, but also increase the risk of 
overlapping or inconsistent requirements across 
different jurisdictions that increase complexity 
and costs and decrease security investments.Governments should seek to establish 
requirements that drive iterative learning and 
improvements and support global, cross\-sector 
interoperability. These requirements should 
maximize the ability to adopt cloud services to 
take advantage of their cybersecurity benefits.While each countrys approach to regulating 
critical infrastructure varies, we have noticed 
three main themes: 1Governments are raising the bar forcybersecurity in critical infrastructure entities 
and making sure executives and boards are 
aware of the importance of digital security 
and resilience. 2Governments are increasingly identifying 
cloud services as critical infrastructure. 3Regulators are implementing new incident

as early as six hours after an incident, an 
unrealistic timeframe which is inconsistent 
with global norms of between 24 and

Directive will enforce mandatory security 
requirements in mid\-2024 for wireless devices 
with the goals of improving network resilience, 
protecting consumers privacy, and reducing the 
risk of monetary fraud. Cybersecurity requirements 
in the Radio Equipment Directive are likely to 
be overshadowed by the proposed EU Cyber 
Resilience Act (CRA), anticipated to be finalized 
in 2024\. Microsoft believes the CRA could have 
serious implications for product cybersecurity, 
similar to how the EU General Data Protection 
Regulation promulgated privacy requirements. 
The CRA envisions mandatory essential 
cybersecurity requirements for nearly all connected 
products with digital elements to be sold in the 
European Union, including hardware, standalone 
software, and associated remote data processing. 
Requirements are structured to improve security 
throughout the lifecycle of products, including 
design, development, and support. The CRA 
includes conformity assessment and product 
security labeling through the application of the 
European CE marking system.90 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 4Critical Cybersecurity ChallengesInnovating for supply 
chain resilienceManaging supply 
chain risk at the 
speed of regulationSince 2020, software supply chain security attacks
such as Solarwinds, Log4j, Codecov and Kaseya 
have affected over 490 million known customers 
and exposed over 100,000 malicious open source 
packages. With an average yearly increase of 742 
percent in attacks since 2019, this number will only 
7 
continue to rise.Microsoft has taken proactive and collaborative 
measures such as supplier audits to address the top 
three supply chain threats: ransomware, phishing, 
and malware. By working together with suppliers 
and investing in education and awareness training, 
our goal is to prevent future attacks and ensure swift 
recovery in case of a breach.In collaboration with international partners, we 
are exploring the use of emerging technologies 
in AI to revolutionize the security landscape. For more about using modern AI to strengthen 
supply chain security see page 95\.We also work internationally to lobby for rules 
and norms that would prohibit nation states from 
engaging in indiscriminate supply chain attacks that 
put millions of customers at risk.Innovation for securing the software supply chain 
is crucial for keeping businesses and networks safe. 
Recent cybersecurity incidents highlight the software 
supply chains extensive attack surface, which includes 
source code, developer machines, source control 
systems, dependencies, build servers, and the release 
pipeline. As government mandates and industry 
regulations emerge to address these risks, software 
producers and engineers play a pivotal role in 
tackling the compliance challenge while maintaining 
their efficiency. Leveraging automation presents an 
opportunity to fulfill these obligations at a reduced 
cost and lower impact on engineers.EmPaCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesOpmapping index on page 124Microsofts 
secure\-by\-design 
supply chainCelebrating 20 years of the Security 
Development Lifecycle (SDL)We prioritize security in every aspect of our products 
and services to ensure resilience. The Microsoft Security 
Development Lifecycle (SDL), introduced in 2004, is 
designed to identify and minimize risks throughout 
the product lifecycle, meet compliance requirements, 
and deliver reliable solutions to our customers.8We have evolved the SDL to adapt to cloud 
computing, AIML advancements, the changing 
threat landscape, and regulatory demands like US 
Executive Order 14028 (Improving the Nations 
Cybersecurity). Our latest SDL updates focus on 
simplicity, automation, and providing developers 
with further guidance and guardrails.We leverage enforcement mechanisms within our 
development and cloud platforms to impose SDL 
requirements early in the development lifecycle. 
For example, we scan code for potential exposure 
of sensitive information before it is committed to 
version control and ensure that code is reviewed 
by someone other than the author before 
being committed.We also invest in finding vulnerable code across 
our products and services. CodeQL is a powerful 
static analysis tool which we use to identify security 
issues and potential vulnerabilities in programming 
languages. We centrally store source code snapshots 
generated at build time in CodeQL Central and 
run predefined rules or ad hoc queries against 
them. These rules help identify known vulnerable 
code patterns, capture evidence of secure coding 
practices, and highlight areas affected by emerging 
requirements like Post\-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).Our approach has significantly reduced the feedback 
loop when new vulnerabilities are discovered, 
providing actionable results to developers within 
hours. When these CodeQL rules mature or require 
urgent release, as in the case of Solorigate,9 we 
open\-source them and incorporate them into the 
CodeQL product to benefit all users.While automation plays a vital role, we also prioritize 
developer security training, threat modelling, 
and specialized reviews in areas like AIML and 
cryptography. These efforts provide knowledge 
which feeds back into our SDL guidance and 
automation, allowing us to scale while ensuring 
security. We also share knowledge externally 
through published guidance, open\-sourced tools, 
and new features in our developer and cloud 
platforms to foster a more collaborative and 
resilient environment for all.PrEmCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 12491 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Innovating for supply chain resilience continuedSecuring the development infrastructureWe built a threat model of our end\-to\-end DevOps 
environment in 2023 to identify potential threats and 
prioritize security investments to reduce risk within 
the engineering ecosystem. It includes the Continuous 
IntegrationContinuous Deployment (CICD) platform, 
developer identities, and all connected services used 
by our developers (such as Microsoft Dev Box and 
GitHub Codespaces). The model was informed by 
real\-world threat reports and calculated risk scores. 
Based on the results, we made several security 
investments: adopting secure boot for our build 
machines, improving inventory and update processes 
for build tools, and validating the integrity of our 
software bills of materials (SBOMs) at release time.Our security measures go beyond just identity, 
devices, and access. We follow Zero Trust principles 
to secure our developers. This includes using phish\-
resistant MFA, requiring managed healthy devices to 
access DevOps web apps, replacing personal access 
tokens (PAT) bearer tokens with managed identities, 
and applying the least privilege access principle to 
managing version control and build configuration. 
We also perform periodic user access reviews to 
ensure privileges are only granted to those with a 
business need and use just\-in\-time (JIT) permission 
controls for administration tasks.Additional informationEmbrace proactive security with Zero Trust\| MicrosoftManaged identities for Azure resources \| MicrosoftHow our SDL and development infrastructure security come together

To encourage collaboration, we have created an 
environment that allows developers to choose 
the best open source for their needs, without 
outdated pre\-approved lists or manual reviews.It is crucial to ensure we use open source safely 
and efficiently. We have invested in an internal 
tool that continuously inventories open source, 
flags license concerns, and alerts developers 
to vulnerabilities.This tool is available to customers on Azure 
DevOps through GitHub Advanced Security 
for Azure DevOps.10PrEmCybersecurity Tech Accord principles

materials (SBOMs), which provide software 
transparency to customers. SBOMs enable 
organizations to manage their supply chain 
risk for the software thats deployed across 
their enterprise.Since 2019, we have 
contributed to cross\-
industry working groups, 
international standards, and 
open\-source tools aiming to 
advance SBOM generation, 
sharing, and consumption.Our SBOM generation tool detects dependencies 
across numerous ecosystems and is available 
as open source. We generate SBOMs using 
the Linux Foundations Software Package 
Data eXchange (SPDX) 2\.x JSON format. 
Microsoft Defender for IoT firmware analysis 
allows customers to generate an SBOM and 
identify potential security vulnerabilities.NuGet plans to support SBOM generation natively 
within its ecosystem so that every future NuGet 
package would have an SBOM,11 and GitHub now 
allows exporting SBOMs from repositories.Organizations should prepare now for consuming 
and managing SBOMs from their suppliers. Most, 
if not all, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) 
tools can produce SBOMs today, so commercial 
software suppliers should have the capability to 
produce and share SBOMs. When the next incident 
such as Log4j occurs, having an SBOM for the 
software deployed across your enterprise enables 
you to answer the questions Am I affected? and 
What is affected? This empowers organizations 
to understand where the vulnerability is within 
their environment so they can understand their 
level of exposure, as well as prepare for deploying 
emergency patches if applicable.Additional informationIntroducing self\-service SBOMs \| GitHub Code SecurityChapter 4Critical Cybersecurity ChallengesTracking conformance with standards 
and regulationsIndustry collaboration and public\-private 
partnerships are crucial for advancing global 
supply chain cybersecurity. We are committed to 
meeting international standards, certifications, and 
technology sector regulations, and we keep a close 
eye on our compliance by investing in automated 
tracking and monitoring tools.To make sure our products meet diverse and at 
times conflicting requirements, we align them with 
our SDL framework.This drives us to continuously evaluate our security 
posture through our SDL continuous assurance 
approach rather than assessing compliance at a 
single point in time like other audits. We employ 
automated tools like static analyzers, web scanners, 
and open\-source scanners to assess our code 
and development infrastructure and use manual 
attestations for non\-automated requirements. 
By analyzing assessment results from different 
perspectives, we can identify trends and intervene 
when necessary. This approach helps us prepare for 
new requirements by introducing draft requirements 
that generate reports without alerting developers.Internal Microsoft efforts that

Security Foundation (OpenSSF), Microsoft is 
investing in initiatives to enhance the security of the 
entire open\-source ecosystem. OpenSSF Alpha\-
Omega began in February 2022 and is funded by 
Microsoft, Google, and Amazon Web Services. 
It aims to safeguard society by engaging directly 
with open\-source maintainers and conducting 
expert analysis to improve the security of open\-
source software.EmPaCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 124Through the Alpha component, we provide tailored 
funding to critical open\-source projects, including 
the Eclipse Foundation, the Python Software 
Foundation, the Rust Foundation, Node.js, jQuery, 
ISRG, and OpenSSL. These engagements often 
include the appointment of a security champion 
to drive improvements within the organizations 
projects and embed security in their culture 
and processes.The Omega aspect leverages technology and 
security experts to scale vulnerability detection 
across the top 10,000 critical open\-source projects. 
We use static analysis tools like CodeQL to 
identify and efficiently triage critical vulnerabilities. 
Responsible disclosure, often accompanied by fixes, 
is then shared with the maintainers.Bringing S2C2F to OpenSSFWhen combined with the fact that attacks 
targeting open source software (OSS) have grown 
742 percent on average, securing how developers 
consume OSS is arguably the most important 
aspect of any organizations software supply chain.We recently published and contributed the Secure 
Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F) 
to the OpenSSF, making it available for any 
development team or organization to adopt. It is 
a set of requirements focused on improving the 
security around how developers consume OSS into 
the developer workflow.Chapter 4Critical Cybersecurity ChallengesDue to the fact that OSS makes up 70\-90 percent 
of the code base used by developers,12 and is 
present in 96 percent of modern applications,13 
it has become a crucial dependency in the 
software industry.Microsoft had been operating its OSS security 
and governance program for many years as part 
of the Microsoft SDL, but expanded its scope to 
include a holistic view of supply chain security 
in 2019, now called the S2C2F.We continue to maintain the framework within 
the Supply Chain Integrity working group in 
collaboration with the OpenSSF community. 
Since the S2C2F is a consumption\-focused 
framework, it can be used in addition to existing 
secure development practices. The S2C2F 
requirements have also been organized into 
a maturity model, enabling organizations 
to prioritize what requirements they should 
implement first. We encourage you to consider 
incorporating the S2C2F requirements into 
your organizations security strategy.EmCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 12596%of software contains some

of more than 100 million users. With the rise of 
open\-source vulnerabilities like Log4Shell, it has 
become clear that a vulnerability anywhere can 
become a vulnerability everywhere, and increasing 
resilience needs to be a collective goal. To combat 
this, GitHub puts advanced security capabilities into 
the hands of developers to keep vulnerabilities, 
private keys and other secrets, and malicious code 
from impacting the software that powers the 
modern world.While developers want to focus on writing code, 
security testing and remediation tasks can disrupt 
their workflow and make the software development 
lifecycle less predictable and more expensive. 
GitHubs solution is to make supply chain security 
tools easy and convenient for developers to use 
as they code, building best practices into the daily 
workflow. In addition to our commercial GitHub 
Advanced Security offerings, we make these 
capabilities available free of charge to open\-source

security landscape using AI and 
large language modelsProtecting supply chains depends on strong 
partnerships between suppliers and their customers. 
We have been investing in strengthening our digital 
supply chains by incorporating controls to mitigate 
evolving AI and privacy risks into our supplier 
governance processes and providing our suppliers 
with security awareness training. These controls and 
training help ensure that our suppliers make the 
same commitment to safe, secure, and trustworthy 
AI systems and supply chains that Microsoft has.In addition, we have announced Copilot capabilities 
for Microsoft Supply Chain Center, which uses 
AI and ML to help customers predict and act on 
supply chain disruptions and uses Azure OpenAI 
to generate contextual emails to suppliers to 
help minimize these disruptions in real\-time. 
These technologies will enhance human decision\-
making and analysis and revolutionize how 
organizations manage supply chain risks, but they 
also have their own digital supply chain that needs 
to be made safe, secure, and trustworthy.Inventory and provenance is fundamental to 
supply chain management, and this is also 
true for the digital supply chain underlying AI. 
Understanding the provenance of the data in 
our various supply chains, including how it was 
generated, allows Microsoft to manage supply chainrisks, and to provide appropriate transparency to 
our customers. Microsoft has been investing in 
provenance standards and technologies, such as the 
C2PA specification SBOMs, to support the sharing 
and authentication of provenance information.In May 2023, we released our report, Governing

set of products in the industry, we are continuously 
seeking out and eliminating vulnerabilities before 
threat actors can exploit them. One way that we 
are confronting cybercrime is by leveraging AI and 
large language models (LLMs). LLMs can automate

breakthrough innovationIntroduction from Bret ArsenaultIn the last few months, the world has 
witnessed a wave of innovation as 
organizations apply advanced AI to new 
technologies and use cases. Our industry 
is facing a paradigm shift and taking 
a massive leap forward as technology 
advances incredibly quickly and makes 
daily headlines.The security industry has been focused on 
managing increased risks and innovating to adapt to 
the fast pace of change. We continue to hear from 
our peers, partners, and customers that security has 
never been more critical to the resilience of business 
and society.There has been significant growth in the threat 
landscape as more attackers use increasingly 
sophisticated techniques to compromise an ever\-
growing footprint of services, devices, and users. 
All combined, this creates a larger attack surface 
and threat potential than we have ever dealt with 
before. At Microsoft, we have seen a 23 percent 
annual rise in the cases processed by the Microsoft 
Security Response Center and Security Operations 
Center teams.While human ingenuity and expertise will always 
be a precious and irreplaceable component of 
cyber defense, technology has the potential to 
augment these unique capabilities with the skill sets, 
processing speeds, and rapid learning of modern AI. 
Technology can work alongside us, detect hidden 
patterns and behaviors, and inform a response at 
machine speed with the latest and most advanced 
security practices.99Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Responding with breakthrough innovationcontinuedExperiences based on large language models, like 
ChatGPT, have taken the world by storm in the last 
year. This is in part because they can draw upon a 
vast store of data, leveraging the massive computing 
power available today in the cloud. But what I 
think is more exciting is the real, tangible impact 
that technology like this can drive. AI, together 
with the power of cloud and machine learning, has 
enormous potential. Much like we led the charge on 
password spray detection, two\-factor authentication 
enforcement, and managed device health, we have 
an opportunity to demonstrate how responsible 
AI has the potential to positively transform the 
security landscape.At Microsoft, we are developing first\- and third\-
party solutions for our ever\-increasing number of 
enterprise, government, and consumer customers 
and partners. We have seen developer activity 
double in the last three years, and it is up by 
over 31 percent in the last year alone. This trend 
will accelerate as developers adopt AI powered 
development tools like GitHub Copilot. This will 
require a commensurate increase in threat models, 
code reviews, compliance attestations, and app 
infrastructure assurance to secure resilience.An important contribution we can make is to 
continue to evolve our Security Development 
Lifecycle (SDL) rules and engineering compliance. 
This will ensure continued focus on secure 
engineering practices.We recently simplified, updated, and automated 
our SDL and Operational Security Assurance 
requirements into a single standard. We will increase 
our compliance with the modernized SDL through 
enhanced training, automation, and reporting.We will also deploy Security CoPilotour new AI 
powered incident response assistantacross our 
incident response teams, so that we can both gain 
the benefit of AI in addressing security incidents, 
and so we can improve this valuable new capability 
by providing our development teams with feedback 
based on our real\-world experience.Based on actions needed to meet the growing 
threat landscape, our approach for the next year will 
focus on bringing to bear AI in combating threats 
while also embracing the three SDL principles of 
Secure by Design, Secure by Default, and Secure

over the next two years, 45 percent of 
global organizations will be impacted in 
some way by a supply chain attack.2 This 
challenge has been made more difficult 
for organizations due to the 3\.5 million 
job talent gap in cybersecurity worldwide.To combat this challenge, cybersecurity professionals 
must leverage the latest technologies and

language models 
for cyber defenseLLMs have the potential to greatly 
enhance several aspects of 
cyber defense. Across Microsoft, 
researchers and applied scientists are 
experimenting with and exploring the 
following scenarios:Threat intelligence and analysis: LLMs can help 
cyber defenders gather and analyze data to find 
patterns and trends in cyber threats. They use this 
information to provide recommendations and alerts. 
LLMs also add context to threat intelligence by using 
information from different sources. Additionally, they 
perform technical tasks like reverse engineering and 
malware analysis.Chapter 5Innovating for Security and ResilienceSecurity testing and validation: LLMs can automate 
and enhance security testing and validation 
activities such as penetration testing, vulnerability 
scanning, code analysis, and configuration auditing. 
They generate and execute test cases, evaluate and 
report results, and offer remediation suggestions. 
LLMs can create custom apps and tools for 
specific scenarios, automate repetitive tasks, and 
handle occasional or ad hoc tasks that require 
manual intervention.Security awareness and education: LLMs can help 
cyber defenders create engaging and personalized 
content and scenarios for security awareness and 
education programs. They assess the level of 
security knowledge and skills of the target audience, 
provide feedback and guidance, and generate 
realistic and adaptive cyber exercises and simulations 
for training and testing.Security governance, risk, and compliance (GRC): 
LLMs can assist in automating security governance, 
risk, and compliance (GRC) activities including policy 
development and enforcement, risk assessment
management, audit and assurance, and compliance 
and reporting. They align GRC activities with business 
goals and provide security metrics and dashboards 
for performance measurement. They can also identify 
gaps and issues and offer recommendations to 
improve the organizations security posture, prioritize 
vulnerabilities, and identify remediation suggestions.PrCybersecurity Tech Accord principles mappingindex on page 125\.Security incident response and recovery: LLMs can 
help cyber defenders support and automate security 
incident response and recovery activities such as 
incident triage, containment, eradication, analysis, 
and recovery. They can summarize incidents and 
generate response automation scripts, coordinate 
teams, and document and communicate the incident 
details and actions. LLMs can also help us learn from 
incidents and provide improvement suggestions for 
prevention and mitigation.Security monitoring and detection: LLMs can 
help cyber defenders monitor and detect security 
events and incidents across networks, systems, 
applications, and data. They can analyze data from 
multiple sources, generate prioritized alerts, and 
provide contextual information for investigation and 
response. LLMs can also be valuable in analyzing 
the posture of multicloud environments where 
they can create comprehensive maps of resources, 
estimate potential impacts, and offer risk mitigation 
suggestions. LLMs can also be useful for phish 
detection by analyzing email content and identifying 
textual patterns, anomalies, or suspicious language 
indicative of phishing attempts.102Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Using the power of AI for cybersecurity continuedLowering the 
entry bar for using 
new innovationsWhile LLM\-based solutions show great 
potential for cybersecurity, they are not 
a replacement for human cybersecurity 
experts. Having the right expertise 
is key when it comes to combining 
LLMs and cybersecurity. One solution 
is to bring together the skills of AI 
professionals and cybersecurity experts 
to enhance productivity.Fortunately, the use of LLMs in cybersecurity 
operations is not limited to large organizations 
with abundant resources. These models have been 
trained on vast amounts of data, giving them a pre\-
existing understanding of cybersecurity.However, relying solely on LLMs to tackle 
cybersecurity challenges has its limits, and a data\-
oriented approach that considers enterprise\-specific 
data and the evolving threat landscape is necessary.Without additional finetuning, LLMs are not 
cognizant of the latest cybersecurity threats. 
Therefore, they need to be augmented with 
complementary modules, also called RAG (Retrieval 
Augmented Generation), that interface with relevant 
data sources, tailored analytics, and various threat 
intelligence enrichments. Investing in a solution to 
enable the adequate and flexible orchestration of 
the RAG will be necessary to fully take advantage of 
LLMs for security challenges.Chapter 5Innovating for Security and ResilienceWith a robust LLM\-powered solution, cybersecurity 
analysts can increase productivity with automated 
scans and anomaly detection, pattern identification, 
and root cause evidence discovery. LLMs excel at 
synthesizing complex information and presenting 
it in clear, concise languagehelping analysts 
select the best cyber analytics for different 
scenarios. As the threat landscape evolves and 
analysis techniques expand, even experienced 
analysts can struggle to keep up, and LLMs can 
act as personal assistants, suggesting analysis and 
mitigation options.Organizations should assess their current 
cybersecurity capabilities, identify areas where LLMs 
can be most effective, and invest in the necessary 
expertise and technology to integrate LLMs into 
their existing cybersecurity infrastructure to enhance 
their cybersecurity posture and stay ahead of 
evolving threats.EmCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 125\.Additional informationRetrieval Augmented Generation using Azure 
Machine Learning prompt flow \| Microsoft103Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Using the power of AI for cybersecurity continuedHow Microsoft is 
using large language 
models to improve 
operationsModern AI is particularly effective at 
processing large amounts of data and 
reasoning over the results to complete 
complex tasks. With trillions of security 
signals being analyzed daily, we can use 
these advancements to build a safer, 
more resilient online ecosystem.To demonstrate the potential of this technology 
in addressing complex challenges and driving 
innovation, here are some examples to show 
how weve chosen to use LLMs internally to 
improve security and efficiency in various areas of 
our operations:Intelligent reportsWe are using AI to create intelligent reports that 
provide decision makers with timely and accurate 
insights into open\-source intelligence findings. 
Traditional reports that rely on manual analysis 
of multiple information sources are slow, costly, 
and often outdated by the time they reach their 
audience. This approach hinders organizations 
ability to seize opportunities, mitigate risks, and 
adapt to changing situations. We solved this 
problem by applying the latest Azure OpenAI 
models to revolutionize report generation and 
delivery. These models use natural language 
processing to scan, synthesize, and summarize 
relevant data from various sources, including 
social media and news blogs. This capability 
enables us to produce concise reports based on 
intelligence information from multiple sources 
and can generate high\-quality reports in 
minutes or hoursinstead of days or weeks 
highlighting key trends, patterns, and implications 
for decision makers. Additionally, using the 
latest Azure OpenAI LLMs enables us to update 
reports dynamically as new information becomes 
available, ensuring that insights are always fresh 
and reliable.Chapter 5Innovating for Security and ResilienceChatbot for developer supportLLMs for cloud datacenter securityWe have created a chatbot to support Microsofts 
developers in accessing compliance information and 
guidelines for security standards and regulations. 
This helps them integrate security into their code 
early on, reducing delays, vulnerabilities, and costs in 
the development process. Our chatbot uses our data 
sources and combines Azure Cognitive Search with 
Azure OpenAI models, making it easy and reliable 
for developers to find the relevant compliance data. 
This also reduces the workload and overhead of 
compliance program teams.Natural language interface with your 
security dataWe created a natural language interface that uses 
Azure OpenAI models to help security teams 
analyze and query large amounts of data from logs, 
alerts, events, incidents, and threat intelligence. 
Traditional methods, like structured query language 
or scripting, can be difficult and time\-consuming 
and it may not always provide accurate results. 
Our interface allows users to ask questions in plain 
English and receive quick answers without needing 
to write code or learn syntax.Industrial control systems (ICS) are crucial 
for ensuring security and efficiency in cloud 
datacenters. They are used to automate and 
optimize processes, reduce human error, and 
improve overall efficiency. However, ICS can be 
vulnerable to security threats and require prompt 
identification and resolution. The traditional method 
of analyzing verbose vulnerability advisories and 
implementing mitigations is time\-consuming and 
inefficient. To address this issue, we have developed 
an LLM\-based solution that automatically detects 
affected industrial IoT devices and their locations 
within Azure datacenters. This solution generates 
actionable Agile and DevOps items that technicians 
can execute in seconds, resulting in improved 
security and reliability while reducing operational 
costs and risks.PrEmCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 125\.Additional informationGoverning AI: A Blueprint for the Future \| Microsoft104Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Using the power of AI for cybersecurity continuedDefending 
the increasing 
threat surfaceWe expect many modern apps to 
become LLM\-based in time. These apps 
will have an increased threat surface, 
meaning they will be vulnerable to 
both inadvertent and deliberate 
misalignments, such as command 
injection attacks. As LLM\-based apps 
bring new and unique types of threats, 
we must ensure that our security 
measures and protocols are updated and 
adapted to address these new threats.The challenges will be further complicated by the 
fact that, in the future, it is likely there will be more 
than one platform and multiple paradigms, such 
as Microsofts Semantic Kernel, LangChain, and 
AutoGPT. This will require organizations to include 
new protection capabilities built intrinsically in the 
LLM\-based apps that are agnostic to the platform, 
like an LLM\-based app firewall.We are at the early stage in the journey and new 
challenges are constantly emerging. We need to 
expand app discovery and inventory to address 
unsanctionedunmanaged LLM\-based apps and 
their plug\-ins, and the need to manage enterprise 
boundaries due to emerging LLM\-based solutions 
like personal assistants that mix private and 
corporate data access. The growth of autonomous 
apps that combine LLMs with low\- or no\-code 
platforms also significantly increases the security 
risk for organizations.To build collective resilience against these emerging 
threats and to safeguard our ecosystem, it is crucial 
for organizations to collaborate, innovate, and share 
knowledge and best practices.Chapter 5Innovating for Security and Resilience4Multidisciplinary security reviews are 
crucial for AI systems. Involve data 
scientists, engineering systems people 
and experts in content moderation, digital 
safety, and privacy. LLM systems require 
defenders with expertise in these areas 
because prompt injection attacks often 
involve elements from each discipline.5Zero trust model investments 
can help the defense of LLMs. 
Implement continuous monitoring 
and detection of anomalies and LLM 
models behavioral changes. Limit the 
LLM components access to minimum 
resources required for its scope.To take a multidisciplinary approach to 
addressing the rapidly growing LLM\-level 
attack surface and unique threats:1Educate security teams about the novelthreats that AI systems introduce, 
particularly prompt injection.2Consider the LLM\-based app security 
throughout the lifecycle. Expand risk 
management investments to include end\-
to\-end visibility of LLM\-based app risks 
and mitigation, tightening DevSecOps 
security controls for development 
and operation.3Review security practices for AI\-
integrated products holistically, 
including all components. Assessing only 
the AI component of a system makes it 
difficult to quantify risks and provides 
limited mitigation options. However, 
reviewing the entire system provides 
the full context and more mitigation 
opportunities at different points, making 
the risks more quantifiable.105Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Using the power of AI for cybersecurity continuedInsights on 
emerging security 
trends in large 
language modelsVulnerability reports submitted to 
Microsoft provide valuable insights 
into emerging security trends, 
especially in fast\-changing areas like 
AI. Focusing specifically on LLMs, 
some of our key learnings from recent 
vulnerability reports include:Attacks against LLMs may look significantlydifferent from typical software security attacks. 
For instance, when the attacker can control 
the text that is fed into the LLM, the process of 
developing attacks usually involves searching 
for a well\-crafted natural language sentence to 
input into the model.The main classes of reported vulnerabilities 
involving LLMs have included attempts to 
extract the models system prompt (prompt 
extraction) and attempts to cause the model to 
deviate from its intended behavior (command 
injection), such as jailbreaks.In prompt extraction attacks, it may be difficult 
for the attacker to distinguish whether the 
model has output the real system prompt 
or just a convincing artificially\-generated 
example prompt.Command injection attacks are a central 
concern, especially in cases where these 
could affect other users of the system. 
Comprehensive detection and prevention of 
command injection vulnerabilities remains an 
open research and development question.EmCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 125\.Chapter 5Innovating for Security and ResilienceRed teaming 
AI systems to 
test resilienceIn the security community, red teaming is 
a technique used to test the effectiveness 
of how an organization would respond 
to a genuine cyberattack. It is a double\-
blind exercise in which dedicated 
security operators role\-play as real\-
world adversaries to attain a specific 
goal via scoped tactics, techniques, 
and procedures (TTPs). The point of 
the exercise is to provide a realistic 
assessment of an organizations ability 
to prevent, detect, and respond to a 
particular group of attacker TTPs.Red teaming as an essential practice in the 
responsible development of Microsofts systems and 
features using LLMs. Red teaming with AI systems 
is a little different from traditional cybersecurity red 
teaming.3 The set\-up is similar; in the AI context, thered team emulates real world adversaries or their 
behaviors to find security\-specific flaws in products 
and platforms. Because of the broad range of AI 
used in multiple domains, the AI community uses 
red teaming to find failures in cybersecurity and 
in areas beyond. For instance, can the AI system 
be induced to change personalities? Does it reveal 
sensitive information or harm the security and 
privacy promises made to customers overall? With 
LLMs, both benign and adversarial usage can 
produce potentially harmful outputs. This can take 
many forms, including harmful content such as hate 
speech, incitement or glorification of violence, or 
code with vulnerabilities.In the new era of AI, Microsoft has routinely used red 
teaming to find failures in production systems before 
deploying them in products like Bing Chat and Azure 
OpenAI service.PrCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 125\. Please see the section about Responsible

promises to reshape many aspects of 
society, we must work towards a future of 
responsible AI by design. Responsible AI 
practices are crucial for maintaining user 
trust and privacy, and for creating long\-
term benefits to society.At the same time, the evolution of AI technology, 
such as generative AI models, requires us to also 
evolve cybersecurity practices and threat models 
to address new challenges. Generative AI models 
can create realistic contentincluding text, images, 
video, and audiowhich can be used by threat 
actors to spread misinformation or create malicious 
code. To stay ahead of emerging security threats, 
we must invest in research and development too. 
Microsoft is committed to ensuring that all our AI 
products and services are developed and used in
a manner that upholds our AI principles.Simultaneously, we are working with industry 
partners to develop standards and technologies 
that enable transparent and verifiable information 
about the origin and authenticity of digital content 
to enhance trust online. This includes using 
advanced detection mechanisms to identify and 
mitigate potential risks associated with malicious 
content generation.Across the globe, the appetite for regulatory 
guidance on the responsible development and 
use of AI is growing, with many countries drafting 
documentation offering guidance for managing 
emerging risks associated with AI technologies.

future with innovation 
and collaborationIntroduction from Teresa HutsonAs technology continues to play an 
increasingly important role in our lives, 
it brings both great opportunities and 
significant risks to our fundamental rights 
and ability to engage in society.When we develop technology, we must be 
thoughtful, champion access to critical services, 
and build equity into our solutions. At Microsoft, as 
we work to create a future for everyone, we have 
a responsibility to support peoples digital safety 
and defend against the challenges presented by 
technologically enabled bad actors. We also need 
to uphold human rights, close divides, and partner 
on collaborative initiatives protecting people and 
systems digital security.Across the globe, Microsoft works closely with our 
customers and partners to provide security guidance 
and tools to improve cyber resilience and protect 
the integrity of digital services, especially in the face 
of ever\-evolving threats. For example, the Microsoft 
Threat Analysis Center released a report highlighting 
the increase in Russias espionage attacks and their 
development of new forms of ransomware in March 
2023, and Microsoft announced its investigation of 
an Iranian cyberattack against Albanias government 
in September 2022\. Cybercriminals and threat actors 
are constantly innovating their strategies to leverage 
technological advancementsbut so are we. 
Working together and providing industry\-leading 
solutions are core to our collective defense efforts.In this chapter, we offer insights into our collective 
defense strategies, including support for the World 
Economic Forums Cybercrime Atlas initiative 
and engagement in the Open Source Security 
Foundation. We also highlight strategic partnershipswith threat intelligence organizations to overcome 
attacks like Volt Typhoon and combat the illicit use of 
tools like Cobalt Strike. From our role as a founding 
member of the Coalition for Content Provenance 
and Authenticity (C2PA) to our partnership with 
TruePic to create Project Providence, we show how 
were working together in new ways to bolster our 
customers digital defense capabilities, reduce their 
cyber risks, and further collaborative projects, such 
as documenting evidence of cultural heritage site 
destruction in Ukraine. As part of our commitment 
to defending democracy, Microsofts non\-partisan 
election protection efforts extend globally through 
work with organizations like the International 
Foundation for Election Systems, to help weave 
far\-reaching networks that enable the sharing of 
best practices. Our partnerships to protect elections 
span work with nonprofits including the National 
Democratic Institute, International Republican 
Institute, and Freedom House. These are just a few 
of the many ways in which Microsoft is working 
cooperatively with leading organizations on 
innovative solutions to best meet the challenges 
facing our world today. We are proud to collaborate 
with other leading technology companies and 
cross\-sector partners to advance open\-source 
security, curb cybercrime, safeguard democracy, and 
strengthen media content.Microsoft remains committed to supporting a 
healthy information ecosystem and addressing 
evolving threats within the digital spaces in whichwe operate. Core to this work are diverse strategic 
partnerships and trained cybersecurity professionals.The shortage of cybersecurity professionals and the 
need for AI skills, as discussed in depth later in this 
chapter, pose significant challenges in todays rapidly 
changing digital landscape. Robust partnerships with 
educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, 
governments, and other businesses are central to 
our collective defense efforts and skill\-building 
resources that can enable people to adapt amidst 
constantly shifting challenges. As the threat 
landscape evolves, we look forward to continuing 
these and other collective defense engagements 
with valued partners.Teresa Hutson 
Corporate Vice President, Technology for 
Fundamental RightsPrEmCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 125\.Though threats to the information ecosystem 
have always existed, the tactics adversaries deploy 
in the digital age are constantly evolving. As a 
founding member of the Coalition for Content 
Provenance and Authenticity, Microsoft has 
helped develop technical standards for certifying 
the source and history of media content to help 
combat deepfakes and increase public trust in the 
media they see.111 Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023Chapter 6Collective DefenseHow the global Cybercrime 
Atlas will revolutionize 
cybercrime intelligence 
and collaborationThere is a vast amount of threat 
intelligence and data available, but 
the current fragmented cybersecurity 
landscape means we are not making the 
most of it. That is all about to change 
with the Cybercrime Atlas. It is leveraging 
open\-source intelligence and a global 
collaboration to shape action, policy, 
and regulation.The current landscape of cybercrime 
intelligence is made up of a patchwork 
of research efforts. It is complicated 
by limited cooperation among 
stakeholders, and by cross\-border 
complexities and challenges posed by 
different jurisdictions.As cybercriminals make use of complex, global 
infrastructure, they produce a vast amount of data 
that provides surface\-level threat information. 
But the current state of cybercrime intelligence 
makes it hard to generate meaningful, actionable 
reports that make use of that data.The World Economic Forum (WEF) has launched 
the Cybercrime Atlas initiative with support from 
companies such as Microsoft, Fortinet, PayPal, 
and Santander Group. It brings together a diverse 
community of over 40 private and public sector 
members to centralize knowledge sharing, 
collaboration, and research on cybercrime.PaCybersecurity Tech Accord principlesmapping index on page 125\.The Cybercrime Atlas focuses on cyber\-enabled and 
cyber\-dependent crimes of many types, including 
business email compromise, credit card fraud, malware, 
and ransomware. It leverages open\-source intelligence 
and adopts a global collaborative approach to gather 
human\-vetted intelligence from sectors such as finance, 
technology, telecommunications, cybersecurity, and 
cloud providers.The goal is to disrupt cybercriminals by providing 
intelligence that facilitates actions by law enforcement 
and the private sector, leading to arrests and the 
dismantling of criminal infrastructures. The initiative 
creates additional value by offering evidence\-based 
recommendations for policy and regulation changes.Although still a new initiative, the Cybercrime Atlas 
will create a standardized and scalable model for 
open\-source intelligence research. It maximizes data 
collection while ensuring intelligence is thoroughly 
cleansed, enriched, and vetted by experts from diverse 
industries. Contextualized intelligence collection 
facilitates analysis of links to enable the identification 
of connections between cybercriminals, groups, and 
shared infrastructure. It also uncovers infrastructure 
that is used to facilitate large scale criminal activity 
beyond individual domains or internal protocols (IPs). 
Some examples are money mule organizers (recruited 
by fraudsters to assist in moving and transferring 
illegally obtained funds), bulletproof hosting 
providers (internet hosting services that are resilient to 
complaints of illicit activities), cryptocurrency wallets, 
bank accounts, and communication channels.Microsoft is proud to be supporting the Cybercrime 
Atlas initiative. We look forward to working with the 
WEF on driving intelligence collection, facilitating 
sharing processes, and supporting operations and 
disruptions. Disrupting global cybercriminals requires 
a global effort with robust, trusted relationships and 
collaboration across public and private organizations 
and industries, and we encourage companies around 
the world to consider joining the Cybercrime Atlas.Additional information

These partnerships which span across the security 
industry and government research organizations 
from around the world have become a crucial part 
of our threat hunting process. The mutual benefit toboth parties adds unique value that improves our 
ability to protect our shared customers.As part of our analysis of Volt Typhoon attacks 
against organizations in Guam and the United States, 
these partnerships helped us expand and analyze 
more deeply the telemetry we were seeing within 
our customer environments. Working across private

cracked versions 
of Cobalt StrikeOur extensive threat research revealed how 
widespread the use of cracked versions of Cobalt 
Strike is in ransomware attacks. Cracked software 
generally involves circumventing licensing and 
usage restrictions on commercial software 
by illegal methods such as modifying code. 
The cracked version of Cobalt Strike can be 
used as a post\-exploitation tool, enabling 
cybercriminals to elevate and enumerate 
access after compromising a victims system. 
Numerous cybercrime groups have incorporated 
cracked Cobalt Strike into their attack chains.To disrupt these activities, Microsofts Digital 
Crimes Unit (DCU) tracked the command and 
control (C2\) infrastructure of Cobalt Strike team 
servers associated with malware campaigns. 
We collaborated with Fortra, the owner and 
licensor of Cobalt Strike, to identify cracked 
versions of the tool. Fortra licenses Cobalt 
Strike individually to its customers, each 
with a unique product key or watermark.Top 10 countries hosting cracked versions of Cobalt Strike

Uniting to empower nonprofits 
with cyber resilienceHumanitarian organizations play an 
essential role in aiding those who need 
help most and often do the impossible 
with extremely limited resources. 
As a result, those resources often do not 
stretch to cybersecurity. Research shows 
that fewer than 15 percent of NGOs 
have cybersecurity experts as staff and 
that the vast majority do not implement 
critical cyber hygiene practices, such as 
multifactor authentication.In a world where cyberattacks target organizations 
helping persons fleeing war, data of survivors of 
violence are sold online, and humanitarian actors 
are targeted for surveillance. This is an unsustainable 
position. There is an urgent need to help NGOs 
protect themselves from cyber threats.We are therefore extremely proud to support 
initiatives such as the Humanitarian Cybersecurity 
Center, launched by the CyberPeace Institute. 
The Humanitarian Cybersecurity Center provides 
expert support and practical, free cybersecurity 
assistance to humanitarian organizations located 
anywhere in the world, tailored to their needs.However, it goes beyond working to strengthen the 
cybersecurity posture of the affected organizations. 
The CyberPeace Institute investigates and analyzes 
cyberattacks against NGOs and then creates 
actionable threat intelligence that can be shared with 
the community and helps scale protections beyond 
a single entity.Over the past year, Microsoft has significantly
