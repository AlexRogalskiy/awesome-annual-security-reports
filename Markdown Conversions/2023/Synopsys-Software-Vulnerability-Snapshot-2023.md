researchers and Synopsys Security Testing Services consultants used anonymized data from three 
years of tests conducted on commercial software systems and applications.The Synopsys tests shed light on persistent vulnerabilities that are significant challenges to web and 
software application security, especially the top vulnerabilities related toInformation disclosureleakage and privacyMisconfigurationsInsufficient transport layer protectionThe tests underscore the ongoing dangers posed by vulnerable third\-party libraries and the need for 
robust software supply chain security in software development environments, where well over 90% 
of software contains open source. The following data also shows the value of extending application 
security testing beyond basic static analysis.If youre in charge of a software security program, getting a deeper view into software risk can help 
you plan strategic improvements in your security efforts. If youre looking at security from the tactical 
side, you can use the information in this report to present a business case for the need to expand 
your security testing with third\-party assistance.Security Issues Found in the TestsIn 2020, 97% of the tests found vulnerabilities. In 2021, that figure dropped to 95%, and it decreased 
even further in 2022, to 83%. Over all three years of collected data, 92% of the tests uncovered 
vulnerabilities in the target applications.The continual decrease in overall vulnerabilities is an encouraging sign that development teams are 
improving their ability to write error\-free code and that practices such as code reviews, automated 
testing, and continuous integration are helping to reduce common programming errors.Advancements in programming languages and integrated development environments (IDEs) now 
provide built\-in checks and tools that help developers catch errors before they become significant 
issues. In the case of popular open source projects, many communities have also ramped up their 
scrutiny of code, leading to higher quality standards.Unfortunately, the same cant be said for less popular or older open source projects. According to 
some reports, nearly 20% of open source projects across Java and JavaScript that were maintained 
in 2022 are no longer being maintained today, opening those projects to vulnerabilities and exploits.Percentages of tests that 
found vulnerabilities97%95%83%202020212022 synopsys.com\|1High\- and Critical\-Severity VulnerabilitiesOver all three years, 27% of the tests found high\-severity vulnerabilities, and 6\.2% revealed critical\-
severity vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities allowing cross\-site scripting (XSS) have consistently been 
one of the top high\-severity vulnerabilities found in Synopsys tests over the years. Similarly, the top 
critical\-severity vulnerability, SQL injection, has remained the leader from 2020 to 2022\.Breaking it down by year, we saw a small increase in high\-severity vulnerabilities between 2022 and 
2021 (25% vs. 20%) and a decrease (25% vs. 30%) when comparing 2022 to 2020\. Critical\-severity 
vulnerabilities were higher (6\.7%) in the 2022 tests than in 2021 (4\.5%) or 2020 (6\.1%).Many medium\- through critical\-severity vulnerabilities 
require multilayered testing in order to be uncovered.Percentage of high\- 
and critical\-severity 
vulnerabilities 2020\-22High\-severity vulnerabilitiesThe numbers reflect that high\- and critical\-severity vulnerabilities have been increasing in the 
past few years and hit an all\-time high in 2022\. Some 80% of CVEs reported in 2022 were either 
medium or high severity, with 16% deemed critical. While development teams are reducing overall 
vulnerabilities, the data indicates that many medium\- through critical\-severity vulnerabilities require 
more robust testingsuch as penetration testingin order to be uncovered.25%20%30%202220212020CriticalHighMedium202228%38%60%202154%46%64%202077%63%72%Figure 1\. Reduction in percentage of vulnerabilities found in retests compared to original testsFigure 1 illustrates that dynamic testingsuch as some types of penetration testing and dynamic 
application security testing (DAST)is an effective supplement to static application security testing 
(SAST). A sampling of retests (that is, quick validations that specific fixes have been applied) show 
customers reducing critical high and medium\-severity vulnerabilities in each of the three years 
once vulnerabilities have been found. For example, in 2022, medium\-severity vulnerabilities were 
found to have been reduced by 60%, while high\- and critical\-severity vulnerabilities were reduced by 
38% and 28% respectively.Critical\-severity vulnerabilities6\.7%4\.5%6\.1%202220212020 synopsys.com\|2Defining Severity LevelsSeverity levels reflect the risk a vulnerability poses to network security, as rated on the CVSS v3 
scale. Critical\-severity vulnerabilities have a CVSS score ranging from 9\.0 to 10\.0 and an exploit 
or proof\-of\-concept code publicly available or being actively exploited. They include, for example, 
command, code, and SQL injection exploits.High\-severity vulnerabilities have a CVSS score ranging from 7\.0 to 8\.9 and are usually more 
difficult to exploit than critical vulnerabilities. They still should be reviewed and addressed promptly, 
considering factors such as the business criticality of the at\-risk applicationsystem and the threat 
landscape.With more attackers using automated exploitation tools that can attack thousands of systems 
in a matter of seconds, fixing high\- and critical\-risk vulnerabilities can become urgent whenever 
those vulnerabilities are discovered, not least because well over half of reported vulnerabilities are 
exploited within a week of disclosure.Security or vulnerability issues in deployed applications tend to cascade downhill, not only through 
their potential of disrupting an organizations (or its customers) business operations, but also 
through their impact on the entire SDLC, and in extension, the software supply chain.In fact, over 80% of respondents in the Synopsys Global State of DevSecOps 2023 report said that 
the need to address a critical securityvulnerability issue had impacted their organizations software 
delivery schedule during 2022\-23\.About Synopsys Security Testing ServicesDevelopment teams are being asked to build increasingly

represented in this report synopsys.com\|3A Synopsys report on the strategies, tools, and practices impacting software security notes that 
over 33% of 1,000 respondents pointed to inadequate security training as a major roadblock, 
a figure closely followed by a shortage of security personnel (31%). Thirty\-three percent of the 
reports respondents also said that external consultants were aiding in security testing for their 
organizations.It can be invaluable to contract third\-party security testers to gain an unbiased view of an 
organizations security posture. In fact, the Building Security in Maturity Model (BSIMM) report 
has found that more than 88% of the organizations participating in the BSIMM project use external 
penetration testers to supplement their security activities. These tests can uncover issues that 
might have been missed by internal testing, potentially highlighting a weak link in an organizations 
security practices.Even if you feel your organization has adequate security testing coverage, you may want to validate 
your own testing and ensure that your internal security controls are working. Or you may need to 
comply with regulatory, customer, or other requirements that mandate third\-party assessments. 
For example, Requirement 11 of PCI DSS 4\.0 specifically mandates the performance of regular 
penetration testing. This requirement is applicable to merchants that need to do a formal audit and 
is also applicable to all service providers.The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires healthcare practitioners 
to protect electronically stored, health information using technical safeguards to ensure the 
confidentiality and security of the information. While HIPAA does not specifically require a 
penetration test or vulnerability scan, it does mandate a risk analysis, which effectively requires 
covered entities to test their security controls.The section of HIPAA that addresses evaluation specifically calls out periodic technical and 
nontechnical evaluation methods. And in its HIPAA guidance, the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) cites external andor internal penetration testing as the recommended 
method of meeting these technical evaluation requirements, where reasonable and appropriate.In the financial services world, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) establishes the 
cybersecurity rules for financial organizations and recommends running penetration tests regularly 
and after key events, such as significant changes to a firms infrastructure or access controls. 
Since 2022, and with an enforcement deadline in June 2023, the Gramm\-Leach\-Bliley Act (GLBA) 
explicitly requires financial institutions to perform annual penetration testing and vulnerability 
scanning as part of their security activities.A Synopsys report

black box and gray box testing, with the goal of identifying vulnerabilities that can then be triaged 
and remediated as necessary. Black box testing approaches the targets security state from an 
outsiders perspective, whereas gray box testing simulates an authenticated user with credentials
essentially extending black box testing with deeper insights. Tests were largely conducted on web 
(82%) and mobile (13%) systemsapplications, with a smaller number of network (3\.0%) and source 
code (2\.0%) targets.Pen TestingSixty\-six percent of the tests were penetration testsan authorized simulated attack performed 
on a computer system to evaluate its security. Penetration testers use the same tools, techniques, 
and processes as attackers to find and demonstrate the business impacts of weaknesses in a 
system. Penetration tests examine whether a system is robust enough to withstand attacks from 
authenticated and unauthenticated positions, as well as a range of system roles.Often required to comply with industry regulations and standards, external pen testing brings added 
benefits such as an unbiased viewpoint of your security posture, as well as an accurate simulation of 
potential threats and vulnerabilities that external adversaries might exploit.A comprehensive approach to pen testing is essential for optimal risk management. Synopsys pen 
testing may include targets such asWeb apps.Testers examine the effectiveness of security controls and look for hidden 
vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and any other potential security gaps that can lead to a 
compromise of a web app. Mobile appsdevices.Using both automated and extended manual testing, testers look forvulnerabilities in application binaries running on a mobile device and the corresponding server\-
side functionality. Server\-side vulnerabilities include session management, cryptographic 
issues, authentication and authorization issues, and other common web service vulnerabilities. 
Vulnerabilities in application binaries can include authentication and authorization issues, client\-
side trust issues, misconfigured security controls, and cross\-platform development framework 
issues. Networks.This testing identifies critical security vulnerabilities in an external network andsystems. Experts employ a checklist that includes test cases for encrypted transport protocols, 
SSL certificate scoping issues, use of administrative services, and more. Three percent (2\.7%) 
of the pen tests conducted over all three years were network security penetration tests.Types of tests conducted

MAST synopsys.com\|5 APIs.Both automated and manual testing techniques are used to cover the OWASP APISecurity Top 10 list. Some of the security risks and vulnerabilities testers look for include broken 
object\-level authorization, user authentication, excessive data exposure, lack of resourcesrate 
limiting, and more.Expert pen testers thinking and acting like adversaries introduce a needed human element, as they 
analyze data to target their attacks and test systems and websites in ways automated testing 
solutions following a scripted routine cannot. Plus, some vulnerabilities cant be easily detected 
by automated testing toolsthey require human oversight to be uncovered. For example, the only 
effective way to detect an insecure direct object reference (IDOR), an issue that allows attackers to 
gain access to unauthorized data, is by performing a manual test.DASTDynamic application security tests (DAST) were 15% of the tests conducted over all three years. 
DAST is a method of application security (AppSec) testing in which testers examine an application 
while its running but have no knowledge of the applications internal interactions or designs at the 
system level, and no access or visibility into the source program. This type of black box testing 
looks at an application from the outside\-in, examines its running state, and observes its responses 
to simulated attacks made by a testing tool. An applications responses to these simulations help 
determine whether the application is vulnerable and could be susceptible to a real malicious attack.The goal is to find outcomes or results that were not expected and could therefore be used by 
attackers to compromise an application. Since DAST tools dont have internal information about the 
application or the source code, they attack just as an external hacker wouldwith the same limited 
knowledge and information about the application.DAST solutions can find runtime vulnerabilities that are tough to spot through other security tests. 
These vulnerabilities include authentication and server configuration errors, code injection, SQL 
injection, and cross\-site scripting errors.As noted earlier in this report, human oversight is sometimes needed to develop a full software 
security picture. Synopsys DAST evaluations include manual testing to uncover vulnerabilities 
that typically cant be found by out\-of\-the\-box tools, such as some vulnerabilities pertaining to 
authentication and session management, access control, and information leakage.MASTThirteen percent of the tests conducted over all three years were mobile application security 
testing (MAST) tests. Synopsys mobile application security testing focuses on analyses of mobile 
client\-side code, server\-side code, and third\-party library analysis to systematically find and fixHuman oversight is 
sometimes needed to 
develop a full software 
security picture. synopsys.com\|6security vulnerabilities in mobile applications, without the need for source code. Synopsys uses 
a combination of proprietary static and dynamic analysis tools working together to discover 
vulnerabilities and offers multiple depths of analysis, tuning the level of testing according to the risk 
profile of each tested application.Despite the widespread adoption of mobile apps, most development and security teams have been 
slow to embrace mobile security. Statistics fromNowSecures MobileRiskTrackerindicate that 85% 
of mobile apps in public app stores include one or more high\-risk vulnerability or violate one or more 
OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standards. And 70% leak private data, potentially 
breaching GDPRCCPA and other privacy regulations.Vulnerabilities OverviewThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 and Common Weakness Enumeration 
(CWE) Top 25 are lists of the most common and dangerous security vulnerabilities. Both are based 
on data from a variety of sources, including security researchers, vulnerability databases, and 
incident reports.The OWASP Top 10 list represents a consensus among a large group of developers and web 
application security teams on the most critical security risks to web applications. The CWE Top 25 
list was created by MITRE in collaboration with the SANS Institute to rank the 25 most dangerous 
software vulnerabilities. While intended as awareness documents, many organizations use both lists 
as de facto security standards to measure the effectiveness of their security controls.The OWASP Top 10 list focuses on security risks specific to web applications, whereas the CWE Top 
25 list focuses on software weaknesses and their related CWEs.As shown in Figure 2, there is overlap between the two lists, even when their terminology differs. For 
example, OWASP category A05:2021Security Misconfiguration is related to various weaknesses 
listed in the CWE Top 25, such as CWE\-798 (Use of Hard\-Coded Credentials) and CWE\-276 (Incorrect 
Default Permissions).Fingerprinting (probing a web application to gain information) could arguably be placed in the 
OWASP Top 10 lists Security Logging and Monitoring Failures or Broken Access Control categories 
(weve listed it under the former), although it is not directly referred to in either category. Similarly, 
the closest CWE related to fingerprinting is probably Exposure of Sensitive Information to an 
Unauthorized Actor (CWE\-200\). As shown in rows 1, 4, 6, and 9 of Figure 2, information disclosure
leakage in various aspects was an issue found in many of the tests.85% of mobile apps in 
public app stores include 
one or more high\-risk 
vulnerability. synopsys.com\|7Top 10 Synopsys

over the years. An interesting exception is Application Misconfiguration, which moved to \#5 in 
2022 after two years at \#9\.Misconfigurations can occur in applications, browsers, networks, operating systems, and servers. 
For example, Optus, the Australian telecommunications giant, experienced a severe breach in 2022 
that exposed the personal data of 9\.7 million customers. A misconfiguration in the companys 
firewall, allowing third\-party contractors to access sensitive customer data, led to the breach.Human error is typically the most common cause of misconfiguration issues. Organizations fail to 
adequately examine their applications and deployment scripts, leaving themselves vulnerable to 
attack. Configurations are altered during testing procedures and the alterations are not reverted to 
more secure settings. New hardware and software are not properly tested to meet organizations 
security requirements.The Application Misconfiguration position jump illustrates the need for multiple security testing 
tools rather than relying on one to do the job. While organizations may be doing a good job 
lowering their overall number of coding vulnerabilities, they shouldnt rely on a single testing tool, 
especially when it comes to runtime environments. A broad spectrum of testing tools is needed to 
uncover issues, such as misconfigurations, in running applications.The top 10 vulnerability categories found in the 2022 tests are the following:1\.Information Disclosure, also known as Information Leakage. This security issue occurs when 
sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized parties. For example, a website might leak 
data about users, such as usernames or financial information, through some type of security 
misconfiguration. An average 19% of the total vulnerabilities found over all three years of 
testing were directly related to information leakage issues.The OWASP team lists information disclosure under the A01:2021Broken Access Control 
category and notes that more vulnerabilities fit into this category than any other category. 
Notable vulnerabilities in this category include exposure of sensitive information to an 
unauthorized actor, exposure of sensitive information through sent data, and cross\-site 
request forgery.An average 19% of the total 
vulnerabilities found over 
all three years of testing 
were directly related to 
information leakage issues. synopsys.com\|92\.Server (Security) Misconfiguration. A member of the OWASP A05:2021SecurityMisconfiguration category, server misconfigurations represented an average 18% of the 
total vulnerabilities found over all three years of testing. While our results focus on server 
misconfigurations, security misconfigurations can happen at any level of an application stack, 
including the network services, platform, web server, application server, database, frameworks, 
custom code, and preinstalled virtual machines, containers, or storage (see category \#5\). Such 
flaws frequently give attackers unauthorized access to system data or functionality, occasionally 
even resulting in a complete system compromise.An average 11% of vulnerabilities found over all
three years of testing were related to insufficient 
transport layer protection.3\.Insufficient Transport Layer Protection. These are security weaknesses caused by applications 
not taking measures to protect network traffic. During authentication, applications may use SSL
TLS, but they often fail to use it elsewhere in the application, thereby leaving data and session 
IDs exposed.Many mobile applications have specific issues with insufficient transport layer security, to the 
point where OWASP has dedicated a category in its OWASP Mobile Top 10 list to it. As OWASP 
notes, mobile applications frequently do not protect network traffic. They may use SSLTLS 
during authentication but not elsewhere. This inconsistency leads to the risk of exposing data 
and session IDs to interception. An average 11% of vulnerabilities found over all three years of 
testing were related to insufficient transport layer protection.4\.Insufficient Authorization. These vulnerabilities can potentially permit users to access data, 
content, or functionality that they should not be able to reach. This could happen when an 
application or system does not properly verify the identity of users or fails to enforce proper 
access controls.A mobile app transmitting a users roles or permissions unencrypted to a back\-end system as 
part of a request is an example of insecure authorization. OWASP notes that the presence of 
IDOR vulnerabilities is often indicative of code not performing a valid authorization check. An 
average 9% of vulnerabilities found over all three years of testing were related to insufficient 
authorization issues.Server misconfigurations 
represented an 
average 18% of the total 
vulnerabilities found over 
all three years of testing. synopsys.com\|105\.Application Misconfiguration. Another example of the prevalence of security misconfigurations, thisis also the fifth\-most\-dangerous risk on the OWASP list of its top 10 vulnerabilities.Many applications come with developer features that are dangerously unsafe if not deactivated 
when deployed, such as debug and QA features. Configuration files that are not properly locked down 
may reveal clear text (that is, unencrypted text that can be read by anyone), and default settings 
in configuration files may not have been set with security in mind. An average 5% of vulnerabilities 
found over all three years of testing were related to application misconfiguration issues.6\.Application Privacy Failures. Related to information leakagedisclosure, application privacy failure 
occurs when an application has not been properly designed, implemented, or patched, resulting in 
a potential privacy breach in which an unauthorized user can access data or content. Questions 
organizations need to ask about privacy in the applications they build include Are our developers trained regarding web application privacy? Are secure coding guidelines being applied? Is our software (including server, database, library code) being kept up\-to\-date? Are patches being applied regularly? What measures are being taken to ensure that third\-party and open source code used in oursoftware is secure and up\-to\-date? Is personal data being deleted after used for a specified purpose?An average 5% of vulnerabilities found over all three years of testing were related to privacy issues.7\.Insufficient Authentication. Previously known as Broken Authentication, the OWASP A07:2021
Identification and Authentication Failures category now includes vulnerabilities related to 
identification failures, which includes both \#4 and \#7 in our list. An average 5% of vulnerabilities 
found over all three years of testing were related to insufficient authentication.Insufficient authentication and authorization refers to security vulnerabilities in which an application 
or system does not properly verify the identity of users or fails to enforce proper access controls. 
Unauthorized users could potentially access sensitive information or execute actions they should not 
be able to perform, resulting in security issues including data breaches and data loss.8\.Content SpoofingContent Injection. Content spoofing, also known as content injection, is an attack 
targeting users made possible by a vulnerability in a web application that does not properly handle 
user\-supplied data.This can occur when an attacker supplies content to a web application, and that application presents 
it to unsuspecting users, typically as a modified page under the context of the trusted domain. 
OWASP notes that this type of attack is widely misunderstood as a common web vulnerability withMany applications 
come with developer 
features that are 
dangerously unsafe if 
not deactivated when 
deployed, such as 
debug and QA features. synopsys.com\|11little to no impact. In reality, content spoofing attacks have been used in a variety of scams in 
which attackers pose as a legitimate entity to trick users into providing login credentials.Of more concern is that content spoofing has the potential to launch dangerous attacks 
including code injection and cross\-site scripting. An average 4% of vulnerabilities found over all 
three years of testing were related to content spoofing or content injection.9\.Susceptibility to Fingerprinting. Fingerprinting (probing a web application to gain information)can provide attackers with valuable information such as OS type, OS version, SNMP information, 
domain names, network blocks, VPN points, and more. An average 3% of vulnerabilities found 
over all three years of testing were related to vulnerabilities associated with fingerprinting.Many of the specific fingerprinting security issues the tests uncovered are considered minimal, 
low, or medium risk. That is, the issues are not directly exploitable by attackers to gain access to 
systems or sensitive data. Nonetheless, surfacing these vulnerabilities is not an empty exercise, 
as even lower\-risk vulnerabilities can be exploited to facilitate attacks.For example, a security issue associated with fingerprinting, verbose server banners (Figure 
5\), was consistently found in a third of the pen tests and nearly half the DAST scans. Although 
a medium\-risk vulnerability, a verbose server banner could provide attackers with enough 
informationsuch as server name, type, and version numberto launch an attack.Percentage of

Top 10 critical\-risk vulnerabilities found in 2022 (excludes retests)10\. Exposure to Client\-SideCross\-Site Scripting Attacks. The \#1 or \#2 high\-risk vulnerability found 
in all three years of Synopsys testing, cross\-site scripting (XSS) is a client\-side code injection 
attack. The attacker attempts to execute malicious scripts in a victims web browser by including 
malicious code in a legitimate web page or web application. Of all high\-risk vulnerabilities found in 
the 2022 tests, 19% were found to be associated with cross\-site scripting attacks (See Figure 3\).Implementing or securing protections such as a content security policy (CSP) can provide an 
added layer of security that helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including cross\-
site scripting as well as data injection attacks (the \#1 critical\-risk vulnerability found in the tests. 
See Figure 4\). An attacker could use insecure transmissions of user data, such as cookies and 
forms, to inject a command into the system shell on a web server, and then leverage privileges to 
compromise the server.An insecure or absent CSP might be considered a low\-risk concern to many organizations. 
However, the prevalence of cross\-site scripting, clickjacking, and cross\-site leak exploits makes 
a strong argument for having a CSPand more importantly, a CSP to prevent malicious scripts 
from executing on the client sideas a second layer of protection against various types of attacks, 
including cross\-site scripting and data injection attacks.SQL command 
injection was the \#1 
critical\-risk vulnerability 
found in the tests. synopsys.com\|13The Danger of Vulnerable Third\-Party LibrariesAs shown in Figure 6, 25% of the tests conducted by Synopsys in 2022 flagged Vulnerable Third\-
Party Libraries in Use, correlating with the OWASP Top 10 category A06:2021Vulnerable and 
Outdated Components. OWASP notes that your software is likely vulnerable if you do not know the 
versions of all components you have in use, (both client and server side), including the third\-party 
and open source components your software uses.Percentage in Total

software, as it can dramatically increase the speed and efficiency of software builds. The 
accessibility and convenience of proven code means that software developers dont have to waste 
time and limited resources reinventing the wheel.However, according to the annual Synopsys Open Source Security and Risk Analysis report, open 
source code isnt without risk. In fact, the 2023 report found higher open source security risks than 
ever beforeand that most businesses dont have a good handle on whats in their own code.The report found that high\-risk open source vulnerabilities have increased at a staggering rate 
over the past five years (557% in the retail and eCommerce space alone). On top of that, there was 
a disturbing lack of security patching and maintenance of project dependencies (91% included 
outdated open source components).Most businesses dont 
have a good handle on 
whats in their own code. synopsys.com\|14In light of high\-profile supply chain attacks, software supply chain security has become a major 
concern for organizations dependent on third\-party software, which is literally nearly every modern\-
day organization. To better manage supply chain risk, more and more organizations are using 
automated tools to generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to identify the third\-party and open 
source software they include.Evidence of the movement toward SBOMs can be seen in the increase of the create Bills of 
Materials for software security activity recorded in the BSIMM report. BSIMM data also indicates 
significant increases in the identify open source and control open source risk activities due to the 
rise of attacks against vulnerable open source projects.With many companies having hundreds of applications or software systems in use, each themselves 
likely dependent on hundreds to thousands of different third\-party and open source components, an 
accurate, up\-to\-date SBOM is urgently needed to effectively track those components.Insights and RecommendationsImplement a multilayered security approach. Relying on a single security testing solution 
such as static application security testing (SAST) is no longer sufficient. Organizations should 
implement a security approach that combines SAST to identify coding flaws, DAST to examine 
running applications, software composition analysis (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities introduced 
by third\-party components, and penetration testing to identify issues such as misconfigurations 
as well as vulnerabilities that may be missed by other tests.In the Synopsys Global State of DevSecOps 2023 report, 44% of respondents named external 
pen testing as a key element of their security testing and a complement to other testing. External 
pen testing brings benefits such as an unbiased, third\-party viewpoint of your security posture, 
as well as accurate simulation of potential threats and vulnerabilities that other tests might not 
uncover and that attackers might exploit.Combine automated and manual security testing. As important as automated testing is for 
consistency, scalability, and time and cost\-savings, the human factor adds a layer of insight and 
adaptability that is essential for identifying complex and subtle security issues. For example, the 
very nature of DAST as black box testing (that is, without knowledge of an applications internal 
structure) requires developer and security experts to verify and triage findings.Prioritize patch management. Stay vigilant about patching vulnerabilities promptly, especially 
in third\-party and open source components. Establish clear processes to identify, evaluate, and 
apply patches swiftly to mitigate potential exploits.The most dangerous 
vulnerability in your 
software is the one youre 
not aware is there. synopsys.com\|15Employ strong access controls. Enforce policies of stringent access controls across 
applications and networks. Implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users have 
the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. Regularly review and update 
access permissions in your applications to prevent unauthorized access.Integrate SBOM generation into your software development life cycle. The most dangerous 
vulnerability in your software is the one youre not aware is there. By identifying components with 
a comprehensive inventory, you can better assess your security status and respond effectively to 
vulnerability issues when they arise.Determine whether you need to supplement your security testing. Does your team have 
sufficient application security skills and resources to test for security defects? Do they have the 
time to test your software at the level demanded by regulators and your customers?Choose a vendor that can augment your team with on\-demand, expert security testing.
