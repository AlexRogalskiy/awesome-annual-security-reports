Critical 
VulnerabilitiesWhile the total number ofvulnerabilities is an importantmetric for gauging the health ofan environment, as we will coverin this report, vulnerabilities arenot created equal.Some vulnerabilities may pose mostly theoretical risk (low likelihood) and lowimpact if they are exploited, while on the opposite side of the spectrum, othervulnerabilities have high likelihoods of exploitation, and their exploitation mayresult in a highly negative impact to the affected organization(s).Measurement of a vulnerabilitys impact will relate to its impactExploitation of criticalto the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data withina system or organization. The most severe vulnerabilities willvulnerabilities will:
Likely result in total compromiseimpact all three of these basic tenets of information security.of a device or infrastructure.Vulnerabilities categorized as critical are those withcharacteristics that make their exploitation a potentially high\-impact security event.The way Microsoft classifies the severity rating for avulnerability is distinct from the likelihood of exploitation.However, the likelihood of exploitation is far more dynamic as,generally speaking, attackers are far more likely to exploit aknown vulnerability.Have fewer prerequisites. Usually,the attack would not requireany special access, privileges, oradvanced knowledge.Allow code execution withoutuser interaction. These generallydo not rely on a user beingsocially\-engineered.These are the types of vulnerabilities that keepIT admins awake at night and pose the most riskand challenges to businesses.82023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionHow does Microsoft classify 
critical vulnerabilities?The National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD) classifies critical vulnerabilities as those given aCommon Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 9\.0 \- 10\.0\. The more enthusiastic readers ofMicrosofts vulnerability announcements may have noticed that, while Microsoft now uses CVSS3\.1 scoring for their vulnerabilities, they rank severities based on Microsofts own Security UpdateSeverity Rating System. This rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome,should that vulnerability be exploited.This means that, while only 22 Microsoftvulnerabilities from 2022 scored a nine orabove (making them critical under theNational Vulnerability Database scoringsystem), Microsoft has classified 89 of itsvulnerabilities as critical.CVSS 3\.1 RatingsSeverityBase Score RangeNoneLowMediumHighCritical0\.00\.1 \- 3\.94\.0 \- 6\.97\.0 \- 8\.99\.0 \- 10\.0RatingDescriptionCriticalA vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution without user interaction. These scenarios include 
self\-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs 
without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email. Microsoft recommends that 
customers apply Critical updates immediately.ImportantA vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, 
or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where a client 
is compromised with warnings or prompts regardless of the prompts provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of 
user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered. Microsoft recommends that customers apply 
Important updates at the earliest opportunity.ModerateImpact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or 
applicability only to non\-default configurations. Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the
security update.LowImpact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft 
recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems.Microsofts severity rating system may offer better insights for prioritization of risk reduction.92023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionThe difference between CVSS scoring and Microsofts severity 
rating system is worth noting, not only when considering the data 
in this report, but also when considering risk in your organization. 
CVSS scores measure the technical severity of a vulnerability.For example, whether a vulnerability results in some loss of data confidentiality or total loss ofconfidentiality. CVSS scoring does not measure the risk of that vulnerability. This means CVSS scores 
alone cannot tell you whether a vulnerability will cause a mission\-critical impact on a system, or if thelimited loss of some highly sensitive data would have a more severe impact than the total loss of non\-sensitive data.Microsofts severity rating system is potentially far more useful than a base or temporal CVSS scorefor security practitioners trying to prioritize risk reduction. However, it is important to know your ownenvironment and risks so you can understand how best to prioritize patches andor use other securityhardening controls and mitigations.All of the data provided by Microsofts severity rating system is based on the information thatwas available at the time, and lacks the context of your own organizations threat models. What isconsidered a critical patch for one organization may not be so for another organizationit all dependson the business context.In addition to their Security Update Severity Rating System, Microsoft also published an ExploitabilityIndex to help customers understand the likelihood of exploitation. This can be useful informationfor those needing help with prioritization of security updates. As a word of caution, this informationreflects the likelihood of exploitation at the time the security update was published. It may not reflectthe real\-world exploitability that develops in the following weeks or months as more threat actorsweaponize the vulnerability. The index is best used for very short\-term prioritization of updates ratherthan as a justification to significantly delay patching.102023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionReport Retrospective

However, if we look at the longer\-term trend, we can see that the number ofvulnerabilities appears to be plateauing a little after years of significant growth.Why are we seeing this pattern? To quote The Notorious B.I.G Mo Money Mo Problems, and this 
appears to be very much the case for Microsoft. To increase their revenue, they create new products andimprove existing ones. At the same time, these new offerings potentially increase the attack surface byproviding new code.In addition, the more customers you have, the more people are looking at your softwarefrom internalresearch teams to external pen testers, as well as ill\-bent nation states and cyber criminals.112023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionMicrosofts Annual Revenue Worldwide fromFY 2002 to FY 2022 (in Billion USD)2502001501005028\.37 32\.19 36\.84 39\.79 44\.2860\.42 58\.44 62\.48 69\.94 73\.72 77\.8551\.1286\.8393\.5889\.9585\.32125\.84110\.36198\.27168\.09143\.022

2So, does Mo Money really cause Mo Problems? While this isnt an exact measure, if we look at Microsofts 
total revenue from 2013 to 2022 and compare that with the total number of Microsoft vulnerabilities, we can seea similar trend, with both revenue and vulnerabilities almost doubling between 2017 and 2020\.Moreover, if we drill down into the product areas with the biggest growth, we see Microsoft Azure andDynamics 365 not only making the biggest financial gains for the company (cloud revenue accounted for 51\.4%of Microsofts total revenue in 2022\), but also representing the largest gain in vulnerabilities, as represented byboth the increase in number of vulnerabilities (70\) and the percentage increased (159%) in 2022\.122023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionMicrosoft Critical Vulnerabilities (2013 \- 2022\)2512402351891891921961048930020010001472013201420152016201720182019 2020 20212022The number of critical Microsoftvulnerabilities reached their lowest pointacross the 10 years of this report.Critical Microsoft vulnerabilities dropped55% since 2020, indicating a decrease inthe overall level of risk associated withindividual vulnerabilities.In this 10th year of the Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report, we saw two records set 
for vulnerabilities that seem to highlight opposing trends. While the total number of 
Microsoft vulnerabilities reached its highest recorded number in 2022, the number of criticalvulnerabilities hit their lowest number, with less than half the number of critical vulnerabilitiesappearing in 2022 than we saw in 2020\. In 2022, only 6\.9% of Microsofts vulnerabilities wererated as critical, while in 2013, a substantial 44% of all Microsoft vulnerabilities were classifiedas critical.This trend indicates that, while overall vulnerabilities have increased in number, the risks andworst\-case scenarios associated with these individual vulnerabilities have decreased fromprevious years. This also indicates that, while the overall Microsoft attack surface is expandingalong with the expansion of Microsofts business, the organization is doing a better job atminimizing the most dangerous types of development errors.Microsoft has made significant investments in security improvements over the years, and webelieve this is reflected in the downward trend in the number of critical Microsoft vulnerabilities.Many of Microsofts products have had a very long tail of support, which means these securityimprovements are happening as organizations transition to more up\-to\-date and secureproducts, as well as to more SaaS instances, where everyone is kept on the latest version.As critical vulnerabilities become scarcer, attackers may need to chainmultiple, less severe exploits together to gain code execution, elevateprivileges, and move around the network.From a defenders point of view, this is a good thing because it requiresa higher level of attacker skill and reduces the number of possibleadversaries. It also provides more potential points to detect, intercept,and mitigate a breach.If an attacker needs to chain three or more vulnerabilities together to 
reach their objective, then you just need to have mitigated or patchedone of them to break the chain.132023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionVulnerabilities
Data Deep\-Dive
Vulnerabilities by CategoryRemote Code Execution andElevation of Privilege remain thetop vulnerability categories.Each Microsoft Security Bulletin is comprised of one or more vulnerabilities, 
applying to one or more Microsoft products. Microsoft typically groups 
vulnerabilities into these main categories: Remote Code Execution (RCE), 
Elevation of Privilege (EoP), Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS),Spoofing, Tampering, and Security Feature Bypass.In 2022, Elevation of Privilege and Remote Code Execution continuedElevation of Privilege vulnerabilitiesto tower over the other vulnerability categories.With that aside, Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities continue theirstrong growth trajectory, while Remote Code Execution vulnerabilitiesskyrocketed to 715 in 2022, a 22% increaseover 2021, and a whopping 689% increasesince 2017\.have been declining slightly over the past three years.Remote Code Execution continued its slightdownward trend following its 2020 peak,declining 4% in 2022 after falling 5\.5% in 2021\.Microsoft Vulnerability

categories telling us?Vulnerability levels may be changing, but hackers objectives 
remain the same, keeping emphasis on Remote Code Execution 
and Elevation of Privilege.As we discussed above, having fewer critical vulnerabilities means attackers have fewer easy paths to totallycompromise a system in one move. This is good news for organizations; however, an attackers objectiveremains unchanged: they want to get their code to run, and they want it to be able to run with enoughprivileges that they can execute their malicious intent.To achieve this objective, attackers need to have Remote Code Execution, the ability to launch their code on atarget system, and Elevation of Privilege to make sure this code runs with enough privilege. This is reflected inthe finding that Remote Code Execution and Elevation of Privilege remain the highest Microsoft vulnerabilitycategories, as highlighted in this report. In particular, the number of Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilitiesacross the Microsoft environment has been on a steep upward trajectory over the past three years.The data from this report reflects that, as of 2022, Microsoft is making continued progress at reducing thenumber of critical vulnerabilities and removing excessive privileges, especially on endpoints. This is drivingthe need for attackers to exploit Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities to succeed.162023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition2 Key 
Security Takeaways 
from the Vulnerability
Category Data12Always ensure your operating system and third\-partysoftware are up\-to\-date and you are not using end\-of\-lifesoftware in your environment.Always ensure you are removing excessive privileges,especially on endpoints.Unsurprisingly, the SANS Institutes CIS Controls, the Australian Cyber Security Centre(ACSC)s Essential 8 Cyber Risk Controls, and NISTs (SP 800\-207\) Zero Trust Architecturealso highlight these as essential cybersecurity controls for threat prevention and mitigation.See our section on Mitigating Microsoft\-Based Vulnerability Risks at the end of this reportfor more in\-depth insights.172023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionVulnerabilities

last year. 2022 figures are for Edge only.After a nearly four\-fold spikein 2021, Microsoft Edge totalvulnerabilities decreased by11%, to 311 vulnerabilities in2022; critical vulnerabilitiescontinue to plummetThose who are not familiar with what happened under the hood of Edge in recent years may be wonderingwhat on Earth happened in 2020, when critical vulnerabilities suddenly plummeted and total vulnerabilitiesrocketed. This was when Microsoft ditched their own in\-house browser engine and rebuilt Edge aroundChromium. The benefits of this move were that, going forward, Microsoft could leverage the more matureand open source Chromium engine to resolve their critical vulnerability challenges, as well as a range ofcompatibility issues that often drove customers to only use Edge onceto download the Chrome installer.The Chromium project benefits from being open source and ubiquitous enough to attract a lot of focus fromthe security research community. This focus has allowed it to rapidly mature. While other browsers may havea lower overall vulnerability count than Edge (or Chrome), this does not necessarily make them more secure.The Edge vulnerability trends are a good example of what happens when there is no easy path for an attacker.A critical vulnerability in a browser may allow an attacker to gain privileged execution on a system just byhaving the victim click a malicious link. However, with no easy path, attackers are forced to string togethermultiple less severe vulnerabilities to get from point A to point B.192023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionMicrosoft Windows Vulnerabilities

security (VBS).In 2020, the end of Windows 7 support forced users to upgrade to the Windows 10 operatingsystem, eliminating many known vulnerabilities. This accounted for the steep, 44% drop in thenumber of Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities from 2020 to 2021\.Windows 10 has been around since 2015, and Windows 11, while only launched in 2021, sharesthe same core as Windows 10\. This means the OS is less likely to introduce any major newvulnerabilities. Moreover, some security issues have been addressed by using virtualization\-based security (VBS). VBS isolates untrusted websites and Office documents from the userdata and protects key areas, such as credential stores, by providing hardware\-level isolation and 
preventing pass\-the\-hash type attacks. This helps ensure protection even in the event the OS iscompromised.While Windows total vulnerabilities increased slightly in 2022 (returning to near 2018 levels),Windows critical vulnerabilities have continued a downward trend since these changes cameinto play. We expect an overall downward trend to continue, although progress will come in smallincrements because there remains a lot of legacy code.202023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionMicrosoft Office Vulnerabilities

bumpy one in 2022\.361677520172018201920201202122022The Microsoft Office products category experienced a 45% drop in vulnerabilities in 2022,while critical vulnerabilities increased from a low of one in 2021 to two instances in 2022\.While there is an overarching downward trend in the number of Microsoft Office vulnerabilities thatstretches back five years, Office applications have remained a successful target for threat actors.This is largely due to the lag times between discovery and patching, as demonstrated by CVE\-2022\-30190 and CVE\-2022\-34713, both detailed below.Along with patching vulnerabilities, Microsoft has been pushing to cut off common attack vectors,such as VBA macros in documents, that have been delivered from the internet. This is an extremelycommon attack vector, but previous mitigation attempts have merely been soft blocks that are easilycircumvented by socially engineering the end user into enabling macros.In 2022, Microsoft stepped up defenses against this attack vector by blocking internet macros bydefault in Office applications. The block did not go as smoothly as planned. Microsoft announcedthe move in February, rolled it out in April, and temporarily rolled back the decision beforecommunicating another update about blocking VBA macros by default in the summerafterreceiving user feedback. This caused considerable confusion.So, while we have seen the trends around Microsoft Office vulnerabilities moving in the rightdirection, the road to remediation has been bumpy in 2022\. Hopefully, moving forward, we will seea condensing of the lag times between discovery and patching.212023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionMicrosoft Office

SpotlightThe Common Vulnerabilities andExposures (CVE) system providesa reference method for publiclyknown information\-securityvulnerabilities and exposures.The Follina Exploit and CVE\-2022\-30190CVSS base score of 7\.8 and temporal score of 7\.0While you can never pick a favorite vulnerability, the Follina exploit that led to Office vulnerability CVE\-2022\-30190 certainly was memorable. This was a zero\-day exploit that allowed for Remote Code Execution in Officeproducts. Notably, it leveraged the Microsoft Office protocol and MSDT, a Microsoft support tool used to allowcode to run, even if macros were disabled or when the user simply opened a preview of the file. Follina wasquickly exploited by threat actors in various attack campaigns.The timeline and response to this vulnerability was particularly interesting. As early as 2021, researchers raisedthe issue of abusing Office protocols; however, it was initially dismissed as a non\-issue. Over April and Mayof 2022, we began to see reports of these techniques being used in the wild. Other reports were submitted toMicrosoft, yet no CVE appeared until May 30th. Finally, on the 14th of June, a patch was released. However, bythis point, Qakbot and various other threat actors were actively exploiting the vulnerability.Read more about the

DogWalkwas first reported to Microsoft in late 2019, but Microsoft initially took a dismissive stance toward thepotential impact and significance of the vulnerability. This was surprising, given that the vulnerabilityallowed an attacker to gain code execution by dropping an executable file into a Windows start\-up folderwhen the victim opened a diagcab file.Because browsers did not view diagcab files as a threat, it made it possible to perform a drive\-by\-downloadand trigger the exploit just by visiting a malicious website. In turn, it also provided a way to bypass theMark of the web, where files are marked as coming from the internet and, therefore, treated with alower degree of trust (something that many security solutions monitor). Finally, DogWalk provided astraightforward way to gain both execution and persistence by launching payloads on start\-up.Only after reports surfaced of the DogWalk zero\-day being exploited in the wild, combined with fresh newsof the Follina vulnerability, did Microsoft make a U\-turn. In August of 2022, Microsoft decided this was avulnerability to patch and released a security updateWhat can we learn from DogWalk and 
Follina? The importance of proactively 
recognizing and mitigating vulnerabilities.While DogWalk was not strictly an Office vulnerability,When Microsoft initially decides somethingits worth highlighting alongside Follina because theyisnt a vulnerability, it only causes securityboth tell a story of the confusion that is caused whenresearchers and threat actors to start to pull atresearchers disclose vulnerabilities, Microsoft initiallythe threads to see what else can be unravelled.dismisses the findings, and customers becomeWell talk about this more in a later sectioncaught in the middle.on the vulnerability snowball effect.The lines between vulnerabilities, bugs, andworking as intended can become very blurred.Often, the discovery of these kinds of issues justscratches the surface of a much larger issue.The main challenge here is getting impactfulvulnerabilities recognized as such soonerand patched faster, rather than relyingon in\-the\-wild exploits and social mediapressure to drive the process.232023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionWindows Server Vulnerabilities

The number of Windows Server critical vulnerabilities has decreased by an impressive72% since 2017\.One concern with regard to Windows Server vulnerabilities is the patching coverage. The ShadowserverFoundation reported that, in late December of 2022, nearly 70,000 Microsoft Exchange Serverimplementations were still vulnerable to the ProxyNotShell vulnerabilities (CVE\-2022\-41040 \& CVE\-2022\-41082\), which were discovered in September of 2022\.As with the Windows Print Spooler vulnerabilities (detailed below), even when patched, ProxyNotShell hascontinued to cause issues. In December of 2022, researchers from CrowdStrike discovered OWASSRF, amethod for bypassing the mitigations Microsoft had provided. The OWASSRF exploit has been used by anumber of ransomware threat actors, including during the attacks on H\-Hotels and Rackspace.This situation stoked some controversy. For instance, some organizations reportedly held off patchingdue to reports of authentication errors that could have caused downtime, and due to concerns that thepatch could be bypassed anyway.

ecosystem is built on.In the case of the Windows operating system, each version has been an evolution of the previous versionnot a total rewrite. This means that, while the Windows NT kernel has evolved a long way since 1993, it hasalso brought along a lot of baggage.This is where human nature enters.

Sincethose days, Microsoft has made substantive stridesforward to improve the security of their code andsystems. Clearly, vulnerabilities remain, and as we cansee in this years report, they are hitting a record highbut we can also see where their investment in securityhas paid off, with fewer critical vulnerabilities thanever before.Looking back at the changes over the past decade,we can see that security is no longer viewed as athird\-party bolt\-on to the operating system, but assomething that should be baked in. There are lotsof technical examples of this in the latest generationsof the Windows OS, which are far more hardenedand secure by default. These architectural changesare a big factor in reducing the number of criticalvulnerabilities.But we shouldnt relax too much.There are still plenty of vulnerabilities todiscover.

Orca SecurityCOMMENTARYVulnerabilities are still the largest attack vector inthe cloud, and the findings of this years MicrosoftVulnerabilities Report reaffirm this with resoundingeffect. With a huge, 159% YoY increase in Azure andDynamics 365 vulnerabilities, companies need to bemore vigilant than ever when it comes to patching andsecurity strategies. A big part of mitigating risk beginswith least privilege this has been a significant step formany years (and still is) when it comes to cloud systemsand IoT devices.Perhaps now more than ever, organizations areunderstanding the critical need to prioritize issues basedon the potential blast radius and business impact of aIn addition, Server 1 exposes a key to an adjacentasset that contains PII. Therefore, the CVE on Server1 should be scored as high risk. On the other hand,Server 2 is an intranet server that is not publiclyaccessible and exposes no other exploitable risks.Therefore, this CVE poses a minimal threat andshould be scored as informational only.In last years Public Cloud Security Report, 78% ofidentified attack paths use known vulnerabilities(CVEs) as an initial access attack vector and, onaverage, require only three steps to reach crownjewel data. The good news is that most attackerentry points can be prevented relatively easily sincerisk. This can only be accomplished when organizationsthese CVEs are known, most have remediationshave wide visibility and contextual insight into theirenvironments. As this report demonstrates, criticalvulnerabilities carry contextual threat levels and impact, 
especially considering Microsofts unique severity ratingsystem.Ill illustrate this with the following example: Server 1 andServer 2 are both web servers that are using a vulnerablelibrary (CVE\-2018\-1176\). Without context, the risks onServer 1 and Server 2 seem to be the same. However,with access to contextual data, we see that Server 1 isInternet\-facing and easily accessible to attackers.available, and usually, only a very small percentage ofthem are externally exposed. When admin rights areremoved and identities are effectively secured, the 
decrease in risk is even more significant.With contextual insight and effective riskprioritization, cloud security teams can remediatestrategically, fix the most dangerous risks first, andwork smarter, not harder. In addition, by takingpreventive measures to reduce an attackers ability tomove laterally, such as controlling privileged access,organizations can ensure that, even if an attackerdoes gain access, the potential damage is minimizedand restricted.382023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionMitigating 
Microsoft\-Based 
Vulnerability 
RisksTimely patching is an important 
way to minimize the chance of a 
vulnerability\-related breach.Yet, with this strategy alone, organizations willstill be at risk of zero\-day exploits. In addition,patching vulnerabilities is not always practical ordesired by an organization. Thats why its crucialto have proactive security defenses, such as aleast privilege posture, in place.5 Indispensable Mitigation Strategies
for Securing Your Microsoft Environment:1234Implement vulnerability management: Find, prioritize, and determine a remediation path for all 
vulnerabilities. Keep in mind that patching sooner than later can also help you prevent a seeminglyinnocuous vulnerability from snowballing into a bigger threat.Enforce least privilege, such as by removing local admin rights: This proactive approach can provide 
highly effective protection, even in the absence of patching. Removing local admin rights, and controllingexecution, has historically mitigated 75% of Microsofts critical vulnerabilities, as we have demonstrated inpast reports where the data was available. That means that, without admin rights, the vulnerability cannotbe exploitedeven if it remains unpatched. A least privilege approach, which is also a core part of zerotrust security models, can help break multiple points in the attack chain from account hijacking to lateralmovement, to privilege escalation, and more.Follow security hardening protocols: Always ensure your operating system and third\-party software are 
up\-to\-date and you are not using end\-of\-life software in your environment. In addition, remove unneededprivileges, access, and accounts to further reduce the risk surface.Secure remote access pathways: Microsofts Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), as well as VPNs and many 
other common remote access technologies, are increasingly stretched beyond their proper use cases,resulting in security exposures and breaches. Ransomware, in particular, often uses RDP as an entrypoint. Ensure RDP is not exposed to the internet. Do not allow VPNs and BYOD to mix. Replace VPNs, oraugment them with zero trust security controls for vendor access and privileged access use cases.5Stay vigilant regarding emerging threats: Understanding the threats goes a long way toward making 
more informed decisions and keeping yourself secure. The past decade has ushered in considerablechanges in the Microsoft threat landscape, and with the rapid development and deployment of AItechnologies, we are likely to see many impactful shifts in threats over the next decade and beyond.392023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionWhen it comes to reducing the risk associated with Microsoft critical vulnerabilities,

death and taxes, vulnerabilities 
(at least where software is 
concerned) are inevitable.As the technology landscape 
continues its next phase of 
evolution, vulnerability numbers 
should continue to climb, new 
threats will continue to crawl 
out from the cyber\-ether, and 
well continue to offer our 
insights and defense tactics.In 2022, the total number of Microsoft vulnerabilities hit arecord\-high, almost quadrupling since this report began adecade ago. Microsoft Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilitieshave soared 650% across the past ten years. Over that time,new Microsoft products have driven the overall increasein total vulnerabilities, with Azure and Dynamics 365vulnerabilities climbing by 159% this last year alone.While total Microsoft vulnerabilities continue to spikesymptomatic of a growing enterprise and its expandingattack surfaceMicrosofts threat reduction initiatives anddedication to the adoption of security patches and protocolshas led to a steady, 5\-year decline of critical vulnerabilities.In 2022, only 6\.9% of Microsoft vulnerabilities were rated ascritical, compared to 44% in 2013\.Roughly a decade ago (2014\), Microsoft embarked on amobile\-first, cloud\-first strategy. At the time, this strategyrepresented a shift, but today, these are foundations of 
Microsoft, and, increasingly, enterprises around the world. Inthe decade ahead, technologies once considered speculative,such as AI, will actively be honed, productized, and embeddedacross Microsoft and everywhere. While there is muchpromise in these technologies to help both organizations andhumanity, they represent new attack surfaces and potentialthreat vectors. Vulnerabilities may emerge in ways that havenever been seen before.412023\|Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary EditionIf theres one beacon of light shining across the 
past ten years of vulnerabilities, its the fact that 
the fundamental ways to mitigate those risks have 
remained constant for well over a decade.The concepts of least privilege outlined by the US Department of Defense in 1985 are timeless. Least privilegeenforcement has proved just as relevant to the cloud systems and IoT devices of today, as it did to the legacysystems (some of which are still operational) of yester\-year.Those organizations who successfully implement proactive and preventative security controls will continue 
to be much better poised to withstand tomorrows threats, as they have been in the past decade. If there is 
one piece of advice you can take away from this report to help you secure your organization against unrelentingcyberthreats, its to keep implementing and enforcing the foundational security controls that have proventhemselves time and again against the decades greatest threats.MethodologyEvery Tuesday, Microsoft issues Patch Tuesday and releases 
security bulletins announcing fixes for any vulnerabilities affecting 
Microsoft products. The BeyondTrust Microsoft Vulnerabilities 
Report, produced annually, compiles these releases into a year\-long 
overview and analyzes the data, creating a holistic view of trends 
related to vulnerabilities.Until November 2020, Microsoft had been using their own method 
of sharing CVE details via their Security Update Guide.The former reporting format featured an executive summary 
for each reported vulnerability that would include the following 
verbiage:
Customersusers whose accounts are configured to have feweruser rights on the system could be less impacted than users who 
operate with administrative user rights.
If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an 
attacker could take control of an affected system.From this summary, security researchers could deduce whether any 
given vulnerability (specifically, the Critical ones) could have been 
mitigated had admin rights been removed from the user.In 2021, however, Microsoft shifted methodologies and moved 
to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In 2022, 
Microsoft continued to use CVSS 3\.1 scoring for their vulnerabilities, 
but began ranking severities based on Microsofts own Security 
Update Severity Rating System.The CVSS methodology allows Microsofts vulnerabilities to be 
cross\-referenced more easily with third\-party bugs, simplifyingsome analysis, and Microsofts Security Update Severity Rating 
System allows each vulnerability to be rated according to the 
worst theoretical outcome, should that vulnerability be exploited.An unfortunate trade\-off of this change, however, was the loss 
of the ability to determine the impact of admin rights on critical 
vulnerabilities.Not only do the risks of excess privileged access remain very much 
intact, but privileged attack vectors are rapidly growing with the 
expansion of the cloud.Thus, while the statistics on admin rights may be absent from 
this years report, its imperative that organizations dont get 
complacent. Removal of admin rights remains a key piece of 
applying a least privilege strategy, as well as for enabling zero trust.Accuracy of Vulnerability DataA number of generalizations have been made for each 
vulnerability, as follows:
Each vulnerability was classified with the highest severity ratingof all instances of that vulnerability where it appeared
multiple times.Each vulnerability was classified with the most prevalent typefor all instances of that vulnerability.Product versions were not taken into account.
Product combinations were not taken into account.
Vulnerabilities were counted for both the software and version 
where appropriate (for example, a vulnerability for Microsoft 
Edge on Windows 10 is taken as a vulnerability for both 
Microsoft Edge and Windows).42Additonal ResourcesFRE ETOOLPrivileged Access Discovery ApplicationUtilize the most powerful free tool available to scan your environmentand pinpoint overprivileged accounts, service accounts, unusedaccounts, privileged credentials, remote access tools, and more.TAK ET HETESTNeed a VPN Alternative?
