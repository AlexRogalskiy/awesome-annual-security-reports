and security leaders a lens into factors that can increase or help 
mitigate the rising cost of data breaches.Now in its 17th year, this research conducted independently 
by Ponemon Institute, and sponsored, analyzed and published 
by IBM Security studied 550 organizations impacted by data 
breaches that occurred between March 2021 and March 2022\. 
The breaches occurred across 17 countries and regions and in 
17 different industries.We conducted more than 3,600 interviews with individuals from 
organizations that were impacted by the data breaches. During 
the interviews, we asked questions to determine the cost to 
organizations across different activities related directly to both 
the immediate and prolonged response to the data breaches.As in previous years reports, this years data provides a view 
of how dozens of factors impact the costs that keep adding up 
after a data breach occurs. Additionally, the report examines 
root causes, short\-term and long\-term consequences of data 
breaches, and the mitigating factors and technologies that 
allowed companies to limit losses.3Whats new in the 2022 reportWith each years edition, we aim to build upon past research 
to keep up with changing technology and events. We also try 
to form a more relevant picture of the risks and strategies 
for securing data and responding to a breach, from artificial
intelligence (AI) to zero trust. Covering some of the technologies 
most companies focused on in the past year, the 2022 edition of 
this report has new analysis related to the value of the following:
 Extended detection and response (XDR) 
 The use of risk quantification techniques
 Impacts of individual technologies that contribute to azero trust security framework, such as identity and access 
management (IAM) and multifactor authentication (MFA)Furthermore, the report takes a broader look at some leading 
contributors to higher data breach costs. For the first time, the 
report looks at the effects of supply chain compromises and
the security skills gap.The report examines areas of security vulnerability from the 
cloud to critical infrastructure. And we take a deeper dive than 
past years into the impacts of ransomware and destructive 
attacks. Also studied is the phenomenon of remote work that 
continues to be a reality for many organizations past the peak
of the COVID pandemic.As companies experience more breaches and costs continue
to climb, this report can serve as a tool to help your teams
better manage risk and limit potential losses. 
The report is divided into the following five major sections:

 The studys methodology, including how costswere calculatedIBM Security and Ponemon Institute are pleased to present
the results of the 2022 Cost of a Data Breach Report.Significantly, for the first time, the research 
shows the following insights:83%of organizations studied have had more
than one data breach.60%of organizations breaches led to increases
in prices passed on to customers.79%of critical infrastructure organizations didnt 
deploy a zero trust architecture.19%of breaches occurred because of a
compromise at a business partner.45%of the breaches were cloud\-based.4Key findingsThe key findings described here are based on IBM Security 
analysis of research data compiled by Ponemon Institute.1USD 4\.35 millionAverage total cost of a data breachReaching an all\-time high, the cost of a data breach averaged 
USD 4\.35 million in 2022\. This figure represents a 2\.6%
increase from last year, when the average cost of a breach was 
USD 4\.24 million. The average cost has climbed 12\.7% from
USD3\.86 million in the 2020 report.83%Percentage of organizations that have
had more than one breachEighty\-three percent of organizations studied have experienced 
more than one data breach, and just 17% said this was their
first data breach. Sixty percent of organizations studied stated 
that they increased the price of their services or products 
because of the data breach.The average cost of a data breach for critical infrastructure 
organizations studied was USD4\.82 million USD1 million 
more than the average cost for organizations in other industries. 
Critical infrastructure organizations included those in the 
financial services, industrial, technology, energy, transportation, 
communication, healthcare, education and public sector 
industries. Twenty\-eight percent experienced a destructive or 
ransomware attack, while 17% experienced a breach because
of a business partner being compromised.Breaches at organizations with fully deployed security AI 
and automation cost USD3\.05 million less than breaches at 
organizations with no security AI and automation deployed. This 
65\.2% difference in average breach cost between USD3\.15 
million for fully deployed versus USD6\.20 million for not 
deployed represented the largest cost savings in the study. 
Companies with fully deployed security AI and automation also 
experienced on average a 74\-day shorter time to identify and 
contain the breach, known as the breach lifecycle, than those 
without security AI and automation 249 days versus 323 days. 
The use of security AI and automation jumped by nearly one\-fifth 
in two years, from 59% in 2020 to 70% in 2022\.USD 4\.82millionAverage cost of a critical infrastructure
data breachUSD 3\.05 millionAverage cost savings associated with fully
deployed security AI and automation1\.Cost amounts in this report are measured in US dollars (USD).5USD 4\.54 millionAverage cost of a ransomware attack, not
including the cost of the ransom itselfEleven percent of breaches in the study were ransomware attacks, 
an increase from 2021, when 7\.8% of breaches were ransomware, 
for a growth rate of 41%. The average cost of a ransomware 
attack went down slightly, from USD4\.62 million in 2021 to 
USD4\.54 million in 2022\. This cost was slightly higher than the 
overall average total cost of a data breach, USD4\.35 million.19%Frequency of breaches caused by stolen
or compromised credentials59%Percentage of organizations that dont
deploy zero trustUSD 1 millionAverage difference in cost where remote
work was a factor in causing the breach
versus when it wasnt a factor45%Share of breaches that occurred in the cloud6Use of stolen or compromised credentials remains the most 
common cause of a data breach. Stolen or compromised 
credentials were the primary attack vector in 19% of breaches in 
the 2022 study and also the top attack vector in the 2021 study, 
having caused 20% of breaches. Breaches caused by stolen or 
compromised credentials had an average cost of USD4\.50 million. 
These breaches had the longest lifecycle 243 days to identify 
the breach, and another 84 days to contain the breach. Phishing 
was the second most common cause of a breach at 16% and 
also the costliest, averaging USD4\.91 million in breach costs.Just 41% of organizations in the study said they deploy a 
zero trust security architecture. The other 59% percent of 
organizations that dont deploy zero trust incur an average of 
USD1 million in greater breach costs compared to those that 
do deploy. Among critical infrastructure organizations, an even 
higher percentage of 79% doesnt deploy zero trust. These 
organizations experienced on average USD5\.40 million in breach 
costs, more than USD1 million higher than the global average.When remote working was a factor in causing the breach, costs 
were an average of nearly USD1 million greater than in breaches 
where remote working wasnt a factor USD4\.99 million versus 
USD4\.02 million. Remote work\-related breaches cost on average 
about USD600,000 more compared to the global average.Forty\-five percent of breaches in the study occurred in the cloud. 
Yet breaches that happened in a hybrid cloud environment cost 
an average of USD3\.80 million, compared to USD4\.24 million 
for breaches in private clouds and USD5\.02 million for breaches 
in public clouds. The cost difference was 27\.6% between hybrid 
cloud breaches and public cloud breaches. Organizations with 
a hybrid cloud model also had shorter breach lifecycles than 
organizations that solely adopted a public or private cloud model.USD 2\.66 millionAverage cost savings associated with an
incident response (IR) team and regularly
tested IR planNearly three\-quarters of organizations in the study said they had 
an IR plan, while 63% of those organizations said they regularly 
tested the plan. Having an IR team and an IR plan that was 
regularly tested led to significant cost savings. Businesses with 
an IR team that tested its IR plan saw an average of USD2\.66 
million lower breach costs than organizations without an IR team 
and that dont test an IR plan. The difference of USD3\.26 million 
versus USD5\.92 million represents a 58% cost savings.29 daysSavings in response time for those
with extended detection and response
(XDR) technologies12 yearsConsecutive years the healthcare industry
had the highest average cost of a breachUSD 9\.44 millionAverage cost of a breach in the United States,
the highest of any countryXDR technologies were implemented by 44% of organizations. 
Those organizations with XDR technologies saw considerable 
advantages in response times. Those organizations with XDR 
deployed shortened the breach lifecycle by about a month,
on average, compared to organizations that didnt implement 
XDR. Specifically, organizations took 275 days to identify and 
contain a breach with XDR deployed versus 304 days without 
XDR deployed. This figure represents a 10% difference in 
response times.Healthcare breach costs hit a new record high. The average 
breach in healthcare increased by nearly USD1 million to reach 
USD10\.10 million. Healthcare breach costs have been the most 
expensive industry for 12 years running, increasing by 41\.6% 
since the 2020 report. Financial organizations had the second 
highest costs averaging USD5\.97 million followed by 
pharmaceuticals at USD5\.01 million, technology at USD4\.97 
million and energy at USD4\.72 million.The top five countries and regions for the highest average cost 
of a data breach were the United States at USD9\.44 million, the 
Middle East at USD7\.46 million, Canada at USD5\.64 million, the 
United Kingdom at USD5\.05 million and Germany at USD4\.85 
million. The United States has led the list for 12 years in a row. 
Meanwhile, the country with the fastest growth rate over last 
year was Brazil, a 27\.8% increase from USD 1\.08 million to 
USD1\.38 million.7Complete findingsIn this section, we provide the detailed

 Mega breaches8Global highlightsThe Cost of a Data Breach Report is a global report, comprising 
data from 17 countries and regions and 17 industries. In this 
section, we look at several key metrics at the level of global 
average, as well as comparative costs between countries and 
between industries.Figure 1: The average cost of a data breach reached
a record high in 2022\. 
The global average total cost of a data breach increased by 
USD0\.11 million to USD4\.35 million in 2022, the highest its 
been in the history of this report. The increase from USD4\.24 
million in the 2021 report to USD4\.35 million in the 2022 report 
represents a 2\.6% increase. In the last two years, the average 
total cost has increased 12\.7% from USD3\.86 million in the 
2020 report.Figure 2: The per record cost of a data breach hit
a seven\-year high. 
The global per record cost of a data breach in 2022 was 
USD164, a 1\.9% increase from USD161 in 2021\. The increase 
from USD146 in 2020 is an increase of 12\.3%. This study 
examines breaches sized between 2,200 and 102,000 records. 
Its not consistent with this research to use the per record
cost to calculate the cost of single or multiple breaches above 
102,000 records. For more information, see the Research 
methodology section.USD4\.35 millionGlobal average total cost of a data breachAverage total cost of a data breach$4\.35$4\.24$3\.86$3\.92$3\.86$3\.62$4\.50$4\.30$4\.10$4\.00$3\.90$3\.70$3\.50$3\.30$3\.10$2\.90$2\.70$2\.502016201720182019202020212022Figure 1: Measured in USD millionsAverage per record cost of a data breach$164$161$148$150$141$146$158$170$165$160$155$150$145$140$135$130$125$1202016201720182019202020212022Figure 2: Measured in USD9Average cost of a data breach by country or region\#3Canada

2021 $2\.71The United States had the highest average total cost of a data 
breach at USD9\.44 million, a 4\.3% increase of USD0\.39 million, 
up from USD9\.05 million in 2021\. Similar to last year, the Middle 
East region again had the second highest average total cost 
of a data breach, increasing from USD6\.93 million in 2021 to 
USD7\.46 million in 2022\. This average cost was an increase of 
USD0\.53 million, or 7\.6%. Canada was again the third highest 
cost country at USD5\.64 million, an increase of USD0\.24 million 
or 4\.4%. The United Kingdom climbed to number four from 
eighth out of the 17 countries or regions, surpassing Germany, 
Japan and France in the ranking. The average total cost of a 
breach in the United Kingdom was USD5\.05 million, up from 
USD4\.67 million, an increase of USD0\.38 million, or 8\.1%.Out of the 17 countries or regions studied, six Germany, 
Japan, France, South Korea, Scandinavia and Turkey saw a 
decrease in the average total cost of a data breach. Brazil, 16th 
on the list at USD1\.38 million, saw the largest relative cost 
increase, up USD0\.3 million or 27\.8%. Turkey, 17th on the list, 
saw the largest relative cost decrease, falling from USD1\.91 
million to USD1\.11 million, a decrease of USD0\.8 million or 
42%. Broad swings in currency valuations, such as occurred in 
Turkey, can play a role in cost variations from year to year1United States

12th year in a row. 
The average total cost of a breach in healthcare increased from 
USD9\.23 million in the 2021 report to USD10\.10 million in 
2022, an increase of USD0\.87 million or 9\.4%. Healthcare is one 
of the more highly regulated industries and is considered critical 
infrastructure by the US government.The top five industries by cost were unchanged in the order of 
ranking from the 2021 report. Following healthcare were the 
financial, pharmaceuticals, technology and energy industries. 
The financial industry saw an increase from USD5\.72 million 
in 2021 to USD5\.97 million in 2022, an increase of USD0\.25 
million or 4\.4%. The industrial industry, comprised of chemical, 
engineering and manufacturing organizations, saw an increase 
from USD4\.24 million to USD4\.47 million in 2022, an increase 
of USD0\.23 million or 5\.4%. The average total cost decreased
slightly in four industries pharmaceuticals, transportation, 
media and hospitality.Healthcare is one of the more 
highly regulated industries and is 
considered critical infrastructure 
by the US government.11Figure 5: Detection and escalation costs surpassed lost 
business costs as the largest of four cost categories comprising 
the cost of a data breach, for the first time in six years. 
Broken down into four cost categories lost business, detection 
and escalation, notification and post breach response the 
largest share of data breach costs in 2022 was detection and 
escalation. Detection and escalation costs increased from 
USD1\.24 million in 2021 to USD1\.44 million in 2022, an 
increase of USD0\.2 million or 16\.1%. Detection and escalation 
costs include activities that enable a company to reasonably 
detect a breach. These costs include forensic and investigative 
activities; assessment and audit services; crisis management; 
and communications to executives and boards.For the first time in at least six years, lost business, at USD1\.42 
million in 2022, wasnt the largest share of data breach costs. Lost 
business costs decreased from USD1\.59 million in 2021, a decrease 
of 10\.7%. Lost business costs include activities that attempt to 
minimize the loss of customers, business disruption and revenue 
losses. These costs include business disruption and revenue losses 
from system downtime; cost of lost customers and acquiring new 
customers; and reputation losses and diminished goodwill.Notification costs and post breach response costs remained 
relatively unchanged from 2021 to 2022\. See How we calculate 
the cost of a data breach in the Research methodology 
section for definitions of each of the four cost categories.Average cost of a data breach divided into four segments$4\.50$4\.00$3\.50$3\.00$0\.19$0\.93$2\.50$0\.99$2\.00$1\.50$1\.51$1\.00$0\.50$0\.002017$0\.16$1\.02$0\.21$1\.07$0\.24$0\.99$0\.27$1\.14$0\.31$1\.18$1\.23$1\.22$1\.11$1\.24$1\.44$1\.45$1\.42$1\.52$1\.59$1\.4220182019202020212022NotificationPost breach responseDetection and escalationLost business costFigure 5: Measured in USD millions12Was this your first data breach?Yes17%No83%Figure 6Figure 6: Most organizations in the study have experienced
more than one data breach. 
Of the 550 organizations in the study, just 17% said this was 
their first data breach. Eighty\-three percent said this wasnt their 
first data breach. With security teams handling more incidents 
every year and considering the impact of remote work on 
security, its likely the recurrence of breaches is climbing.Figure 7: A majority of organizations in the study said they
increased the price of their products and services as a result
of the data breach. 
In response to the question, 60% said they increased prices,
and 40% said they didnt increase prices.13Did the data breach result in your 
organization increasing the price of 
products and services?Yes
60%No
40%Figure 7Data breach lifecycleThe time elapsed between the first detection of the breach 
and its containment is referred to as the data breach lifecycle. 
The time to identify a breach describes the time it takes to 
detect that an incident has occurred. The time to contain a 
breach refers to the time it takes for an organization to resolve a 
situation when its been detected and ultimately restore service. 
These metrics can be used to determine the effectiveness of an 
organizations incident response and containment processes.Figure 8: The mean or average time to identify and contain
a data breach fell from 287 days in 2021 to 277 days
in 2022, a decrease of 10 days or 3\.5%. 
In 2022 it took an average of 207 days to identify the breach and 
70 days to contain the breach. In 2021 it took an average of 212 
days to identify the breach and 75 days to contain the breach. 
The 277\-day average in 2022 means that if a breach occurred on 
January 1, it would take until October 4 of that year to identify 
and contain the breach. The 277\-day average is consistent 
with the average over the past seven years, with a maximum 
difference of 11% between the lowest total, 257 days in 2017, 
and the highest total, 287 days in 2021\.Average time to identify and contain a data breach202220212020201920182017201620721220720619719120170757373696670277287280279266257271050100150200250300Mean time to identifyMean time to containFigure 8: Measured in days277 daysAverage time to identify and contain
a data breach14Figure 9: A shorter data breach lifecycle continues to be
associated with lower data breach costs. 
A data breach lifecycle of less than 200 days was associated 
with an average cost of USD3\.74 million in 2022, compared to 
USD4\.86 million for breaches with a lifecycle of greater than 
200 days. This difference represents an average cost savings
of USD1\.12 million, or 26\.5%, for breaches with the shorter
than 200\-day lifecycle.The cost gap between a lifecycle longer than 200 days and a 
lifecycle shorter than 200 days was smaller in 2022 than in 
2021, when it was USD1\.26 million. The cost gap in 2022 
USD1\.12 million is the same size as the cost gap in 2020\. The 
cost gap has grown slightly over the past seven years, while the 
average cost of a data breach has also grown incrementally. The 
2021 cost gap of USD1\.26 million was the largest of the past 
seven years.Average cost of a data breach based on data breach lifecycle$4\.56$4\.33$4\.15$4\.87$4\.86$3\.61$3\.75$3\.61$3\.74$3\.21$3\.34$3\.21$2\.79$2\.54$6\.00$5\.00$4\.00$3\.00$2\.00$1\.00$0\.002016201720182019202020212022Lifecycle \< 200 daysLifecycle \> 200 daysFigure 9: Measured in USD millions.

regulatory environments, such as the healthcare, financial, 
energy, pharmaceuticals and education industries, tended to 
see costs accrue in later years following the breach. 
The difference between low and high regulatory environments 
showed up in a pronounced way two years or more after the data 
breach the longtail costs. In highly regulated industries, an 
average of 24% of data breach costs were accrued more than 
two years after the breach occurred. This result compares to 
an average of 8% of costs accrued more than two years after a 
breach in low regulatory environments.In low regulatory environments, data breach costs tended to 
accrue in the first three to six months where an average of 
24% of data breach costs accrued. In the overall average for 
2022, 52% of costs were incurred in the first 12 months, 29% in 
the second year after the breach and 19% more than two years 
after the breach. For highly regulated industries, 45% of costs 
accrued in the first year, 31% in the second year and 24% more 
than two years after the breach.In the analysis of industries in the high regulation categories, we 
concluded that regulatory and legal costs may have contributed 
to higher costs in the years following a breach.Note: This analysis was comprised of a subset of 218 companies

initial attack vectorInitial attack vectorsThis section looks at the prevalence and cost of initial attack 
vectors of data breaches. The breaches in the study are divided 
into 10 initial attack vectors, ranging from accidental data loss 
and cloud misconfiguration to phishing, insider threats and 
stolen or compromised credentials. This section also compares 
the average time it takes to identify and contain breaches based 
on their initial attack vector.Figure 11: The most common initial attack vector in 2022
was stolen or compromised credentials, responsible for 19% of 
breaches in the study, at an average cost of USD4\.50 million.
In 2022, the most common initial attack vectors were 
compromised credentials at 19% of breaches, phishing at
16% of breaches, cloud misconfiguration at 15% of breaches 
and vulnerability in third\-party software at 13% of breaches.
The 2021 report saw the same order of the top four initial
attack vectors.The costliest initial attack vector in 2022 on average was 
phishing at USD4\.91 million. Following phishing was business 
email compromise at USD4\.89 million and 6% of breaches, 
vulnerability in third\-party software at USD4\.55 million and 
compromised credentials at USD4\.50 million.Average cost and frequency of data breaches by initial attack vectorBusiness email compromise

with high levels of compliance failuresKey cost factorsThis section looks at a multitude of factors that influence 
the cost of a data breach, including various types of security 
technologies and practices. A special analysis of 28 cost factors 
examines their impact on the mean cost of a data breach. We 
look at how these 28 factors were associated with either lower\-
than\-average breach costs stemming from a cost mitigating 
influence, or a higher\-than\-average cost of a breach resulting 
from a cost amplifying influence.The following cost factors are new to the report this year: IAM; 
XDR technologies; MFA; and crisis management teams.These cost factors arent additive, so its not consistent with this 
research to add multiple cost factors together to calculate the 
cost of a breach.19Figure 13 shows the impact of 28 factors on the average
cost of a data breach. 
The chart shows the average cost difference of breaches at 
organizations with these cost\-influencing factors compared to 
the mean cost of a data breach of USD4\.35 million. The chart is 
divided into those factors that are associated with a lower\- 
than\-average breach cost, which are cost mitigators, and those 
factors that are associated with a higher\-than\-average breach 
cost, or cost amplifiers.AI platforms, a DevSecOps approach and use of an incident 
response (IR) team were the three factors associated with the 
highest cost decrease compared to the mean cost of a breach. 
For example, breaches at organizations with AI platforms had 
an average cost that was USD300,075 less than the mean cost 
of a data breach of USD4\.35 million which is approximately 
USD4\.05 million.On the other hand, security system complexity, occurrence 
of cloud migration when the organization is in the process of 
migrating to the cloud and compliance failures were the three 
factors associated with the highest net increase in the average 
cost. For example, breaches at organizations with security 
system complexity had an average cost of USD290,655 more 
than the mean cost of a data breach of USD4\.35 million 
which is approximately USD4\.64 million.For the first time, this years report measured the impact of 
the following four new cost factors: IAM; XDR technologies; 
MFA; and crisis management teams. Each of these factors was 
associated with lower\-than\-average breach costs, led by IAM.Impact of key factors on the average total cost of a data breach\-$300,075

 with the greatest level of impact in potentially amplifying 
the average cost of a data breach. 
This chart compares organizations with a high level of the cost 
factor to those with a low level of the cost factor. There was a 
difference of USD2\.47 million, or 58%, between high levels 
and low levels of security system complexity. A difference of 
USD2\.27 million, or 50\.5%, occurred between high levels 
and low levels of cloud migration. There was a difference of 
USD2\.26 million, or 50\.9%, between high levels and low levels 
of compliance failures. These data points showed that having 
high levels of these cost factors present was also associated 
with a significantly higher than average cost of a data breach. 
Organizations with a high level of cloud migration had a USD5\.63 
million average cost that was USD1\.28 million higher than the 
average cost of a data breach, a difference of 25\.7%.Figure 15 looks at the three cost factors out of 28 measured 
 with the greatest level of impact in potentially mitigating the 
cost of a data breach. 
The chart compares organizations with a high level of the 
cost factor to those with a low level of the cost factor. Those 
organizations with high levels of use of security platforms that 
use AI had an average cost of a breach that was USD2\.39 
million, or 55\.3%, lower than those with low levels of use of an 
AI platform. Organizations with high levels of use of an IR team 
had an average cost of a breach that was USD2\.12 million, or

Those organizations with a high level of use of a DevSecOps 
approach had an average cost of a breach that was USD1\.17

security AI and automationSecurity AI and automationThis was the fifth year we examined the relationship between 
data breach cost and security AI and automation. In this 
context, security AI and automation refers to enabling security 
technologies that augment or replace human intervention in 
the identification and containment of incidents and intrusion 
attempts. Such technologies depend upon AI, machine learning, 
analytics and automated security orchestration.On the opposite end of the spectrum are processes driven 
by manual inputs, often across dozens of tools and complex, 
nonintegrated systems, without data shared between them.Figure 16: The share of organizations with fully or
partially deployed security AI and automation increased
by five percentage points, from 65% to 70%, between
2021 and 2022\.
Fully deployed security AI and automation increased by six 
percentage points, from 25% to 31%, between 2021 and 2022 
and by 10 percentage points, from 21% to 31%, between 2020 
and 2022\. The share of organizations with no security AI and 
automation deployed decreased from 35% in 2021 to 30% in 
2022 and has decreased from 41% in 2020, a difference of 11 
percentage points.State of security AI and automation comparing three

Organizations with fully deployed security AI and automation 
had an average total cost of a data breach of USD3\.15 million. 
This average total cost compared to USD6\.20 million for 
organizations without security AI and automation deployed. The 
difference between average cost of a breach with fully deployed

Organizations with fully deployed security AI and automation 
took an average of 181 days to identify and 68 days to contain 
the data breach, for a total lifecycle of 249 days. Those 
organizations with no security AI and automation deployed took 
an average 235 days to identify and 88 days to contain a breach, 
for a total lifecycle of 323 days, which was 74 days longer than 
organizations with fully deployed security AI and automation. 
The average time to identify and contain a breach was a total of 
299 days with partially deployed security AI and automation.24248829 daysOrganizations with XDR technologies identified 
and contained a breach 29 days faster than 
those without XDRIs your organization implementing XDR technologies?Yes
44%XDR technologiesFor the first time, the study examined the effects of XDR 
technologies on the cost of a data breach. This section looks
at the prevalence of XDR in the organizations studied,
plus its impact on average total cost and the average time
to contain data breaches.Significantly, XDR impacted average breach costs with a savings 
of 9\.2%. While these savings may appear humble at first sight, 
the true impact comes in the amount of time organizations saved 
in breach duration when they use XDR nearly one month. Extra 
time to identify and contain a breach can add a lot to the overall 
cost of a breach and its consequences.Figure 19: XDR capabilities were commonly used
but not yet by a majority of organizations. 
According to the survey of 550 organizations in the study, 
44% are implementing XDR technologies, while 56% arent 
implementing XDR technologies.No
56%Figure 1925Figure 20: The use of XDR technologies was associated with
a lower\-than\-average cost of a data breach. 
Those organizations that are implementing XDR technologies 
experienced an average cost of a data breach of USD4\.15 
million. Organizations that werent implementing XDR 
technologies experienced an average cost of a data breach 
of USD4\.55 million. This cost was above the global average 
and USD0\.40 million more than breaches at organizations 
implementing XDR technologies, a difference of 9\.2%.Figure 21: The average time to identify and contain a data 
breach was significantly lower with XDR technologies. 
Breaches at organizations with XDR technologies deployed
took an average of 275 days to identify and contain the breach, 
which was 29 days less than breaches at organizations without 
XDR technologies deployed, at 304 days. That represents a
10% difference in mean time to identify and contain a breach 
between organizations with XDR technologies and those with
no XDR technologies.Impact of XDR technologies on average cost

again looked at how IR teams, capabilities and processes 
impacted the cost of a breach.Figure 22: A majority of organizations in the study had

Nearly three\-quarters of organizations in the study said they
had an IR plan, with 73% saying they did have an IR plan and

The gap between the average data breach cost at organizations 
with both IR teams and IR plan testing and those with neither IR 
teams or IR plan testing continued to grow between the 2020 
report and the 2022 report. Breaches at organizations with IR 
capabilities saw an average cost of a breach of USD3\.26 million 
in 2022, compared to USD5\.92 million at organizations without 
IR capabilities. This average cost was a difference of USD2\.66 
million, or 58%. Those savings were an increase over 2021, 
when the average cost of a breach at organizations with IR 
capabilities saved USD2\.46 million, and in 2020, when the cost 
difference was USD1\.77 million. This finding indicates a growing 
cost\-saving effectiveness of IR capabilities.28USD2\.10 millionCost savings of breaches at organizations
that use risk quantification techniques
versus those that dontDoes your organization prioritize risks, threats and 
impacts based on risk quantification techniques?Yes
47%Risk quantificationRisk quantification looks at impacts, including financial impacts, 
availability of data and data integrity. Using risk quantification 
can highlight financial loss types by impact, including the 
following examples: loss of productivity; cost of response or 
recovery; reputation impact; and fines and judgments.Chief information security officers (CISOs), risk managers and 
security teams can use benchmark research like the Cost of a 
Data Breach Report to infer general trends and cost averages in 
their industry or geography. However, using data specific to the 
organization, rather than industry averages, can clarify potential 
security gaps and how to reduce overall risk by quantifying 
security risk into financial terms.This section looks at how many organizations are using risk 
quantification techniques to prioritize risks, threats and impacts 
and reviews the average cost impact of risk quantification 
techniques.Figure 24: Less than half, 47%, said they prioritize risks, 
threats and impacts based on risk quantification techniques. 
Meanwhile, out of the 550 organizations studied, 53% dont 
prioritize risks, threats and impacts based on risk quantification 
techniques.Figure 25: Risk quantification had a considerable effect on 
data breach costs, saving up to USD2\.10 million on average. 
Organizations that prioritized risks, threats and impacts based 
on risk quantification techniques had an average breach cost of 
USD3\.30 million. That cost was USD2\.10 million less than those 
that didnt use risk quantification, at USD5\.40 million, a savings 
of 48\.3%. Risk quantification was associated with breach costs 
that were more than USD1 million lower than the global average

early adoption of zero trustHas your organization deployed a zero trust 
 security architecture?Yes
41%Zero trustFor a second year, this study examined the prevalence and 
financial impact of data breaches based on deployment of a zero 
trust security framework. The zero trust approach operates on 
the assumption that user identities or the network itself may 
already be compromised, and instead relies on AI and analytics 
to continuously validate connections between users, data and 
resources. As the data in this section shows, zero trust has a net 
positive impact on data breach costs.Figure 26: In the 2022 study, 41% of organizations
said they have deployed a zero trust security architecture, 
while 59% said they havent. 
This finding compares to the 2021 report when 35% said they 
had partially or fully deployed a zero trust architecture.No
59%Figure 2630Figure 27: Organizations with zero trust deployed saved
nearly USD1 million in average breach costs compared to 
organizations without zero trust deployed. 
The average cost of a data breach was USD4\.15 million at 
organizations with zero trust deployed, while the cost of a breach 
was an average USD5\.10 million at organizations without zero 
trust deployed. The difference was USD0\.95 million, representing 
a 20\.5% savings for organizations with zero trust deployed.Figure 28: Having a mature zero trust deployment was 
associated with breach costs that were more than
USD1\.5 million lower than breaches at organizations with
early adoption of zero trust. 
Organizations with mature stage deployment of their zero trust 
security architecture, when zero trust is applied consistently 
across all domains, had an average data breach cost of USD3\.45 
million. In midstage, when zero trust was applied in many
areas of the organization, the average cost of a data breach
was USD3\.96 million. For early adoption stage organizations 
that were beginning to implement a few practices, the average
cost of a data breach was USD4\.96 million. This cost was 
USD1\.51 million more than breaches at mature organizations,
a difference of 35\.9%.Impact of zero trust on average cost of a data breach$5\.10$4\.15$6\.00$5\.00$4\.00$3\.00$2\.00$1\.00$0\.00Zero trust

ransomware and breaches. We also added destructive malware 
breaches to this years study. Compared to last year, ransomware 
breach costs have declined slightly, from USD4\.62 million 
to USD4\.54 million. However, the frequency of ransomware 
breaches has increased from 7\.8% of breaches in the 2021 
report to 11% in the 2022 study.This year we looked at the lifecycle of these breaches, as well as 
what impact paying a ransom had on the non\-ransom cost of the 
breach. Note: This study doesnt include the cost of the ransom 
itself in calculating the cost of a ransomware attack.Figure 29: Ransomware was responsible for 11% of breaches, 
while destructive attacks were responsible for 17% of 
breaches. 
Another 19% of breaches were caused by supply chain attacks, 
which were breaches caused due to a business partner being 
initially compromised. Human errors, meaning breaches caused 
unintentionally through negligent actions of employees or 
contractors, were responsible for 21% of breaches.IT failures, which were caused by a disruption or failure in 
an organizations computer systems that led to data loss, 
were responsible for 24% of breaches. Such failures included 
errors in source code, or a process failure such as automated 
communication errors. The remaining 8% of breaches were
other malicious attacks.Figure 30: The average cost of a ransomware attack 
not including the cost of the ransom itself was USD4\.54 
million, slightly higher than the overall average total cost
of a data breach of USD4\.35 million. 
The average cost of a destructive or wiper attack was USD5\.12 
million, which was USD0\.77 million more than the overall 
average, a difference of 16\.3%.49 daysRansomware breaches took 49 days longer

lifecycle of 324 days. Compared to the overall average lifecycle 
of 277 days, organizations took 49 days longer to identify

The cost of the ransom wasnt included in the calculation of 
the cost of a ransomware breach.A ransomware breachs cost 
was based on activities, such as detection of the attack and loss 
of business due to system downtime. For those organizations 
that didnt pay the ransom, the average cost of the breach was 
USD5\.12 million. For organizations that did pay the ransom, 
the cost of the breach was USD4\.49 million. The difference in

in recent years, this years report marked the first year that 
we examined data breaches in the context of supply chain 
attacks. A supply chain compromise is a breach resulting from 
a compromise of a business partner such as a supplier. As the 
research found, nearly one\-fifth of breaches were caused by 
a supply chain compromise, and these compromises made 
breaches more expensive and resulted in longer lifecycles.Figure 33: About one\-fifth of breaches in the study were the 
result of a supply chain compromise. 
Nineteen percent of organizations said yes, they were breached 
as a result of a supply chain compromise, and 81% said no.Figure 34: The average total cost of a supply chain
compromise was USD4\.46 million. 
That cost was greater than the overall average cost of a data 
breach of USD4\.35 million, a difference of USD0\.11 million
or 2\.5%.26 daysA supply chain breach took on average

to contain a supply chain compromise, for a total lifecycle of 303 
days. The average lifecycle was 26 days longer than the overall 
average data breach lifecycle of 277 days, a difference of 9%.35Critical infrastructureThis report marked the first year that we studied the cost 
and containment of data breaches in the context of critical 
infrastructure industries. Based on classification by the US 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), critical 
infrastructure industries in this study included financial services, 
industrial, technology, energy, transportation, communication, 
healthcare, education and public sector.One revelation of this analysis was that critical infrastructure 
industries had a much lower prevalence of zero trust security 
approaches than the global average. Critical infrastructure 
industries without zero trust strategies deployed had 
significantly higher data breach costs than average.Figure 36: Ransomware and destructive attacks were 
responsible for more than a quarter of breaches in critical 
infrastructure industries. 
Ransomware attacks accounted for 12% of critical infrastructure 
breaches, while destructive attacks were behind 16% of critical 
infrastructure breaches, for a combined 28%. Another 17% of 
breaches on these industries were supply chain attacks where a

breaches caused by human error or IT failures accounted 
for 22% and 25%, respectively. The remaining 8% of critical 
infrastructure breaches were other malicious attacks.79%Share of critical infrastructure industries that

days for other industries. The mean time to contain for critical 
infrastructure industries was 69 days, compared to 71 days for 
other industries. The combined average of 273 days to identify

to safeguard their cloud environmentsCloud breaches and cloud modelFor a second year in this report, weve taken a close look at the 
impact of cloud model and maturity of cloud security on the 
cost of a data breach. The research found that 45% of breaches 
occurred in the cloud, but those in the public cloud cost 
considerably more than breaches at organizations with a hybrid 
cloud model. However, analysis of the research also shows 
that organizations still need a mature cloud security posture, 
regardless of cloud model.Figure 41: A plurality of study participants had a
hybrid cloud IT operating model, with 45% indicating
they had a hybrid cloud model. 
Meanwhile, 28% said their IT model was fully on\-premises,
and 27% said their IT model was completely cloud\-based.Figure 42: Nearly half of organizations experienced
a data breach in the cloud.

their cloud environments. 
Meanwhile, 34% were at the midstage and were applying 
many cloud security practices, and 23% were in the mature 
stage and were applying security practices consistently 
across all domains. Another 26% of organizations said that 
they were in the early stage, meaning that they had begun 
applying a few cloud security practices. Finally, 17% of 
organizations said that they had not started their journey in 
securing their cloud environments.40Figure 44: Organizations with mature cloud security had a 
lower\-than\-average cost of a data breach. 
At mature organizations, breach costs were on average 
USD0\.66 million less than organizations in the early stages of 
securing their cloud environments. Breaches at mature\-stage 
organizations cost an average of USD3\.87 million, compared to 
USD4\.39 million at midstage organizations, USD4\.53 million at 
early\-stage organizations and USD4\.59 million at organizations 
that had not started their cloud security journey. The cost 
difference between mature stage and early stage represented 
a 15\.7% savings for mature stage organizations. Note: Breach 
costs in this analysis refer to any type of breach, not just cloud\-
based breaches.Figure 45: Organizations in the mature stage of securing their 
cloud environments were able to identify and contain the data 
breach much more quickly than organizations in the early stage. 
Mature stage organizations took an average of 176 days to 
identify and 61 days to contain a breach, or 237 days combined. 
This lifecycle was 40 days less than the global average of 277 
days and 64 days less than early\-stage organizations more 
than two months, or a 23\.8% difference. Those organizations 
who had not started their cloud security journey took much 
longer to identify and contain the breach. The average for those 
organizations was 345 days, more than 100 days longer than 
mature\-stage organizations. For midstage organizations, the 
average time to identify and contain the data breach was 277 
days, the same as the overall global average.Average cost of a data breach by cloud security

The average time to identify and contain a breach with a hybrid 
cloud model was 262 days. This lifecycle was 15 days less than 
the global average of 277 days and eight days less than private 
cloud. Breaches at organizations with a public cloud model took 
an average of 310 days to identify and contain the breach. This 
lifecycle was 48 days longer than hybrid cloud, or a difference 
of 16\.8%. Note: Since hybrid cloud implementations vary, this 
analysis included on\-premises breaches, not just purely cloud\-
based breaches.43Remote workThis is the third time this report has been published since the 
start of the COVID\-19 pandemic. In the context of the pandemic, 
starting with last years report, weve examined the impacts of 
work\-from\-home arrangements on data breach costs. Remote 
working has had considerable effects on the cost of a breach 
when remote work was a factor in causing the breach, such as a 
remote\-working employee having credentials stolen. The study 
also found that breach costs were highest for organizations with 
most of their employees working remotely.Figure 49: There was a strong correlation between
remote working and cost of a data breach, where more 
employees working remotely was associated with
higher data breach costs. 
For those organizations with the largest share of employees 
working remotely 81% to 100% the average cost of a data 
breach was USD5\.10 million. That cost was a slight decrease in 
this category from last year. For organizations with the smallest 
share of employees working remotely less than 20% the 
average cost was USD3\.99 million. The difference between 
highest and lowest share of employees working remotely was 
USD1\.11 million, a difference of 24\.4%.Figure 50: The average total cost of a data breach was
nearly USD1 million greater when remote work was a factor
in causing the data breach. 
Organizations that indicated remote work was a factor in the 
breach experienced an average cost of a data breach of USD4\.99 
million. In contrast, the average cost of a data breach was 
USD4\.02 million when remote work wasnt a factor in causing 
the breach, a difference of USD0\.97 million or 21\.5%. When 
remote work was a factor, the cost was also USD0\.64 million 
more than the overall global average, a difference of 13\.7%.USD1 millionBreach costs where remote working

teams. Those organizations that said they were sufficiently 
staffed saw considerable cost savings in terms of data breach 
costs, compared to those without enough employees to staff 
their teams. This was the first year of this report that we took a 
deeper look at the security skills gap.Figure 51: There was a widespread security skills
shortage among organizations in the study. 
Only a little more than one\-third of organizations had
sufficiently staffed security teams. Just 38% of organizations 
said their security teams were sufficiently staffed to meet their 
security management needs, while 62% said they werent 
sufficiently staffed.Figure 52: Organizations that said their security
teams had a skills shortage had a higher\-than\-average
cost of the data breach. 
At organizations with a sufficiently staffed security team, the 
average cost of a data breach was lower than average. The 
average cost of a data breach at sufficiently staffed organizations 
was USD4\.01 million. In contrast, the average cost of a data 
breach was USD4\.56 million at organizations with insufficiently 
staffed security teams, a difference of USD0\.55 million, or 12\.8%.USD550,000Average data breach cost savings of a

But mega breaches have an outsized impact on consumers
and industries.This study included 13 companies that experienced a data 
breach involving the loss or theft of 1 million to 60 million 
records. The study of the mega breaches involved a distinct 
methodology from the other 550 breaches in this study, each 
of which had no more than 102,000 lost records. For a full 
explanation of the research methodology, see the Data breach 
FAQ at the end of this report.Average cost of a mega breach by number of records lost$401$392$387$381$379$364$318$316$311$241$230$220$184$180$176$450$400$350$300$250$200$150$100$50$0$50$52$491M10M10M20M20M30M30M40M40M50M50M60M202020212022Figure 53: Measured in USD millionsFigure 53: In 2022, the average cost of a mega breach 
decreased slightly.
Mega breach costs saw a decrease from 2021 in six of seven 
breach size cohorts. The cost of the largest mega breaches of
50 million to 60 million records decreased from USD401 million
in 2021 to USD387 million, a drop of USD14 million or 3\.6%. The 
cohort for 20 million to 30 million records was the only cohort 
where the average increased from last year. In that cohort, the 
average total cost of a mega breach increased from USD230 
million to USD241million, an increase of USD11 million or 4\.8%.46Recommendations to 
help minimize financial 
impacts of a data breachIn this section, IBM Security outlines steps organizations can take 
to help reduce the financial cost and reputational consequences 
of a data breach. These recommendations include successful 
security approaches taken by organizations in the study.Adopt a zero trust security model to help prevent unauthorized 
access to sensitive data. 
Results from the study showed that while just 41% of 
organizations had implemented a zero trust security approach, 
they had a potential breach cost saving of USD1\.5 million with a 
mature deployment. As organizations incorporate remote work 
and hybrid multicloud environments, a zero trust strategy can 
help protect data and resources by limiting their accessibility and 
requiring context.Security tools that can share data between disparate systems 
and centralize data security operations can help security 
teams detect incidents across complex hybrid multicloud 
environments. You can gain deeper insights, mitigate risks and 
accelerate response with an open security platform that can 
advance your zero trust strategy. At the same time, you can use 
your existing investments while leaving your data where it is, 
helping your team become more efficient and collaborative.47Create and test incident response playbooks to increase
cyber resilience. 
Two of the most effective ways to mitigate the cost of a data 
breach are forming an incident response (IR) team and extensive 
testing of the IR plan. Breaches at organizations with IR teams 
that regularly test their plan saw USD2\.66 million in savings 
compared to breaches at organizations with no IR team or 
testing of the IR plan. Organizations can respond quickly to 
contain the fallout from a breach by establishing a detailed 
cyberincident playbook. Routinely test that plan through tabletop 
exercises or run a breach scenario in a simulated environment 
such as a cyber range.Adversary simulation exercises, also known as red team 
exercises, can enhance the effectiveness of IR teams by 
uncovering attack paths and techniques they might miss and 
identifying gaps in their detection and response capabilities. 
An attack surface management solution can help organizations 
improve their security posture by locating previously unknown 
exposure points through simulations of an authentic attack 
experience.Recommendations for security practices are for educational 
purposes and dont guarantee results.Protect sensitive data in cloud environments using policy
and encryption. 
With the increasing amount and value of data being hosted in 
cloud environments, organizations should take steps to protect 
cloud\-hosted databases. Mature cloud security practices were 
associated with breach cost savings of USD720,000 compared 
to no cloud security practices. Use data classification schema 
and retention programs to help bring visibility into and reduce 
the volume of sensitive information thats vulnerable to a breach. 
Protect sensitive information using data encryption and fully 
homomorphic encryption. Using an internal framework for audits, 
evaluating risk across the enterprise and tracking compliance 
with governance requirements can help improve your ability to 
detect a data breach and escalate containment efforts.Invest in security orchestration, automation and response 
(SOAR) and XDR to help improve detection and response times. 
Along with security AI and automation, XDR capabilities can 
help significantly reduce average data breach costs and breach 
lifecycles. According to the study, organizations with XDR 
deployed shortened the breach lifecycle by 29 days on average 
compared to organizations that didnt implement XDR, with a 
cost savings of USD400,000\. SOAR and security information and 
event management (SIEM) software, managed detection and 
response services and XDR can help your organization accelerate 
incident response with automation, process standardization and 
integration with your existing security tools.Use tools that help protect and monitor endpoints and
remote employees. 
In the study, breaches where remote work was a factor in 
causing the breach cost nearly USD1 million more than 
breaches where remote work wasnt a factor. Unified endpoint 
management (UEM), endpoint detection and response (EDR) 
and identity and access management (IAM) products and 
services can help provide security teams with deeper visibility 
into suspicious activity. This oversight involves bring your own 
devices (BYOD) and company laptops, desktops, tablets, mobile 
devices and IoT, including endpoints the organization doesnt 
have physical access to. UEM, EDR and IAM speed investigation 
and response time to isolate and contain the damage in breaches 
where remote work was a factor.48Organization

capture any company\-specific information. Data collection 
methods excluded actual accounting information and instead 
relied upon participants estimating direct costs by marking a 
range variable on a number line. Participants were instructed to 
mark the number line in one spot between the lower and upper 
limits of a range for each cost category.The numerical value obtained from the number line, rather than 
a point estimate for each presented cost category, preserved 
confidentiality and ensured a higher response rate. The 
benchmark instrument also required respondents to provide a 
second estimate for indirect and opportunity costs, separately.To ensure a manageable size for benchmarking, we carefully 
limited items to only cost activity centers that we considered 
crucial to measuring data breach costs. Based on discussions 
with experts, the final set of items included a fixed set of 
cost activities. After collecting benchmark information, we 
re\-examined each instrument carefully for consistency and 
completeness.We limited the scope of data breach cost items to known cost 
categories that applied to a broad set of business operations that 
handle personal information. Our belief was that a study focused 
on business process not data protection or privacy compliance 
activities would yield better quality results.53How we calculate the cost 
of a data breachTo calculate the average cost of a data breach, this research 
excluded very small and very large breaches. Data breaches 
examined in the 2022 study ranged in size between 2,200 and 
102,000 compromised records. We used a separate analysis 
to examine the costs of very large mega breaches, which is 
explained further in the Data breach FAQ section of the report.This research used activity\-based costing, which identifies 
activities and assigns a cost according to actual use. Four 
process\-related activities drive a range of expenditures 
associated with an organizations data breach: detection and 
escalation, notification, post breach response and lost business.Detection and escalation 
Activities that enable a company to reasonably detect the 
breach, including the following: 
 Forensic and investigative activities 
 Assessment and audit services 
 Crisis management 
 Communications to executives and boardsNotification
Activities that enable the company to notify data subjects, data 
protection regulators and other third parties, including the 
following:
 Emails, letters, outbound calls or general notice to datasubjects Determination of regulatory requirements
 Communication with regulators
 Engagement of outside expertsPost breach response
Activities to help victims of a breach communicate with the 
company and redress activities to victims and regulators, 
including the following:
 Help desk and inbound communications
 Credit monitoring and identity protection services
 Issuing new accounts or credit cards
 Legal expenditures
 Product discounts
 Regulatory finesLost business
Activities that attempt to minimize the loss of customers, 
business disruption and revenue losses, including the following:
 Business disruption and revenue losses from systemdowntime Cost of losing customers and acquiring new customers
 Reputation losses and diminished goodwillThis research used activity\-based 
costing, which identifies activities 
and assigns a cost according to 
actual use.54Can the average per record cost be used to calculate the cost 
of breaches involving millions of lost or stolen records? 
The average cost of data breaches in our research doesnt apply 
to catastrophic or mega data breaches, such as Equifax, Capital 
One or Facebook. These events arent typical of the breaches 
many organizations experience. To draw useful conclusions in 
understanding data breach cost behaviors, we targeted data 
breach incidents that didnt exceed 102,000 records.Its not consistent with this research to use the per record cost
to calculate the cost of single or multiple breaches totaling 
millions of records. However, the study uses a simulation 
framework for measuring the cost impact of a mega breach 
involving 1 million or more records, based on a sample of 13 very 
large breaches of this size.Why did you use simulation methods to estimate the cost of
a mega data breach? 
The sample size of 13 companies that experienced a mega 
breach was too small to perform a statistically significant 
analysis using activity\-based cost methods. To remedy this issue, 
we deployed Monte Carlo simulation to estimate a range of 
possible, meaning random, outcomes through repeated trials.In total, we performed more than 150,000 trials. The grand 
mean of all sample means provided a most likely outcome at 
each size of data breach, ranging from 1 million to 60 million 
compromised records.Are you tracking the same organizations each year? 
Each annual study involves a different sample of companies. 
To be consistent with previous reports, we recruit and match 
companies each year with similar characteristics such as the 
companys industry, headcount, geographic footprint and size 
of data breach. Since starting this research in 2005, we have 
studied the data breach experiences of 5,027 organizations.Data breach FAQWhat is a data breach? 
A breach is defined as an event in which an individuals name 
and a medical record, a financial record or both, or debit card 
are potentially put at risk. These records can be in electronic or 
paper format. Breaches included in the study ranged from 2,200 
to 102,000 compromised records.What is a compromised record? 
A record is information that identifies the natural person or 
individual whose information has been lost or stolen in a data 
breach. Examples include a database with an individuals 
name, credit card information and other personally identifiable 
information (PII) or a health record with the policyholders name 
and payment information.How do you collect the data? 
Our researchers collected in\-depth qualitative data through over 
3,600 separate interviews with individuals at 550 organizations 
that suffered a data breach between March 2021 and March 
1\. Interviewees included IT, compliance and information 
security practitioners familiar with their organizations data 
breach and the costs associated with resolving the breach. 
For privacy purposes, we didnt collect organization\-specific 
information.How do you calculate the average cost of a data breach? 
We collected both the direct and indirect expenses incurred by 
the organization. Direct expenses included engaging forensic 
experts, outsourcing hotline support and providing free credit 
monitoring subscriptions and discounts for future products and 
services. Indirect costs included in\-house investigations and 
communication, and the extrapolated value of customer loss 
resulting from turnover or diminished customer acquisition rates.This research represented only events directly relevant to the 
data breach experience. Regulations such as the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer 
Privacy Act (CCPA) may encourage organizations to increase 
investments in their cybersecurity governance technologies. 
However, such activities didnt directly affect the cost of a data 
breach for this research.For consistency with prior years, we used the same currency 
translation method rather than adjusting accounting costs.How does benchmark research differ from survey research? 
The unit of analysis in the Cost of a Data Breach Report was 
the organization. In survey research, the unit of analysis is the 
individual. We recruited 550 organizations to participate in
this study.55Research limitationsOur study used a confidential and proprietary benchmark 
method that has been successfully deployed in earlier research. 
However, the inherent limitations with this benchmark research 
need to be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from 
findings.Non\-statistical results 
Our study drew upon a representative, non\-statistical sample 
of global entities. Statistical inferences, margins of error and 
confidence intervals cant be applied to these data, given that 
our sampling methods werent scientific.Non\-response 
Non\-response bias wasnt tested, so its possible that companies 
that didnt participate are substantially different in terms of 
underlying data breach cost.Sampling\-frame bias 
Because our sampling frame was judgmental, the quality of 
results was influenced by the degree to which the frame was 
representative of the population of companies being studied. 
We believe that the current sampling frame was biased toward 
companies with more mature privacy or information security 
programs.Company\-specific information 
The benchmark didnt capture company\-identifying information. 
Individuals could use categorical response variables to disclose 
demographic information about the company and industry 
category.Unmeasured factors 
We omitted variables from our analyses such as leading trends 
and organizational characteristics. The extent to which omitted 
variables might explain benchmark results cant be determined.Extrapolated cost results 
While certain checks and balances can be incorporated into the 
benchmark process, its always possible that respondents didnt 
provide accurate or truthful responses. In addition, the use of 
cost extrapolation methods rather than actual cost data may 
inadvertently introduce bias and inaccuracies.Currency conversions
The conversion from local currencies to the US dollar deflated 
average total cost estimates in other countries. For purposes of 
consistency with prior years, we decided to continue to use the 
same accounting method rather than adjust the cost.The benchmark didnt capture any 
company\-identifying information.56About Ponemon

systems and information through prevention, detection and response to improper 
access from within and outside your enterprise. Improper access can result in 
information being altered, destroyed, misappropriated or misused or can result in 
damage to or misuse of your systems, including for use in attacks on others. No IT 
system or product should be considered completely secure and no single product, 
service or security measure can be completely effective in preventing improper 
use or access. IBM systems, products and services are designed to be part of a 
lawful, comprehensive security approach, which will necessarily involve additional 
operational procedures, and may require other systems, products or services to 
be most effective. IBM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY SYSTEMS, PRODUCTS 
OR SERVICES ARE IMMUNE FROM, OR WILL MAKE YOUR ENTERPRISE IMMUNE 
FROM, THE MALICIOUS OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY PARTY.The client is responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations
