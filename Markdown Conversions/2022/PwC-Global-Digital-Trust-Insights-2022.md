Seventy\-five percent of C\-suiterespondents to our survey, including CISOs,say their companies are too complex, avoidablyand unnecessarily so, and nearly as many saycomplexity poses concerning cyber and privacyrisks to their organisations in 11 key areas.Data seems to be a chief point of concern,especially among large companies (revenues of $1billion or more).

Digital\-native companies those that exist entirely online tend to usethe newest technologies, which are designedto connect and operate together.

The larger anorganisation, the more complex it will naturally be,needing more people and technologies to serve agrowing customer base.The costs of creating unnecessary complexityare not obvious, and its hard to create urgencyaround combatting complexity that is, until anattack occurs.One company needlessly kept the sensitive dataof people it no longer did business with, makingthat data available for hackers to steal.In our article Simplifying cyber, we give examplesof how simplification can improve security. At aglobal retail organisation, six vendors managedcustomer contacts. Two of those vendorssystems had been breached in the past. Afterconsulting with the CEO and board, the newoperations director whittled the vendor list to two.This simplification improved security: Monitoringtwo vendors is easier than keeping tabs on six,making information access easier to control, andthe retailer could more readily back up the smallercache of customer data.Asked to name the top consequences ofoperational complexity, our respondents named:1\.Financial losses due to successful databreaches or cyber attacks.2\.Inability to innovate as quickly as the marketopportunities allow.3\.Lack of operational resilience, or theability to recover from a cyber attack ortechnology failure.Complexity not only threatens todays fortunes,in the view of executives.

Even knowingwhere to begin can be difficult, especially giventhe attacks hitting businesses on every front.Asked to prioritise among nine initiatives aimedat simplifying cyber programs and processes,respondents couldnt choose, allotting near\-equalimportance to all of them. CISOs who are buildinglayers of control, for defense in depth, are well\-intentioned but must guard against introducingmore complexity and cost. More controls dontalways make a company more secure.Moving to the cloud can help simplify businessprocesses and IT architecture, provide flexibilityand accelerate innovation. Yet companiestypically waste an average of 35% of their cloudbudgets on inefficiencies. Runaway complexitycan quickly result from extensive technologyoptions, new architectural approaches,complicated service plans, unused capacity andconfusing billing and pricing, especially when thetechnologies offered are constantly changing.Done right, however, cloud transformationscan be secure, efficient, and successful. Cloudsecurity is the top investment priority of oursurvey respondents, as well as in our JuneUS\-specific survey. Thats encouraging butonly 16% report realising benefits from theseinvestments.

Doing sorequires asking hard questions and maintaininga keep\-it\-simple mindset. To get there, yourorganisation will need security\-minded leadershipstarting at the very top.Dont overlook moves that can have a significantimpact.

You can ignite major changes operational and cultural simply by asking this one question of every businessexecutive in charge of a transformation or new business initiative. By placing cybersecurity front\-row\-center, you can avoid the unnecessary and costlycomplexities you may see now, when its an afterthought.Include the CISO and security teams early in cloud migration and adoption, mergers and acquisitions, and other organisational initiatives. That way, everyexecutive at the helm of a major business initiative will be able to readily answer the cyber\-plan question.For the CISO and CIODare to subtract. Left on their own, technology and data tend to multiply, divide, and conquer efficiency and security. Whittle down excess with securitygoals in mind: assess your data stores and eliminate everything you dont need now; move your disparate apps and solutions into a cloud environment foreasier management; and consolidate, liquidate, and automate where you can.Also, rethink your tech and cyber investment processes. Focus first on simplifying where benefits are greatest for the whole organisation.19\|PwC 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights

The same goes for those who havemature data minimisation processes.Data is the asset attackers covet most. Yourcompanies can minimise that risk by minimisingthe target. You must govern, discover and protectonly the data you need and eliminate the rest.Drafts, duplicates, superseded data, legacydata and employee personal data are commoncandidates for elimination. Low\-value data notonly creates unnecessary risk, it also crowds outor buries your high\-value data.The two\-thirds of organisations that haventformally implemented data trust practices maybe at risk in more ways than one. Effective datagovernance is important not only for operationalresilience but also for compliance with regulationssuch as the European Unions General DataProtection Regulation (GDPR) and the CaliforniaPrivacy Rights Act (CPRA). New, more stringentregulations loom on the horizon as well. Whensomeone asks for information about their data what youre keeping and what youre doing withit youd better be able to answer quickly andaccurately.

Still, as we saw above, only 26%quantify cyber risks today.The data you use to spot and understandthreats, put a dollar figure on risks and prioritisethem, and predict cybercrime trends can be apowerful tool for convincing boards and the CEOto invest in your cyber program. On the otherhand, if youre having trouble getting the fundingyou need for cyber, you may need to do a betterjob of quantifying your cybersecurity risk.By the same token, data can help you stayapprised of real\-time risks, and adjust securitytactics and strategies as the business shifts.Respondents in five business sectors said themost important reason to quantify cyber risk isto continuously evaluate our risk landscape andpriorities against changing business objectives.Enterprise leaders recognise that risks arealways in a state of flux and that data is the toolthat lets them monitor and measure changes.Sizing up risks is also important for sizing upopportunities and linking cyber\-threat narrativesto business narratives that the C\-suite andboards can understand.
