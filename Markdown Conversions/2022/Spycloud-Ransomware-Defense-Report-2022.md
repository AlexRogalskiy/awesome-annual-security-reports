The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report
The Escalating Ransomware ProblemWithin the past 12 months, ransomware attacks have forced a 157\-year\-old college to close its doors, a leading automaker to 
halt operations for a day, and an entire nation to declare a state of emergency. After dominating the headlines for several years, 
these kinds of stories may feel like old news by now. Yet the escalation of the ransomware threat into a global crisis keeps it at 
the top of the cybersecurity agenda for many organizations. 
A recent SpyCloud sponsored survey of enterprise CISOs found that ransomware is the most concerning issue they face today. 
And for good reason: 66% of organizations were hit by ransomware in 2021, compared to 37% in 2020\.
Not only is ransomware more prolific but threat actors also have gotten savvier they succeeded in encrypting data in 65% of 
attacks last year, up from 54% in 2020\. Adding to the injury is the fact that the majority of ransomware schemes now involve 
double extortion, with attackers stealing data first and threatening to leak it if the ransom isnt paid. Just two years ago, only one 
gang used this tactic while today its present in 77% of attacks.
In last years Ransomware Defense Report, we learned that organizations felt pessimistic about their prospects of avoiding 
an attack. Only 18% of those surveyed believed a ransomware incident wasnt likely to happen to their organization, while 22% 
believed it would likely happen multiple times. We wanted to see how things have changed since then and this years survey 
found that organizations feel even less confident today in their ability to fight back.
As we discuss in this report, ransomware remains a broad, persistent, and complicated problem to solve. To help organizations 
gain a more holistic understanding of this threat, we also discuss the often\-overlooked aspects of ransomware attacks and how 
organizations can address them.

Key Findings
1\. 
 
The prevalence of ransomware attacks is on the rise. Year 
over year, we saw a significant decrease in the number 
of organizations that havent been hit by ransomware in 
the past 12 months (10% in 2022 vs. 27\.5% in 2021\) and 
a significant increase in the number of those that have 
experienced multiple attacks (50% were hit two to five times 
in the past year vs. 33\.5% the previous year, and nearly 78% 
were hit between two times and 10\+ times in the past year 
vs. nearly 52% the year before).

About the SpyCloud SurveyFollowing the 2021 Ransomware Defense Report, SpyCloud 
wanted to learn how security leaders and practitioners 
perceptions about the threat have changed and what theyre 
doing differently, if anything, to defend against ransomware. 
This year, we surveyed 310 individuals in active IT security roles 
at US, UK, and Canadian organizations that have at least 500 
employees.
We examined areas such as:
In addition to highlighting the survey findings, the report 
offers insights into how you can boost your organizations 
ransomware defenses. We encourage you to use this actionable 
data as a benchmark for your organizations preparedness and 
for making decisions on how to close your preparedness gaps.

Survey Demographics
SpyCloud solicited responses from individuals whose 
roles range from IT security analysts and architects
engineers, all the way to the executive suite. The majority 
of the 310 participants came from senior levels: 34% 
are CIOs, CISOs, and security executives; and 50% are 
security directors, managers, or team leads (Figure 1\).
We surveyed a cross\-section of organization sizes 
(Figure 2\), from small (500\-999 employees) and 
midmarket (between 1,000 and 9,999 employees) to 
large enterprises (with 10,000 or more employees). The 
biggest cohort (46%) represents employers with 1,000\-
4,999 workers, followed by 23% from small companies 
(500\-999 employees) and 18% from companies with 
5000\-9,999 employees. Respondents from the largest 
enterprises (10,000\+ employees) comprise 12% of 
respondents.

2\.
Organizations feel less confident about their defenses 
this year. We found a slight across\-the\-board decrease 
in the number of organizations indicating their existing 
ransomware mitigation solutions are in good shape, and 
an uptick in organizations looking to upgrade or add new 
security technologies. Additionally, more organizations have 
implemented Plan B measures this year, from opening 
cryptocurrency accounts to purchasing ransomware 
insurance riders. These findings suggest that organizations 
realize threats are slipping through their defenses and a 
ransomware attack is inevitable. 
3\.
The combination of unpatched vulnerabilities, phishing 
emails, and unmanaged devices creates the highest risks. 
Survey participants ranked these three vectors as the riskiest 
entry points for ransomware. Its important to understand that 
all of these entry points are interconnected and together, 
they greatly increase the risk of a successful ransomware 
attack.
4\.
Organizations are leaving gaps in their layered defenses. 
We werent surprised to learn that organizations see data 
backup as their most important countermeasure and 67\.8% 
are satisfied with the performance of their solution. Likewise, 
user awareness and endpoint detection are among the other 
typical defenses at the top. We were surprised, however, 
to see how many organizations overlook other important 
defenses. For example, monitoring for compromised 
web sessions is perceived as the third least important 
countermeasure. This and other gaps in organizations 
layered defenses give ransomware operators more 
opportunities to gain access. 
5\.
Lack of visibility into true compromises creates bigger 
exposure. Although unpatched vulnerabilities, phishing 
emails, and unmanaged devices deserve attention as risky 
attack vectors, the riskiest entry points that security teams 
cant see result in an even bigger vulnerability. Devices 
infected with malware, for example, create one of the biggest 
exposures to ransomware, and without visibility into those 
devices and into the resulting accounts compromised 
through malware\-siphoned data, organizations dont have the 
complete picture of their risk.

Section 1 \| Losing Ground to Ransomware 
A Bleak Picture
Research from the past year overwhelmingly points to the ransomware problem continuing its upward trajectory. Once again, it 
was the top threat in 2021, as observed by IBM Security researchers in their latest report. The 13% growth seen in ransomware\-
related breaches in the past year is as big as the last five years combined, according to the latest Verizon Data Breach 
Investigations Report (DBIR).Going into our survey, we expected to find similar results and we did, including a jump to 90% in the number of organizations 
affected by ransomware at least once in the past year, compared to 72\.5% the previous year (Figure 3\). Several other year\-over\-
year changes indicate that organizations are losing ground to ransomware:

last years 33\.5%; and in the number of those 
affected six to 10 times, to 20\.3% from 13\.1%. 
 
Overall, 77\.7% of surveyed organizations reported 
being hit between two times and 10\+ times vs. 
51\.7% in the previous years survey.

Size Doesnt Matter
While smaller organizations often think that ransomware attackers target the better\-healed large enterprises, thats simply not 
the case. Our research shows that no size of organization is immune.This year, the percentage of companies affected in each size category is spread very closely, with a range between 82\.4% for the 
largest enterprises and 91\.5% for organizations with 1,000\-4,999 employees (Figure 4\). But the smallest organizations seem to 
have it slightly worse than the largest ones, likely due to having fewer security resources which means they need to look for 
cost\-effective technologies that level the playing field.
To Pay or Not to Pay?
Among those hit by ransomware in the past year, 65% ended up paying the ransom (Figure 5\). But that doesnt mean they 
recovered their data. We found that of those that paid, slightly more than half recovered their data fully and roughly a third 
succeeded in partial recovery. Of those that didnt pay, 92% managed to recover their data through means such as data backups. 
This may seem like good news on the surface but its not necessarily so those organizations cannot be sure if the stolen data 
was already shared on the dark web prior to retrieval, making it available to other cybercriminals.

Keep in mind that the ransom is only a small part of the total cost of a ransomware attack. Even if the attack doesnt result in 
encrypted or stolen data or in paid ransom, theres a variety of other implications, including mitigation time, impact to customer\-
facing services, and loss of employee productivity. In the private sector, 86% of companies report losing revenue as a result of a 
ransomware incident and 90% say they lost their ability to operate. Additionally, 37% report having to lay off employees and 35% 
say they experienced C\-level resignations. And while the impact depends on the nature of the business, the overall costs are far 
reaching. While the average ransom was $812,360 globally last year, the average cost of remediation was much higher $1\.4 
million.
Perception Is Everything
This year, we also wanted to know what organizations are concerned about the most as a result of a ransomware attack. Four 
of the top five concerns exposure of sensitive or proprietary data, damage to brand reputation, loss of customer productivity 
or satisfaction due to operational disruptions, and interruption of critical servicesinfrastructure relate to external perceptions 
(Figure 6\). These outward\-facing concerns likely stem from a combination of factors:
 
Through their double\-extortion campaigns, criminals are advertising their actions.
 
Even if cyberattackers arent vocal about it, a ransomware attack is much more visible to stakeholders and 
potentially to the public, compared to other types of cyber incidents.
 
Brand reputation is instrumental to growing a business, and thus of great concern.
 
Boards have a heightened sensitivity to ransomware attacks, and theyre growing more aware about the 
immense business implications.

Losing Confidence in Prevention and Defense
Year over year, we found a decrease across the board in the number of respondents satisfied with their existing security 
technologies and an increase in those planning to upgrade or add to their toolset (Figure 7\). This shift indicates organizations are 
aware that threats are slipping through and realize that gaps remain despite those layers of defense.
With ransomware attackers gaining ground, its understandable that organizations feel less confident in their defenses. Clearly, 
they see room for improvement and want to dedicate more effort to get there. The key is to ensure that any upgrades or 
additions to the security stack approach ransomware risk holistically and fill the cracks in the security posture, rather than 
creating more legwork that has limited impact.

Section 2 \| Visibility Gaps and Ineffective Countermeasures 
Creating Greater Risk
Are Countermeasures Truly Working?
Survey participants ranked data backup, user awareness, endpoint security, intrusion detection systems, and email security as 
the most valuable countermeasures against ransomware (Figure 8\). This approach gives them blanket coverage for people, data, 
endpoints, network, and email, which have been the most important or highly targeted assets.

Yet, as discussed earlier, it appears that these technologies do not solve the problem effectively. Organizations are preparing 
for the inevitability of a ransomware incident, and more have implemented alternative measures this year, including opening a 
bitcoin account and creating response plans for ransomware incidents (Figure 9\).
The highest jump was in ransomware\-specific insurance riders, from 50\.4% last year to 72\.3% this year. This leap reflects the 
overall growing interest in cybersecurity insurance in recent years 64% of companies have purchased it in 2022 compared to 
two years ago.Shifting some of the risk to an insurance carrier may be a prudent move in many cases. However, it doesnt solve the underlying 
issue of inadequate prevention and, therefore, its a temporary rather than long\-term answer to preventing an attack in the first 
place. Think of it like buying car insurance. If you get in an accident, the insurance will cover some of your expenses, but that 
doesnt mean you should be driving around recklessly without a seatbelt. You should still rely on good driving habits to prevent 
an accident. And just like with auto insurance, if you have too many claims, your premiums quickly shoot up or worse, you 
could lose coverage altogether.
The Riskiest Entry Points
Compared to last year, participants ranked all potential ransomware entry points as more concerning. Unpatched vulnerabilities, 
phishing emails, and unmanaged devices are perceived as the riskiest vectors (Figure 10\). Its not surprising to see unpatched 
vulnerabilities at the top, as theyre a common tactic for attackers, who often infiltrate an organization by infecting a device 
with malware. Ransomware is a malware problem last year, ransomware was present in 70% of malware\-related breaches, 
according to Verizons DBIR.Likewise, phishing, unmanaged personal devices (or even shared family devices that are used to access work applications), 
weak or exposed credentials, and any other of these entry points increase exposure to malware. Each of them creates a risk 
individually, but together, they act as force multipliers. Additionally, threat actors target these vectors not only during initial entry 
but also during multiple stages of an attack, enabling them to escalate privileges, move laterally, and carry out their ultimate 
objective.

What organizations perceive as their biggest risks doesnt always 
reflect the full picture, either. Typically, threat actors must take a series 
of intermediate steps before deploying the ransomware, and malware 
infections are often a precursor to ransomware attacks. Malware\-
infected devices, in particular, are extremely risky because cybercriminals 
can siphon data such as credentials, browser fingerprints, and session 
cookies, enabling them to impersonate an employee, bypass multi\-factor 
authentication, and launch an attack. The risk is massive because one 
infected device could access dozens and potentially a few hundred 
corporate applications and every application compromised by 
malware, whether its a CRM database, collaboration platform, or SSO 
instance, creates an entry point from that single infected device.Unmanaged devices pose the greatest concern because the lack of 
visibility means they cant be monitored for threats such as malware 
and third\-party application exposures. Security teams seldom have this 
visibility into their attack surface and therefore often underestimate their 
malware\-related risks. 
How Malware\-Infected Devices 
Make Your Organization a Target
Many ransomware operators outsource the first 
stage of their attack the initial entry to a 
specialized group called initial access brokers. 
These brokers use a variety of tactics to infiltrate 
an organization, but typically they look for ways 
to impersonate an insider rather than trying 
to break through firewalls and other intrusion 
prevention technology. To impersonate an insider, 
they need data such as credentials to log in or 
cookies that enable session hijacking and 
thats where malware\-infected devices come in.Using infostealers malware specifically 
designed to harvest information from a device 
cybercriminals siphon data like credentials and 
browser fingerprints (which serve to authenticate 
a user) straight from the endpoint. Even if you 
detect the malware and wipe the device clean, 
the damage is done because the stolen data 
is most likely already on its way to the criminal 
underground.Data from malware\-infected devices is valuable 
to initial access brokers because its current, 
accurate, and they can log into your network with 
a greater degree of success.Data siphoned by malware also puts your 
organization on the attackers radar in the first 
place. Like any other cybercriminals, ransomware 
gangs dont always target specific organizations 
but are rather looking for opportunistic targets. 
They may simply ask initial access brokers for 
any potential targets with easy access, such 
as compromised credentials and cookies, that 
fit their desired profile. If your company is on 
that list, your likelihood of being the next target 
skyrockets.

The Growing Concern Over Credential\-Stealing Malware
This year, we asked survey participants if reports of credential\-stealing malware, such as RedLine Stealer, have elevated their 
organizations concern of unmonitored personal devices being a potential entry point for ransomware. We werent surprised to 
find that, indeed, it does, with 87% of respondents in agreement (Figure 11\).

Concerned About Credential\-Stealing Malware?
Figure 11
As the name implies, credential\-stealing malware is a type of infostealer that harvests credentials. In the past year, RedLine 
Stealer was one of the most widely used infostealers for Windows devices. Often distributed through phishing campaigns, this 
malware steals, among other things, data from browsers. The 
stolen data includes stored passwords, browser fingerprints, and 
session cookies, which threat actors can use to log into corporate 
applications and systems, bypassing MFA, to launch a ransomware 
attack.RedLine Stealer can masquerade as legitimate Windows updates 
and other software, making it difficult to detect. The infostealer also 
poses a big risk for unmonitored personal devices that employees 
use to access the corporate network and applications. Without 
any visibility into those devices, security teams have no way to 
monitor for malware infections and risky employee behavior such 
as accessing critical third\-party applications from their infected 
endpoints.

Section 3 \| Overcoming Barriers and Improving Preparedness
People: The Top Barrier to Effective Defenses
Lack of budgets and board support were major hurdles for security teams in the past. Business leaders wide\-spread awareness 
about the ransomware problem, however, created a silver lining: budget allocations and board involvement are no longer 
obstacles. In fact, board support grew from the previous year, likely a testament to the high\-profile, high\-impact nature of the 
threat. Other research from the past year shows that 86% of organizations have increased their security budgets to fight 
ransomware.The top three barriers called out by our survey participants are lack of skilled personnel to implement solutions, difficulty 
implementing related tools or technologies, and low security awareness among employees (Figure 12\). In other words, the 
biggest barrier is people.

The talent gap retains the top spot from last year, a recurring theme thats been vexing the security industry for many years. The 
Great Resignation exacerbated the challenge as all sectors experienced a revolving door of employees leaving their jobs. In the 
US, for example, cybersecurity job openings grew 29% in the past year, more than double the pre\-pandemic growth rate.A 2022 survey of security operations center (SOC) analysts found that 69% of teams are understaffed and workloads have 
increased for 60% of them in the past year. But the problem is likely to get even worse 71% said theyre experiencing job 
burnout and 64% said theyre likely to switch jobs in the next 12 months.One way to alleviate the shortage of people is by automating workflows as much as possible. Select your security stack 
thoughtfully so you avoid inducing alert fatigue. By choosing solutions that bring definitive answers rather than producing more 
alerts, you can reduce both security team workload and burnout.In terms of employee awareness, consider creating a safety net that protects your organization when employee awareness 
doesnt. Humans will inevitably make mistakes, and even the savviest employees (including security practitioners) can fall for a 
crafty fraudsters tricks. Even if you have a strong employee awareness program, implement solutions that help mitigate risks 
created by human behavior. Better yet, look for tools that both encourage positive security behaviors and reduce the risks of 
inevitable human error.Worth noting is that other conflicting priorities moved from last years fourth spot to the bottom of the list of hurdles. Perhaps 
the magnitude of ransomware has escalated to such a degree that it placed all the other types of threats firmly in its shadow.
The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report
Common Defenses
The top solutions already in place among 
surveyed organizations are data backup, MFA, 
user awareness training, networkresource 
segmentation, email security, and patching and 
secure configuration management (Figure 13\). 
This is an appropriate set of technologies, given 
how ransomware operates. The primary focus 
for security teams is on stopping malware and its 
related entry points while also preparing to restore 
and recover data when an incident inevitably takes 
place.

Of these five technologies, data backup (62%), email security (52%), MFA (51%), and endpointdevice protection (46%) also made 
the list of solutions that organizations feel are already in good shape, with credential monitoring (45%) rounding up the top five 
in this category (Figure 7\). Data backup, however, had a slight drop in the good shape score and an uptick in planned upgrades, 
which could signal that some organizations made hasty investments in subpar solutions and are now working to rectify the 
situation.
16
And finally, the third existing or planned password and authentication practice that saw significant year\-over\-year growth 
is monitoring for compromised partner and supplier credentials (75% increase). Several high\-profile supply chain attacks in 
the past two years exposed how vulnerable all organizations are to third\-party risk, and this concern is now top of mind for 
CISOs. Supply chain attacks ranked as the third greatest concern in the CISO survey sponsored by SpyCloud, while third\-party 
vulnerabilities and risks were the highest\-ranked type of vulnerability. Recognizing that partners and vendors are a weak link, 
organizations are taking additional measures to minimize this risk.
The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report
Changes in Password and Authentication Practices
Among password and authentication practices specifically, MFA is now table stakes. We discovered a 71% jump (from 56% in 
2021 to 96% in 2022\) in the number of organizations that have MFA in place or plan to implement it (Figure 14\). Another big 
jump was in monitoring for compromised employee credentials, from 44% to 73%.These two changes show organizations now realize that credentials are at the forefront of protecting employee identities. 
Additionally, with the exception of single sign\-on (SSO), we found an increase in every authentication practice this year. Thats 
great news in todays threat landscape \- where the problem of compromised, weak, and reused credentials is rampant.In 2021 alone, SpyCloud recaptured 1\.7 billion exposed credential pairs from the criminal underground. We also discovered a 
64% password reuse rate for users with more than one password exposed in the last year. By placing a bigger emphasis on 
password and authentication measures, you are in a better position to prevent the risk of compromised logins and to protect 
identities and consequently, greatly improve your organizations ability to prevent ransomware incidents.

Future Plans to Improve Defense
Concern about third\-party risk is so great that it surpassed ransomware in our survey as the factor impacting upcoming security 
investments the most moving to the top from last years fourth spot (Figure 15\).
Remote Work Loses Importance
Remote work dominated much of security teams attention in 2020 and 2021, but organizations have moved on to other 
priorities. The remote workforce has the least impact on investments planned for the coming year, according to our survey 
respondents. This shift is likely due to organizations embracing the new reality created by remote and hybrid work and realizing 
that protecting the network is no longer enough. The new approach is to protect identities, and this strategy is the best way to 
solve challenges associated with ransomware attacks.The new hybrid workplace creates an environment in which unmanaged devices and unmanaged cloud applications generate 
many new places where workers can accidentally expose data or give criminals entry points, yet security teams still arent 
focusing sufficiently on these vulnerabilities. Additionally, your attack surface is much broader than in the past. Even if your 
remote workforce is shrinking, the attack surface is not and many security teams dont have the visibility they need.
The increased severity of malware and data breaches are the third and fourth biggest factors driving planned investments in the 
next 12 months. Data breaches dropped to fourth place from last years second. Keep in mind that data stolen in breaches can 
facilitate new malware and ransomware attacks, so think of data breaches not simply as an outcome but as a source of further 
compromises. Worse, data breaches create a perpetual attack cycle because cybercriminals leverage the freshly stolen data 
to launch new attacks. Essentially, breaches are another force multiplier that boosts the odds of a successful attack for threat 
actors.Consider all the factors that drive your risk and think holistically when you make security investments especially when 
economic factors are at play and youre under pressure to cut expenses and maximize revenues. While you may feel tempted to 
halt the purchase of new security tools to fill those gaps, the financial and other impacts a breach can have on your organization 
will outweigh the small savings from downsizing security investments.

Upgrades and Additions to the Security Stack
As noted earlier, organizations are more dissatisfied in general this year with their security stack and more of them plan to update 
or upgrade their technologies (Figure 7\). If we look at the growing dissatisfaction through the lens of the higher number of 
organizations affected by ransomware, we suspect that organizations had a misplaced confidence in their security last year but 
have seen the shortcomings since then.Moreover, solutions that have been less considered before, such as monitoring for compromised web sessions, are among the 
top countermeasures planned for addition. This suggests that organizations are looking to extend protection to other areas as 
threat actors, confronted with the more traditional defenses, shift their focus to other vulnerabilities that are less often or less 
thoroughly protected. Major attacks in recent months also served to drive up malware concerns, sparking further interest in 
additional security layers.Monitoring for malware\-compromised devices or web session cookies is an effective way of preventing ransomware incidents 
because youre proactively protecting vulnerable employees before threat actors can access their accounts through session 
hijacking. Armed with this data, attackers can use anti\-detect browsers to bypass MFA and even newer browser fingerprinting 
anti\-fraud technologies. This type of monitoring helps you identify employees whose endpoints have been infected by 
infostealers so you can invalidate their active web sessions and take further post\-infection remediation steps.Post\-infection remediation (Figure 16\) is a critical yet frequently overlooked step in malware incident response. Wiping \& 
reimaging an infected device doesnt mitigate long\-term ransomware risk created unless all compromised applications are also 
properly remediated. And for that you need a complete picture of the exposed credentials, stolen session cookies, and other data 
that could allow ransomware operators to walk right in. With information about each exposed device, application, and user, you 
can accelerate remediation and significantly shorten the enterprise exposure window.

Focus on Prevention to Boost Resilience
The findings of this years report may feel discouraging as they illustrate 
that ransomware gangs continue to experience widespread success 
in their nefarious endeavors. However, the data from this report can 
help you look at the ransomware problem from a different perspective. 
The incomplete understanding of the hidden ransomware risks and 
vulnerabilities is a big reason why organizations are falling further 
behind the attackers. Use the report as an opportunity to understand 
the hidden risks and weaknesses, such as hard\-to\-detect malware 
infections and unmanaged devices, that may be affecting your own 
organization.While you continue to strengthen and expand your defensive layers, 
you should place an equal, if not bigger, emphasis on prevention. The 
cost of effective ransomware prevention is much lower than the cost 
of response and recovery from an incident. Any proactive measures 
that you implement for ransomware prevention and early detection 
also help you fight other threats, boosting your organizations security 
posture and, most importantly, improving your overall resilience to 
cyber threats.
