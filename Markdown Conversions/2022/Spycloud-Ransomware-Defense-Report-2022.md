The Escalating Ransomware ProblemWithin the past 12 months, ransomware attacks have forced a 157\-year\-old college to close its doors, a leading automaker tohalt operations for a day, and an entire nation to declare a state of emergency. After dominating the headlines for several years,these kinds of stories may feel like old news by now. Yet the escalation of the ransomware threat into a global crisis keeps it atthe top of the cybersecurity agenda for many organizations.A recent SpyCloud sponsored survey of enterprise CISOs found that ransomware is the most concerning issue they face today.And for good reason: 66% of organizations were hit by ransomware in 2021, compared to 37% in 2020\.Not only is ransomware more prolific but threat actors also have gotten savvier they succeeded in encrypting data in 65% ofattacks last year, up from 54% in 2020\. Adding to the injury is the fact that the majority of ransomware schemes now involvedouble extortion, with attackers stealing data first and threatening to leak it if the ransom isnt paid. Just two years ago, only onegang used this tactic while today its present in 77% of attacks.In last years Ransomware Defense Report, we learned that organizations felt pessimistic about their prospects of avoidingan attack. Only 18% of those surveyed believed a ransomware incident wasnt likely to happen to their organization, while 22%believed it would likely happen multiple times. We wanted to see how things have changed since then and this years surveyfound that organizations feel even less confident today in their ability to fight back.As we discuss in this report, ransomware remains a broad, persistent, and complicated problem to solve. To help organizationsgain a more holistic understanding of this threat, we also discuss the often\-overlooked aspects of ransomware attacks and howorganizations can address them.The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report3About the SpyCloud SurveySurvey DemographicsFollowing the 2021 Ransomware Defense Report, SpyCloudSpyCloud solicited responses from individuals whosewanted to learn how security leaders and practitionersroles range from IT security analysts and architectsperceptions about the threat have changed and what theyreengineers, all the way to the executive suite.

We encourage you to use this actionabledata as a benchmark for your organizations preparedness andfor making decisions on how to close your preparedness gaps.Key Findings1\.The prevalence of ransomware attacks is on the rise. Yearover year, we saw a significant decrease in the numberof organizations that havent been hit by ransomware inthe past 12 months (10% in 2022 vs. 27\.5% in 2021\) anda significant increase in the number of those that haveexperienced multiple attacks (50% were hit two to five timesin the past year vs. 33\.5% the previous year, and nearly 78%were hit between two times and 10\+ times in the past yearvs. nearly 52% the year before).The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report3% 2%5%6%34%50%CIO, CISO, or IT

Its important to understand thatall of these entry points are interconnected and together,they greatly increase the risk of a successful ransomwareattack.4\.Organizations are leaving gaps in their layered defenses.We werent surprised to learn that organizations see databackup as their most important countermeasure and 67\.8%are satisfied with the performance of their solution. Likewise,user awareness and endpoint detection are among the othertypical defenses at the top. We were surprised, however,to see how many organizations overlook other importantdefenses. For example, monitoring for compromisedweb sessions is perceived as the third least importantcountermeasure. This and other gaps in organizationslayered defenses give ransomware operators moreopportunities to gain access.5\.Lack of visibility into true compromises creates biggerexposure. Although unpatched vulnerabilities, phishingemails, and unmanaged devices deserve attention as riskyattack vectors, the riskiest entry points that security teamscant see result in an even bigger vulnerability. Devicesinfected with malware, for example, create one of the biggestexposures to ransomware, and without visibility into thosedevices and into the resulting accounts compromisedthrough malware\-siphoned data, organizations dont have thecomplete picture of their risk.The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report5Section 1 \| Losing Ground to RansomwareA Bleak PictureResearch from the past year overwhelmingly points to the ransomware problem continuing its upward trajectory. Once again, itwas the top threat in 2021, as observed by IBM Security researchers in their latest report. The 13% growth seen in ransomware\-related breaches in the past year is as big as the last five years combined, according to the latest Verizon Data BreachInvestigations Report (DBIR).Going into our survey, we expected to find similar results and we did, including a jump to 90% in the number of organizationsaffected by ransomware at least once in the past year, compared to 72\.5% the previous year (Figure 3\). Several other year\-over\-year changes indicate that organizations are losing ground to ransomware:Only 10% of respondents said their organizationsPast Frequency of Ransomware Incidents (YOY)werent affected, a significant decrease fromprevious years 27\.5%.There was a big jump in the number of thoseaffected two to five times, to 50% this year fromlast years 33\.5%; and in the number of thoseaffected six to 10 times, to 20\.3% from 13\.1%.Overall, 77\.7% of surveyed organizations reportedbeing hit between two times and 10\+ times vs.51\.7% in the previous years survey.The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report50%34%28%21%10%12%50%40%30%20%10%0%20%13%5% 7%NoneOne time2\-5 times6\-10 times\>10 times20212022Figure 36Size Doesnt MatterWhile smaller organizations often think that ransomware attackers target the better\-healed large enterprises, thats simply notthe case. Our research shows that no size of organization is immune.This year, the percentage of companies affected in each size category is spread very closely, with a range between 82\.4% for thelargest enterprises and 91\.5% for organizations with 1,000\-4,999 employees (Figure 4\). But the smallest organizations seem tohave it slightly worse than the largest ones, likely due to having fewer security resources which means they need to look forcost\-effective technologies that level the playing field.Affected At Least Once (By Organization Size)100%89%92%80%70%80%60%40%20%0%91%82%86%68%82%52%2021500 \- 999 employees1,000 \- 4,9995,000 \- 9,99910,000 \- 25,000\>25,0002022Figure 4To Pay or Not to Pay?Among those hit by ransomware in the past year, 65% ended up paying the ransom (Figure 5\). But that doesnt mean theyrecovered their data. We found that of those that paid, slightly more than half recovered their data fully and roughly a thirdsucceeded in partial recovery. Of those that didnt pay, 92% managed to recover their data through means such as data backups.This may seem like good news on the surface but its not necessarily so those organizations cannot be sure if the stolen datawas already shared on the dark web prior to retrieval, making it available to other cybercriminals.Response and Outcome of Ransomware AttacksPaid Ransom,

Even if the attack doesnt result inencrypted or stolen data or in paid ransom, theres a variety of other implications, including mitigation time, impact to customer\-facing services, and loss of employee productivity. In the private sector, 86% of companies report losing revenue as a result of aransomware incident and 90% say they lost their ability to operate. Additionally, 37% report having to lay off employees and 35%say they experienced C\-level resignations. And while the impact depends on the nature of the business, the overall costs are farreaching. While the average ransom was $812,360 globally last year, the average cost of remediation was much higher $1\.4million.Perception Is EverythingThis year, we also wanted to know what organizations are concerned about the most as a result of a ransomware attack. Fourof the top five concerns exposure of sensitive or proprietary data, damage to brand reputation, loss of customer productivityor satisfaction due to operational disruptions, and interruption of critical servicesinfrastructure relate to external perceptions(Figure 6\). These outward\-facing concerns likely stem from a combination of factors:Through their double\-extortion campaigns, criminals are advertising their actions.Even if cyberattackers arent vocal about it, a ransomware attack is much more visible to stakeholders andpotentially to the public, compared to other types of cyber incidents.Brand reputation is instrumental to growing a business, and thus of great concern.Boards have a heightened sensitivity to ransomware attacks, and theyre growing more aware about theimmense business implications.Greatest Impacts of Ransomware Attacks to Your OrganizationExposure of sensitive or proprietary dataDamage to brand reputationHard cost of recovering and restoring to normal operationsLoss of customer productivity or satisfaction due to operational disruptionsInterruption of critical servicesinfrastructureLoss of revenue due to operational disruptionsHard cost of regulatory compliancefinesInability to recover business\-critical dataLoss of employee productivity due to operational disruptionsHard cost of paying the ransomHaving to closeshut down the business3\.923\.853\.823\.753\.733\.693\.663\.653\.633\.603\.47On a scale of 1 to 5Figure 6The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report8Losing Confidence in Prevention and DefenseYear over year, we found a decrease across the board in the number of respondents satisfied with their existing securitytechnologies and an increase in those planning to upgrade or add to their toolset (Figure 7\). This shift indicates organizations areaware that threats are slipping through and realize that gaps remain despite those layers of defense.With ransomware attackers gaining ground, its understandable that organizations feel less confident in their defenses. Clearly,they see room for improvement and want to dedicate more effort to get there. The key is to ensure that any upgrades oradditions to the security stack approach ransomware risk holistically and fill the cracks in the security posture, rather thancreating more legwork that has limited impact.Security Technologies Planned for Ransomware MitigationAlready in good shapeData backupEmail security (with phishing detection)Multi\-factor authentication (MFA)Endpointdevice protectionPlan to UpgradeDeception technology (e.g virtual honeypots)Intrusion detection system (IDS)User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)User awarenesstrainingPatch \& secure configuration managementPlan to AddThreat intelligence service(s)sharing platformMonitoring for compromised credentialsUser and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)Deception technology (e.g virtual honeypots)Endpointdevice protection61\.9%52\.4%50\.5%45\.9%37\.9%33\.3%33\.1%32\.9%32\.8%25\.6%24\.3%23\.8%23\.5%22\.8%Figure 7The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report9Section 2 \| Visibility Gaps and Ineffective Countermeasures 
Creating Greater RiskAre Countermeasures Truly Working?Survey participants ranked data backup, user awareness, endpoint security, intrusion detection systems, and email security asthe most valuable countermeasures against ransomware (Figure 8\). This approach gives them blanket coverage for people, data,endpoints, network, and email, which have been the most important or highly targeted assets.Most Important Countermeasures for Mitigating Ransomware AttacksData backupUser awarenesstrainingEndpointdevice protectionIntrusion detection system (IDS)Email security (with phishing detection)Threat intelligence service(s)sharing platformMulti\-factor authentication (MFA)Monitoring for compromised credentialsPatch \& secure configuration managementDeception technology (e.g. virtual honeypots)Monitoring for compromised web sessions (stolen cookies)Networkresource segmentationUser and entity behavior analytics4\.344\.114\.104\.104\.094\.013\.993\.943\.933\.913\.893\.883\.85On a scale of 1 to 5Figure 8The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report10Yet, as discussed earlier, it appears that these technologies do not solve the problem effectively. Organizations are preparingfor the inevitability of a ransomware incident, and more have implemented alternative measures this year, including opening abitcoin account and creating response plans for ransomware incidents (Figure 9\).Preparations for Ransomware IncidentsCreated a ransomware\-specific

This leap reflects theoverall growing interest in cybersecurity insurance in recent years 64% of companies have purchased it in 2022 compared totwo years ago.Shifting some of the risk to an insurance carrier may be a prudent move in many cases. However, it doesnt solve the underlyingissue of inadequate prevention and, therefore, its a temporary rather than long\-term answer to preventing an attack in the firstplace. Think of it like buying car insurance. If you get in an accident, the insurance will cover some of your expenses, but thatdoesnt mean you should be driving around recklessly without a seatbelt. You should still rely on good driving habits to preventan accident. And just like with auto insurance, if you have too many claims, your premiums quickly shoot up or worse, youcould lose coverage altogether.The Riskiest Entry PointsCompared to last year, participants ranked all potential ransomware entry points as more concerning. Unpatched vulnerabilities,phishing emails, and unmanaged devices are perceived as the riskiest vectors (Figure 10\). Its not surprising to see unpatchedvulnerabilities at the top, as theyre a common tactic for attackers, who often infiltrate an organization by infecting a devicewith malware. Ransomware is a malware problem last year, ransomware was present in 70% of malware\-related breaches,according to Verizons DBIR.Likewise, phishing, unmanaged personal devices (or even shared family devices that are used to access work applications),weak or exposed credentials, and any other of these entry points increase exposure to malware. Each of them creates a riskindividually, but together, they act as force multipliers. Additionally, threat actors target these vectors not only during initial entrybut also during multiple stages of an attack, enabling them to escalate privileges, move laterally, and carry out their ultimateobjective.The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report11Riskiest Points of Entry for RansomwareUnpatched vulnerabilitiesPhishing emails with

devices w network access)Weak or exposed credentialsOpenvulnerable RDP portsThird\-party applications (chat, CRM)Stolen cookies that 
enable session hijackingSocial engineering3\.893\.813\.713\.683\.673\.643\.623\.52VPN connectionsinfrastructure3\.36On a scale of 1 to 5Figure 10What organizations perceive as their biggest risks doesnt alwaysreflect the full picture, either. Typically, threat actors must take a seriesof intermediate steps before deploying the ransomware, and malwareinfections are often a precursor to ransomware attacks. Malware\-infected devices, in particular, are extremely risky because cybercriminalscan siphon data such as credentials, browser fingerprints, and sessioncookies, enabling them to impersonate an employee, bypass multi\-factorauthentication, and launch an attack. The risk is massive because oneinfected device could access dozens and potentially a few hundredcorporate applications and every application compromised bymalware, whether its a CRM database, collaboration platform, or SSOinstance, creates an entry point from that single infected device.Unmanaged devices pose the greatest concern because the lack ofvisibility means they cant be monitored for threats such as malwareand third\-party application exposures. Security teams seldom have thisvisibility into their attack surface and therefore often underestimate theirmalware\-related risks.How Malware\-Infected Devices 
Make Your Organization a TargetMany ransomware operators outsource the first 
stage of their attack the initial entry to a 
specialized group called initial access brokers. 
These brokers use a variety of tactics to infiltrate 
an organization, but typically they look for ways 
to impersonate an insider rather than trying 
to break through firewalls and other intrusion 
prevention technology. To impersonate an insider, 
they need data such as credentials to log in or 
cookies that enable session hijacking and 
thats where malware\-infected devices come in.Using infostealers malware specifically 
designed to harvest information from a device 
cybercriminals siphon data like credentials and 
browser fingerprints (which serve to authenticate 
a user) straight from the endpoint. Even if you 
detect the malware and wipe the device clean, 
the damage is done because the stolen data 
is most likely already on its way to the criminal 
underground.Data from malware\-infected devices is valuable 
to initial access brokers because its current, 
accurate, and they can log into your network with 
a greater degree of success.Data siphoned by malware also puts your 
organization on the attackers radar in the first 
place. Like any other cybercriminals, ransomware 
gangs dont always target specific organizations 
but are rather looking for opportunistic targets. 
They may simply ask initial access brokers for 
any potential targets with easy access, such 
as compromised credentials and cookies, that 
fit their desired profile. If your company is on 
that list, your likelihood of being the next target 
skyrockets.The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report12The Growing Concern Over Credential\-Stealing MalwareThis year, we asked survey participants if reports of credential\-stealing malware, such as RedLine Stealer, have elevated theirorganizations concern of unmonitored personal devices being a potential entry point for ransomware. We werent surprised tofind that, indeed, it does, with 87% of respondents in agreement (Figure 11\).Concerned About Credential\-Stealing Malware?1%4%8%42%Strongly AgreeSomewhat Agree45%Neither Agree nor DisagreeSomewhat DisagreeStrongly DisagreeAs the name implies, credential\-stealing malware is a type of infostealer that harvests credentials. In the past year, RedLineStealer was one of the most widely used infostealers for Windows devices. Often distributed through phishing campaigns, thisFigure 11malware steals, among other things, data from browsers. Thestolen data includes stored passwords, browser fingerprints, andsession cookies, which threat actors can use to log into corporateapplications and systems, bypassing MFA, to launch a ransomwareattack.RedLine Stealer can masquerade as legitimate Windows updatesand other software, making it difficult to detect. The infostealer alsoposes a big risk for unmonitored personal devices that employeesuse to access the corporate network and applications. Withoutany visibility into those devices, security teams have no way tomonitor for malware infections and risky employee behavior suchas accessing critical third\-party applications from their infectedendpoints.The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report13Section 3 \| Overcoming Barriers and Improving PreparednessPeople: The Top Barrier to Effective DefensesLack of budgets and board support were major hurdles for security teams in the past. Business leaders wide\-spread awarenessabout the ransomware problem, however, created a silver lining: budget allocations and board involvement are no longerobstacles. In fact, board support grew from the previous year, likely a testament to the high\-profile, high\-impact nature of thethreat. Other research from the past year shows that 86% of organizations have increased their security budgets to fightransomware.The top three barriers called out by our survey participants are lack of skilled personnel to implement solutions, difficultyimplementing related tools or technologies, and low security awareness among employees (Figure 12\). In other words, thebiggest barrier is people.Obstacles to Establishing Effective Ransomware DefensesLack of skilled personnel to implement solutionsDifficulty implementing related toolstechnologiesLow security awareness among employeesLack of effective solutions available in the marketLack of budgetLack of support from executive managementboardOther conflicting priorities3\.493\.463\.413\.343\.293\.223\.13On a scale of 1 to 5Figure 12The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report14The talent gap retains the top spot from last year, a recurring theme thats been vexing the security industry for many years. TheGreat Resignation exacerbated the challenge as all sectors experienced a revolving door of employees leaving their jobs. In theUS, for example, cybersecurity job openings grew 29% in the past year, more than double the pre\-pandemic growth rate.A 2022 survey of security operations center (SOC) analysts found that 69% of teams are understaffed and workloads haveincreased for 60% of them in the past year. But the problem is likely to get even worse 71% said theyre experiencing jobburnout and 64% said theyre likely to switch jobs in the next 12 months.One way to alleviate the shortage of people is by automating workflows as much as possible. Select your security stackthoughtfully so you avoid inducing alert fatigue. By choosing solutions that bring definitive answers rather than producing morealerts, you can reduce both security team workload and burnout.In terms of employee awareness, consider creating a safety net that protects your organization when employee awarenessdoesnt. Humans will inevitably make mistakes, and even the savviest employees (including security practitioners) can fall for acrafty fraudsters tricks. Even if you have a strong employee awareness program, implement solutions that help mitigate riskscreated by human behavior. Better yet, look for tools that both encourage positive security behaviors and reduce the risks ofinevitable human error.Worth noting is that other conflicting priorities moved from last years fourth spot to the bottom of the list of hurdles. Perhapsthe magnitude of ransomware has escalated to such a degree that it placed all the other types of threats firmly in its shadow.Common DefensesThe top solutions already in place amongsurveyed organizations are data backup, MFA,Top Security Solutions in Placeuser awareness training, networkresourceData backupsegmentation, email security, and patching andMulti\-factor authentication (MFA)secure configuration management (Figure 13\).This is an appropriate set of technologies, givenhow ransomware operates. The primary focusfor security teams is on stopping malware and itsrelated entry points while also preparing to restoreand recover data when an incident inevitably takesplace.User awareness trainingNetworkresource segmentationEmail securityPatch \& secure configuration managementAlready have it87%77%76%75%74%74%Figure 13Of these five technologies, data backup (62%), email security (52%), MFA (51%), and endpointdevice protection (46%) also madethe list of solutions that organizations feel are already in good shape, with credential monitoring (45%) rounding up the top fivein this category (Figure 7\). Data backup, however, had a slight drop in the good shape score and an uptick in planned upgrades,which could signal that some organizations made hasty investments in subpar solutions and are now working to rectify thesituation.The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report15Changes in Password and Authentication PracticesAmong password and authentication practices specifically, MFA is now table stakes. We discovered a 71% jump (from 56% in2021 to 96% in 2022\) in the number of organizations that have MFA in place or plan to implement it (Figure 14\). Another bigjump was in monitoring for compromised employee credentials, from 44% to 73%.These two changes show organizations now realize that credentials are at the forefront of protecting employee identities.Additionally, with the exception of single sign\-on (SSO), we found an increase in every authentication practice this year. Thatsgreat news in todays threat landscape \- where the problem of compromised, weak, and reused credentials is rampant.In 2021 alone, SpyCloud recaptured 1\.7 billion exposed credential pairs from the criminal underground. We also discovered a64% password reuse rate for users with more than one password exposed in the last year. By placing a bigger emphasis onpassword and authentication measures, you are in a better position to prevent the risk of compromised logins and to protectidentities and consequently, greatly improve your organizations ability to prevent ransomware incidents.Password and Authentication PracticesMulti\-factor authentication (MFA)Password complexity requirements

Several high\-profile supply chain attacks inthe past two years exposed how vulnerable all organizations are to third\-party risk, and this concern is now top of mind forCISOs. Supply chain attacks ranked as the third greatest concern in the CISO survey sponsored by SpyCloud, while third\-partyvulnerabilities and risks were the highest\-ranked type of vulnerability. Recognizing that partners and vendors are a weak link,organizations are taking additional measures to minimize this risk.The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report16Future Plans to Improve DefenseConcern about third\-party risk is so great that it surpassed ransomware in our survey as the factor impacting upcoming securityinvestments the most moving to the top from last years fourth spot (Figure 15\).Greatest Impact to Cybersecurity PlansRisk of being attacked through partnerthird\-party connectionsIncreased frequency or sophistication of ransomware attacksIncreased frequency or severity of malwareIncreased frequency or severity of data breachesRegulatorycompliance requirementsHaving an increasingly remote workforce3\.893\.693\.593\.403\.353\.16On a scale of 1 to 5Figure 15The increased severity of malware and data breaches are the third and fourth biggest factors driving planned investments in thenext 12 months. Data breaches dropped to fourth place from last years second. Keep in mind that data stolen in breaches canfacilitate new malware and ransomware attacks, so think of data breaches not simply as an outcome but as a source of furthercompromises. Worse, data breaches create a perpetual attack cycle because cybercriminals leverage the freshly stolen datato launch new attacks. Essentially, breaches are another force multiplier that boosts the odds of a successful attack for threatactors.Consider all the factors that drive your risk and think holistically when you make security investments especially wheneconomic factors are at play and youre under pressure to cut expenses and maximize revenues. While you may feel tempted tohalt the purchase of new security tools to fill those gaps, the financial and other impacts a breach can have on your organizationwill outweigh the small savings from downsizing security investments.Remote Work Loses ImportanceRemote work dominated much of security teams attention in 2020 and 2021, but organizations have moved on to otherpriorities. The remote workforce has the least impact on investments planned for the coming year, according to our surveyrespondents. This shift is likely due to organizations embracing the new reality created by remote and hybrid work and realizingthat protecting the network is no longer enough. The new approach is to protect identities, and this strategy is the best way tosolve challenges associated with ransomware attacks.The new hybrid workplace creates an environment in which unmanaged devices and unmanaged cloud applications generatemany new places where workers can accidentally expose data or give criminals entry points, yet security teams still arentfocusing sufficiently on these vulnerabilities. Additionally, your attack surface is much broader than in the past. Even if yourremote workforce is shrinking, the attack surface is not and many security teams dont have the visibility they need.The 2022 SpyCloud Ransomware Defense Report17Upgrades and Additions to the Security StackAs noted earlier, organizations are more dissatisfied in general this year with their security stack and more of them plan to updateor upgrade their technologies (Figure 7\). If we look at the growing dissatisfaction through the lens of the higher number oforganizations affected by ransomware, we suspect that organizations had a misplaced confidence in their security last year buthave seen the shortcomings since then.Moreover, solutions that have been less considered before, such as monitoring for compromised web sessions, are among thetop countermeasures planned for addition. This suggests that organizations are looking to extend protection to other areas asthreat actors, confronted with the more traditional defenses, shift their focus to other vulnerabilities that are less often or lessthoroughly protected. Major attacks in recent months also served to drive up malware concerns, sparking further interest inadditional security layers.Monitoring for malware\-compromised devices or web session cookies is an effective way of preventing ransomware incidentsbecause youre proactively protecting vulnerable employees before threat actors can access their accounts through sessionhijacking. Armed with this data, attackers can use anti\-detect browsers to bypass MFA and even newer browser fingerprintinganti\-fraud technologies. This type of monitoring helps you identify employees whose endpoints have been infected byinfostealers so you can invalidate their active web sessions and take further post\-infection remediation steps.Post\-infection remediation (Figure 16\) is a critical yet frequently overlooked step in malware incident response. Wiping \&reimaging an infected device doesnt mitigate long\-term ransomware risk created unless all compromised applications are alsoproperly remediated. And for that you need a complete picture of the exposed credentials, stolen session cookies, and other datathat could allow ransomware operators to walk right in. With information about each exposed device, application, and user, youcan accelerate remediation and significantly shorten the enterprise exposure window.Post\-Infection RemediationP RE \- INFECTIONN

However, the data from this report canhelp you look at the ransomware problem from a different perspective.The incomplete understanding of the hidden ransomware risks andvulnerabilities is a big reason why organizations are falling furtherbehind the attackers. Use the report as an opportunity to understandthe hidden risks and weaknesses, such as hard\-to\-detect malwareinfections and unmanaged devices, that may be affecting your ownorganization.While you continue to strengthen and expand your defensive layers,you should place an equal, if not bigger, emphasis on prevention. Thecost of effective ransomware prevention is much lower than the costof response and recovery from an incident. Any proactive measuresthat you implement for ransomware prevention and early detectionalso help you fight other threats, boosting your organizations securityposture and, most importantly, improving your overall resilience tocyber threats.About SpyCloudSpyCloud transforms recaptured darknet data to protect businessesfrom cyberattacks.
