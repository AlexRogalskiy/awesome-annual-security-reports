unique role in the IT security industryOther surveys do a great 
job of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breaches 
and exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other bad 
actorsOur mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of IT 
security professionalsNow in its ninth year, the CDR has become a staple among IT 
security leaders and practitioners by helping them gauge their 
internal practices and security investments against those of their 
counterparts across multiple countries and industriesIf you 
want to know what your peers in IT security are thinking and 
doing, this is the place to lookCyberEdge would like to thank our Silver, Gold, and Platinum 
research sponsors, whose continued support is essential to the 
success of this reportTop Five Insights for 2022Survey DemographicsResponses received from 1,200 qualified IT securitydecision makers and practitionersAll from organizations with more than 500 employeesRepresenting 17 countries across North America,Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America,
and AfricaRepresenting 19 industries3 Among cyberthreats, ransomware and account takeover 
(ATO) attacks are poised to overtake malware as the \#1 
concernMalware is still perceived as the most important 
threat, but ATO and credential abuse attacks moved up from 
fourth place last year to \#2 this year, and ransomware is only 
a tad behindWe think one or the other will take over the top 
spot in the next year or two (see page 17\)As always, our latest CDR installment yields dozens of actionable 
insightsBut the following are the top five takeaways from this 
years report:412 There has been no let\-up in pressure on security teams
While the number of organizations that experienced a 
successful cyberattack dropped a touch from 86 2% in 
the previous survey to 85 3% in this one, the percentage 
victimized by six or more attacks increased to a new record 
of 40 7%And the number of respondents who think it 
is somewhat or very likely that their organization will be 
successfully attacked in the coming year reached a new 
record of 76 1% The biggest security issues for many organizations are 
a persistent shortfall of skilled IT security personnel 
and low security awareness among employeesThese 
continue to top the list of factors that inhibit organizations 
from adequately defending themselves against cyberthreats 
(see page 24\)We also see a lack of security skills across a 
wide range of job roles (page 15\) and find user security 
awareness to be an area where our survey respondents 
doubt their organizations capabilities (page 13\) Pressure from ransomware rachets up once againThe 
percentage of organizations victimized by a ransomware 
attack in the past 12 months rose 2 5% to reach a new high 
of 71 0%Ransom demands continued to rise, and the 
percentage of organizations deciding to pay jumped from 
57 0% to 62 9%, also a recordThe data also points to a sweet 
spot for ransomware gangs: organizations with 5,000 to 
25,000 employeesThese are being targeted more often than 
their smaller and larger counterparts because they can afford 
to pay high ransoms, yet disabling them does not typically 
disrupt local economies or shut down essential infrastructure 
and draw the attention of national governments and law 
enforcement agencies (see page 21\)5 Security teams are getting a handle on the new norm 
created by COVID\-19After scrambling to adapt to the 
disruptions caused by the pandemic, they are now well 
along in deploying and managing technologies and 
processes to build security into web and mobile applications, 
make work from home (WFH) secure, and improve the 
security and economics of networking with cloud\-based 
resources (see pages 50, 52, and 54, respectively)2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report3Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupIntroductionCyberwar and the Russian Invasion of Ukraine Where do we have gaps in our cyberthreat defenses relativeThis report is being written during the early stages of Russias 
invasion of UkraineObviously, our survey results dont reflect the 
impact of that eventHowever, in The Road Ahead section that 
begins on page 56, we offer some predictions about how the 
invasion may affect information security and the cybersecurity 
industryAbout This ReportThe CDR is the most geographically comprehensive, vendor\-
agnostic study of IT security decision makers and practitioners
Rather than compiling cyberthreat statistics and assessing 
the damage caused by data breaches, the CDR surveys the 
perceptions of IT security professionals, gaining insights into 
how they see the worldSpecifically, the CDR examines: The frequency of successful cyberattacks in the prior year and 
optimism (or pessimism) about preventing further attacks in 
the coming year The perceived impact of cyberthreats and the challengesto other organizations? Have we fallen behind in our defensive strategy to the pointthat our organization is now the low\-hanging fruit (i e , likely 
to be targeted more often due to its relative weaknesses)? Are we on track with both our approach and progress incontinuing to address traditional areas of concern, while also 
tackling the challenges of emerging threats? How does our level of spending on IT security compare tothat of other organizations? Do other IT security practitioners think differently from usabout cyberthreats and their defenses, and should we adjust 
our perspective and plans to account for these differences?Another important objective of the CDR is to provide developers 
of IT security technologies and services with information they 
can use to better align their solutions with the concerns and 
requirements of potential customersOur data can lead to better 
market traction and success for solution providers, along with 
better cyberthreat protection technologies for all the intrepid 
defenders out therefaced in mitigating their risksThe findings of the CDR are divided into four sections: The adequacy of organizations security postures and theirinternal security practices The organizational factors that present the most significantbarriers to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses The investments in security technologies already made andthose planned for the coming year The health of IT security budgets and the portion of theoverall IT budget they consumeBy revealing these details, we hope to help IT security decision 
makers and practitioners gain a better understanding of how 
their perceptions, concerns, priorities, and defenses stack 
up against those of their peers around the worldIT security 
teams can use the data, analyses, and findings to answer many 
important questions, such as:Section 1: Current Security PostureOur journey into the world of cyberthreat defenses begins 
with respondents assessments of the effectiveness of their 
organizations investments and strategies relative to the 
prevailing threat landscapeThey report on the frequency of 
successful cyberattacks, judge their organizations security 
posture in specific IT domains and security functions, and 
provide details on the IT security skills shortageThe data will 
help you begin to assess: Whether, to what extent, and how urgently changes areneeded in your organization Specific countermeasures that should be added tosupplement your existing defenses2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report4Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupIntroductionSection 2: Perceptions and ConcernsNavigating This ReportWe encourage you to read the CDR from cover to cover, as its

from establishing baseline security postures to determining 
the types of cyberthreats and obstacles to security that most 
concern todays organizationsThe survey respondents weigh 
in on the most alarming cyberthreats, barriers to establishing 
effective defenses, and high\-profile issues such as ransomware 
and cloud application securityWe also look at how IT security 
training and professional certification can help enterprises 
address the serious shortfall in skilled IT security staffThese 
appraisals will help you think about how your organization can 
best improve your cyberthreat defenses going forwardSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsYour organization can ill afford to stand still when it comes to 
maintaining effective cyberthreat defensesYour IT security 
team must keep pace with changes occurring in business, 
technology, and threat landscapesThis section of the survey 
provides data on the direction of IT security budgets, and on 
current and planned investments in network security, endpoint 
security, application and data security, security management 
and operations, and identity and access managementYou will 
be able to compare your organizations investment decisions 
against the broad sample and get a sense of what hot 
technologies your peers are deployingSection 4: Practices and StrategiesMitigating todays cyberthreat risks takes more than investing 
in the right technologiesYou must ensure those technologies 
are deployed optimally, configured correctly, and monitored 
adequately to give your organization a fighting chance to avoid 
being a front\-page news storyIn the final section of the survey 
our respondents provide information on how they are deploying 
and using leading\-edge technologies and services for tasks such 
as strengthening application security and protecting employees

a successful cyberattack within the last 12 monthsThats down 
a touch from the previous years record high of 86 2%, but 
still substantially larger than in any of the prior seven years of 
this surveyThe number of organizations suffering six or more 
successful attacks set a new record of 40 7%That contrasts with 
only 16 2% eight years ago (see Figures 1 and 2\)In the course of this report, we will explore many reasons why 
the pressure on IT security teams has remained so strongA short summary of the cybersecuritylandscape over the past year: gale\-forcewinds continue It isnt a matter of money: IT security budgets have continued 
to grow in most places, albeit at a slightly slower rate than in 
previous years (page 24\)In fact, lack of budget ranks near the 
bottom of the list of factors that inhibit security teams from 
adequately defending against cyberthreats (page 24\)However, the typical organizations attack surface continues 
to expand, driven primarily by the effects of the COVID\-19 
pandemicSecurity teams must work hard to protect more 
employees working from home (page 52\), protect more software 
in hybrid cloud environments (page 28\), and build better security 
into web and mobile applications (page 19\)At the same time,

popularity (for cybercriminals) of double extortion ransomware, 
which not only encrypts data but also exfiltrates it to the web 
(where it can be published), and vulnerabilities in the Log4j 
utility from Apache, which could potentially affect 3 billion 
devices and applicationsAnd the pressure cant be relieved by hiring, since the vast 
majority (84 1%) of organizations are already experiencing a 
shortfall in IT security personnel (page 15\)But dont give up hopeWe will also review the technologies 
that organizations are planning to implement in areas such 
as network, endpoint, application, and identity security 
(pages 36\-45\) and how organizations can use security training 
and certifications to move junior security professionals into 
more\-advanced roles (page 30\)Now, back to our data about successful cyberattacks in the past yearOf the seven major industries surveyed for this report, education

than not in the next 12 months.Expectations about successful cyberattacks over the coming 12 
months reached a new high in this years surveyThe number of 
respondents indicating that such an attack was either somewhat 
likely or very likely edged up from 75 6% to 76 1%In addition, 
the mix between those two views shifted for the worseThe 
percentage saying a successful attack was very likely jumped 
by 3 1%, to 35 1%That is four times the number (8 5%) who 
gave that response eight years ago when this survey started (see 
Figure 5\)The best we can say is that the rate of increase in the combined 
total has slowed to half a percentage point in this survey, after 
having jumped 2 9%, 4 1%, and 6 3% in the 2019, 2020, and 2021 
CDRs, respectivelyWe think the curve has flattened because 
organizations have spent the last two years putting in place 
infrastructure and processes to protect remote operations, 
home\-based workers, and personal devices (i e , devices not 
managed by the IT department)Examples of such measures 
include bring\-your\-own\-device (BYOD) policies and zero trust 
network access (ZTNA) approaches to network and application 
access (see pages 52 and 54\)Those investments are giving 
security teams greater confidence in their ability to manage the 
challenges created by the COVID\-19 pandemicIt is interesting to note that the 76 1% of respondents indicating 
that a successful attack is somewhat or very likely in the 
coming 12 months is less than the 85 3% who experienced 
such an attack in the past yearIn other words, at least some 
security professionals who were victimized last year think their 
organizations are better able to defend themselves this yearOr 
else they are just optimisticA positive attitude is healthy, when 
not taken to extremesPerhaps we should all follow the example 
of Benjamin Disraeli, the 19th century British prime minister, who 
said: I am prepared for the worst, but hope for the best Perhaps we should all follow the example ofBenjamin Disraeli, the 19th century British primeminister, who said: I am prepared for the worst,but hope for the best 2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report9Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security PostureWhen we look at expectations by country, the highest number

their ability to defend against cyberthreats across different types 
of systems, technologies, and environmentsThis information 
gives us a picture of the IT domains where they are most 
confident, and those that are creating the most headaches (see 
Figure 8\)This year respondents chose software as a service (SaaS) cloud 
applications as the area where they are most comfortable about 
their organizations security postureSaaS moved up from third 
position in the previous two surveysClearly, SaaS vendors have 
done a good job of staying on top of security issues (or at least 
are perceived that way by their customers)2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report11Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security PostureRespondents are also confident about physical and virtual 
servers, as well as datastores such as file servers, databases, and 
SANsThese are always at or near the top of the list because they 
are mostly located in data centers under the direct observation 
and control of operations and security staffsLaptops and notebooks joined the top tier, in fourth position, 
moving up from eighth in the previous surveyIn fact, this area 
had the largest year\-to\-year increase in security posture ratings, 
from 4 01 last time (on a scale of 1 to 5\) to 4 11 in this oneWe 
believe this reflects all the attention and effort over the past 
two years that has gone into better protection for remote and 
home workers in response to COVID\-19On page 52 we discuss 
technologies and architectures that are enabling employees to 
securely work from homeThe IT domain that most concerns respondents is mobile devices 
such as smartphones and tabletsA big part of the problem is 
that COVID has increased the business use of mobile devices 
owned by employeesThese cannot easily be updated, locked 
down, or even monitored by their employers, and are therefore 
less defended and more vulnerable to attacksA multi\-sponsor 
survey report published by CyberEdge in 2020, The Impact of 
COVID\-19 on Enterprise IT Security Teams Report, showed a 
nearly 60% leap in the number of organizations implementing 
BYOD policies in response to the new pandemic realityClearly, 
IT security teams continue to be nervous about securing 
employee\-owned mobile devicesThe next two greatest areas of concern are manufacturing and 
operational technology (OT), which includes categories such 
as industrial control system (ICS) and supervisory control and 
data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and devices that make up 
the emerging internet of things (IoT)These are areas with large 
numbers of devices that were never designed with security 
in mindThey are also being targeted by state\-sponsored and 
criminal hacking groups, with a few well\-publicized incidents 
related to international conflicts and blackmailLaptops and notebooks joined the top tier,in fourth position, moving up from eighth in theprevious survey We believe this reflects theattention and effort over the past two years thathas gone into better protection for remote
and home workers Application programming interfaces (APIs), which were in the 
middle of the pack last year, have now emerged as fourth\-
highest area of concernAs organizations move to modular 
services\-based cloud applications, APIs become more tempting 
targets for threat actorsProtecting APIs is likely to become an 
even bigger issue over the next few yearsWe will have more to 
say about this later in this report (pages 40 and 59\)One final observation: the security posture ratings increased 
from last year in every single categoryThis fact shows that 
organizations are feeling a little bit better about the defenses 
they have in place to stop cyberthreatsPerhaps this is an early 
sign that security teams are finally catching up with threat actors 
in their ongoing arms race2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report12Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security PostureAssessing IT Security FunctionsOn a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate the adequacy of your organizations capabilities

IT securityThe answers show us perceived strengths and 
weaknesses in security\-related processes and programs (see 
Figure 9\)Organizations remain most positive about their capabilities for 
governance, risk and compliance (GRC) and identity and access 
management (IAM)These are followed closely by detection of 
advanced threats and application development and testing,

investments in the past couple of years2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report13Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 1: Current Security PostureHowever, respondents were somewhat less upbeat about their 
organizations processes for security engineering, architecture, 
and designThat function was at the top of the list in the 
previous survey, but fell to sixth place in this oneThe area of greatest concern is attack surface reduction, which 
includes disciplines such as patch management, vulnerability 
management, penetration testing, and security configuration 
managementAttack surfaces have been expanding as workers 
use more mobile and personal devices in less\-protected settings, 
and access applications hosted in a greater variety of cloud 
environmentsFinding and fixing vulnerabilities across all these 
areas will be a growing challenge for the foreseeable futureUser security awareness and education is another significant 
challengeThreat actors continue to develop ingenious phishing 
and social engineering campaigns to acquire valid credentials, 
plant malware, and otherwise leverage human weaknesses to 
further their malicious activitiesAs we will see on page 24, low 
security awareness among employees is now the second\-most 
serious barrier to establishing effective defenses against

management (TPRM)It is very difficult to monitor, much less 
improve, the security practices of suppliers and other third 
parties that have access to an organizations applications and

risk quantification and reportingWe see many organizations 
devoting more time and resources to these activities recently
This trend is driven in a large part by the need to justify security 
investments to top executives and boards of directors, and to 
show progress toward security program goalsThe data shows 
this area falling in the middle range as far as adequacy of 
capabilitiesWe should note that our survey was conducted in November 
2021, just before the Log4j security vulnerabilities came to light

(see Figure 13\)Thats not remarkable, since malware is a key 
component of most digital skimming, ransomware, phishing, 
and targeted attacks, among others, and threat actors continue 
to come up with new techniques that allow malware to evade 
detectionThe surprise in this data is that account takeover (ATO) and 
credential abuse attacks (which include credential stuffing) 
moved up from fourth place last year to second place in 
this survey, slightly ahead of ransomware (!) and just behind 
malwareIn fact, the average concern rating for this type of 
attack increased the most of any of the 12 categories on this list, 
rising08 from 3 89 to 3 97 (on a scale of 1 to 5\)The increase was 
driven by an upsurge in concern among finance and financial

position and just a tad behind ATO attacksThe average concern 
rating for ransomware increased04 from last year, also a pretty 
big one\-year jumpClearly this was fueled by increased coverage 
of ransomware attacks in the press (e g , Colonial Pipeline), 
demands for larger ransom payments, and the emergence of 
double extortion ransomware attacks (see page 21\)In fact, based on current trends, we expect the level of concern 
about account takeover and ransomware attacks to pull even 
with or pass malware on this list in the next year or twoWe also want to note the rising anxiety about attacks on brand 
and reputation in social media and on the webThe concern 
rating for that category rose07, the second\-largest increase this 
year, lifting it from 11th to 5th position on the listWe believe 
the increase is due both to more activity by threat actors (such 
as typosquatting and hijacking social media accounts) and the 
recognition that this issue belongs to IT security teams as well as 
marketing and social media groups within the enterpriseRespondents were least concerned about zero\-day attacks, 
drive\-by downloads, and watering hole attacksHowever, as we 
mentioned earlier, the survey was conducted before the Log4j

that captures financial and personal data, including credentials 
from forms on users browsersThe data and credentials are

to access user accounts, strengthen phishing attacks, steal 
identities, and perform other malicious activitiesIn our survey, 
more than half of all respondents in education, aerospace and 
defense, finance, entertainment, and healthcare were particularly 
worried about PII harvestingThe share of organizations concerned about ATO and credential

(using Bitcoins or other anonymous currency) to recover data?2021 saw a lot of big developments in the ransomware industry 
(and yes, today ransomware is an industry, with hundreds 
of millions of dollars in revenue and large, highly structured 
organizations)Some of the more noteworthy: Very high\-visibility attacks affected hundreds or thousands of 
people, including attacks on the Colonial Pipeline (which cut 
off fuel delivery to 10,000 gas stations in the eastern United 
States), the giant meatpacker JBS (which created shortages 
of meat products in several US states), and Irelands Health 
Service Executive (which disrupted healthcare services across 
Ireland) Double extortion ransomware attacks emerged as a major 
threat type; now ransomware gangs exfiltrate a copy of data 
before encrypting it, then threaten victims with exposure of 
sensitive information as well as data loss The average size of ransomware payments increasedsignificantly National governments and international agencies finallystarted to crack down on major ransomware gangs (notably 
Russias takedown of the REvil organization) and to push 
government and commercial organizations to harden their 
environments, disclose more information about attacks, and 
work closely with law enforcement groupsWhat data do we have about ransomware attacks?The percentage of companies victimized by a ransomware
attack in the past 12 months set a new record (see Figure 18\)
That figure rose from 55 1% in our 2018 report, to 62 4% two 
years ago, to 68 5% last year, to 71 0% nowThreat actors 
continue to expand their activities, and no wonder: for most 
of them ransomware campaigns represent easy money, with 
rising revenue from each attack (see Figure 19\) and little chance71\.0%68\.5%62\.4%55\.1%56\.1%20182019202020212022Figure 18: Percentage of organizations affected by ransomware.of punishmentIn addition, more bad actors can participate by 
leveraging the growing number of ransomware\-as\-a\-service 
businesses that provide infrastructure to launch and manage 
ransomware attacksThe percentage of organizations that paid ransoms also 
increased substantially, from 57 0% in our last survey to 62 9% 
now (see the middle section of Figure 20\)This rise reflects 
several trends, including added pressure from data exfiltration 
and the threat of data exposureAnother factor is a cycle we have described in previous reports: 
ransomware gangs have noted that when they are conscientious 
about helping victims recover their data, other victims are more 
likely to pay ransoms, which increases the profits of the gangs 
and creates a greater incentive to launch more campaignsOur 
data shows this cycle in action (see Figure 20\)Over the past two 
years the percentage of ransom payers who recovered their data 
rose 3 4% from 68 8% to 72 2%, creating a tendency for more 
victimized companies to pay ransoms, up 5 4% over two years, 
and leading to more attacks, up 8 6% during the same period2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report21Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and Concerns$322,168$233,817$220,298$178,254$154,108$136,571 $139,739 $111,605$84,116$36,295$41,198 $12,762Q1'19Q2'19Q3'19Q4'19Q1'20Q2'20Q3'20Q4'20Q1'21Q2'21Q3'21Q4'21Figure 19: Average ransom payments, by quarter (data source: Coveware Quarterly Ransomware Reports).Ransom Payers

highest impediment to securityCoincidentally (or perhaps 
not), Figure 9 on page 13 shows that user security awareness 
is the IT security function with the second\-to\-lowest rating for 
adequate organizational capabilitiesThreat actors continue to 
see employees as the weakest link in defenses, susceptible to 
phishing campaigns, social engineering attacks, business email 
compromise (BEC) attacks, and other techniques that play on 
human (rather than technical) weaknessesDeep fakes and the 
availability of personal details on social media are likely to make 
it even easier to hoodwink employeesA few organizations 
have begun to take aggressive measures to improve security 
awareness, such as ongoing security training and simulated 
phishing and social engineering attacks, but clearly not enough 
is being done to educate employeesThe next tier of issues are poor integration and interoperability

percentage of their organizations overall IT budget is allocated 
to information securityAfter rapid growth between the 2018 
and 2020 surveys, the amount has leveled off in the 12 7% to 
12 8% range (see Figure 29\)Why has the curve flattened out, when dangerous threats 
continue to emerge and cybersecurity has become more 
visible to top management and boards of directors? And when 
the COVID\-19 pandemic has placed more stress on security 
processes and staffs? We think four factors are at work:12 Many of the expenses required to support the wave of new 
remote workers created by COVID\-19 involved non\-security 
items such as more laptops and mobile devices, more 
network capacity, and additional help desk support As shown on Figure 24 on page 24, the gating factor in 
providing better security is finding personnel with security

out of the IT budgetSome might want to see growth in the 
relative size of the security empire, but that growth is not 
sustainable in the long termTurning to the global picture, three countries allocate 15% or 
more of IT budgets to security: Brazil (15 6%), Turkey (15 3%), 
and Saudi Arabia (15 0%)Also towards the high end of the scale 
are the United States (13 7%) and China (13 6%)Three countries

have technology, four other network security technologies 
are also found in 55% or more of organizationsInstallations 
of all four grew substantially since the previous surveyThey 
are: intrusion detectionprevention system (IDSIPS), up 4 4% 
to 56 2%; secure email gateway (SEG), up 2 8% to 56 1%; data 
lossleak prevention (DLP), up 1 5% to 55 0%; and secure web 
gateway (SWG), up 3 3% to 55 0%These technologies use a 
variety of methods to detect anomolous network behaviors, as 
well as content and hyperlinks that may be related to malicious 
activitiesThe next three network security technologies on our list are in 
use at more than half of organizations: network access control 
(NAC), at 54 4%; denial of service (DoSDDos) prevention, at 
53 9%; and SSLTLS decryption appliances and platforms, at 
51 8%Lined up for new installations or upgrades in the coming 12 
months: next\-generation firewall (NGFW) technology (planned 
for acquisition by 40 3% or organizations), network behavior 
analysis (NBA) and netflow analysis (37 5%), and deception 
technology and distributed honeypots (37 1%)We think the last 
type of technology is especially interesting since it can be used 
to catch threat actors in the act without exposing real networks 
or dataNow lets see what endpoint security technologies are exciting 
your peers (page 38\)On this and the following tables, the first column shows the 
percentage of organizations that are currently using each 
technologyThe middle column depicts organizations that 
are planning to acquire the technology this yearThe last

The cells with the no plans figures are grayWhile advanced malware and sandboxingremain a must have technology, four othernetwork security technologies are also foundin 55% or more of organizations We start by examining network security technologies (see Table 1\)
For the last several years, the one that has been most widely 
used is advanced malware detection and sandboxing (in use in
59 7% or organizations)The ubiquity of this technology (or really, 
group of technologies) is not surprising, given that malware 
concerns our respondents more than any other type of threat 
(as shown in Figure 13 on page 17\)However, this area is subject to a continuous arms raceVendors 
compile more malware signatures; threat actors use obfuscation 
and polymorphism to disguise filesVendors use sandboxing to 
detect malicious behaviors; the bad guys figure out how to delay 
malicious activities until after the sandboxes stop detecting

acquisition plans for endpoint security technologiesAs with 
Table 1, percentages in dark blue indicate a higher frequency 
of adoption and greater likelihood of acquisition, while lighter 
blues correspond to less\-popular optionsIn this survey we made a significant change to our endpoint 
security technology categories, replacing advanced anti\-virus 
with endpoint protection platform (EPP) and endpoint detection 
and response (EDR)This update reflects the evolution of this 
technology area and current industry terminologyThe most widely installed endpoint security technology 
continues to be basic anti\-virus and anti\-malware solutions 
based primarily on threat signaturesDespite continued reports 
that anti\-virus is dead, old but still dangerous viruses and 
Trojans continue to circulate, and security groups see value 
in products that detect and block themThat may be why the 
percentage of organizations currently using this technology 
actually increased 3 7%, from 70 5% in the previous survey to 
74 2% in this oneBroadly speaking, EPP products provide traditional anti\-virus 
features enhanced by an array of newer capabilities such as 
machine learning, endpoint activity monitoring, and sandboxing
Collectively, they overcome many of the tricks and techniques 
malware developers use to evade detectionEDR solutions 
may include certain EPP features, but they also offer tools to 
help security teams aggregate and analyze endpoint data and 
respond to campaigns that involve malware2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report38Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsThe other technologies in use at more than half of the surveyed 
organizations are data loss or lead prevention (DLP), at 56 6%, 
and disk encryption, at 53 3%The endpoint security solution most often planned for 
acquisition in the coming year is deception technology and 
honeypotsAs we mentioned in reference to network security, 
this can be used to catch threat actors in the act without 
exposing sensitive dataThis solution not only prevents data 
breaches in the short run, it also derails and misinforms attackers 
and collects intelligence on the tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) of threat actorsThere is also a psychological 
element: many security organizations welcome the chance to 
gain an advantage over attackers instead of always being at a 
disadvantageNow its time to explore application\- and data\-centric security 
technologies (see page 40\)Our respondents reported EDR solutions inuse at 57 6% of organizations, and EPPproducts installed at 55 3%These numberssuggest that many organizations use bothEDR and EPP technologies and basic anti\-virus 
packages as well on their endpoints Our respondents reported EDR solutions in use at 57 6% of 
organizations, and EPP products installed at 55 3%These 
numbers suggest that many organizations use both EDR and EPP 
technologies and basic anti\-virus packages as well on their 
endpointsWhat endpoint technology had the biggest jump in usage 
during the past year? That would be browser or internet isolation 
and micro\-virtualization productsInstallations leaped 6 9%, 
from 48 2% to 55 1%Instead of viewing web pages and running 
scripts and apps in browsers on their own systems, end users

API protection solutions provide security teams with tools 
to understand, detect, and respond to attacks targeting APIs 
by performing tasks such as mapping the attack surface touncover rogue and forgotten APIs, blocking injection attacks 
and other exploits, analyzing attacker behaviors, and correlating 
API\-related data across hybrid and multi\-cloud environmentsAs we mentioned in our discussion of security posture by IT 
domain on page 12, protecting APIs has become an increasingly 
pressing area of concernAs more organizations move to 
modular, services\-based cloud applications, more sensitive 
data is being accessed through APIs, which are becoming more 
tempting targets for threat actorsWe think API protection will 
become an even bigger area of focus in coming years2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report40Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future InvestmentsTwo other must haves are web application firewalls (WAFs), at

glamorous segment of information securityIt involves a number 
of cutting\-edge technologies, but also a lot of operational, 
administrative, and support tasks related to roles, permissions, 
account provisioning and deprovioning, password resets, access 
controls, etc , etcYet today, as never before, organizations need to perform these 
tasks quickly and accurately, with maximum security but the 
least possible annoyance to users and minimum disruption to 
business processesThats because more and more business 
is being done with web and mobile applications, which 
lead employees and customers to expect consumer\-level 
convenience, but in an environment where nobody can be 
trusted to be who they say they are (hence zero trust practices)Who says IAM is increasingly important? Well, our data does

nine out of the 10 technology categories listed in Table 5The 
percentage using two of the categories increased 7 5%, which 
is more than any technology in any of our other tablesIAM is

balances security and convenience by ensuring that employees 
and customers provide just the appropriate amount of 
credentials and information, but no more, based on factors like 
the value of the transaction, information about the user and the 
device, and past behaviorsThe use of two\-factor and multi\-factor authentication (2FA and 
MFA) also surged 7 0% from the previous survey, reaching 56 8%
They have become requirements for many classes of application, 
and vendors and security groups are coming up with ingenious 
ideas for the second and nth factorsSeveral other IAM technologies are currently in use in half or 
more of all organizationsThese include single sign\-on (SSO), up 
3 8% to 53 6%; privileged account management (PAM), up 1 4% 
to 52 8%; and user and account provisioning and deprovisioning, 
which are up 1 7% to 52 3%The clear winner in the middle column of Table 5 is biometrics, 
with 40 5% of organizations planning to acquire or upgrade 
technology in that areaBiometric technologies go even further 
than other MFA approaches in combining better security with 
increased convenienceIt is noteworthy that the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) highlights identity as one of the five 
pillars of its Zero Trust Maturity ModelCISA emphasizes that 
organizations should validate identities continuously, not just 
when initially granting accessAdditionally, organizations should 
fully implement just\-in\-time and just\-enough access controls and 
have global identity awareness across cloud and on\-premises 
environmentsWe are likely to see more organizations move in 
these directionsAnd whatever you may see in the movies, it is not possible 
to chop off someones finger and use it to open the door of 
a top\-secret laboratoryThats because of things like tissue 
deterioration and capacitive sensors in the fingerprint reader

experienced security professionals, why not outsource routine, 
repetitive tasks? Or activities that require special skills that are in 
short supply? Or jobs that someone else has figured out how to 
automate?HmmWhat are enterprises using MSSPs for? We asked that 
question in older editions of the Cyberthreat Defense Report, 
then dropped it for a few yearsWe decided to ask again andcompare the results with those from the 2019 reportFigure 38 
shows responses of organizations that outsource at least one 
task to an MSSP, and Figure 39 shows how many organizations 
were not using an MSSP at all in those two yearsAs we can see from Figure 39, only 10% of organizations didnt 
work at all with an MSSP in 2019, and that figure was even lower 
in 2022: 6 8%In the big picture that isnt much of a differenceBut Figure 38 shows that many of the security teams that were 
using MSSPs for one or two tasks in 2019 are now working with 
them on three or more2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report46Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 3: Current and Future Investments10\.0%90\.0%6\.8%93\.2%Organizations

We askedthat question in older editions of the CyberthreatDefense Report, then dropped it for a few yearsWe decided to ask again and compare the resultswith those from the 2019 report We can also see a significant shift in the mixture of the tasks 
being outsourced to MSSPsActually, the ones that were the 
leaders in 2019 managing vulnerability scans, mitigating DDoS 
attacks, detecting and responding to advanced threats, and 
monitoring and managing firewalls and UTM devices are still 
common today, if at somewhat lower ratesBut the categories 
that were less popular in 2019 have shown tremendous increases 
over the past three yearsSpecifically, 23 3% more organizations are using MSSPs to 
monitor and manage SIEM platformsThe use of MSSPs to 
monitor and manage WAFs has increased 26 0%Monitoring 
and managing IDSIPS systems is up 13 4%, and monitoring and 
managing SWG and SEG platforms has risen 17 0%Why the dramatic upswing in the use of MSSPs for all of these 
monitoring and managing tasks? It is partly attributable 
to the fact that these are very labor\-intensive activities, 
particularly when they involve filtering and prioritizing alerts
Organizations would like to free up their security professionals 
for more\-strategic jobsAnother major factor is that MSSPs have 
achieved a high level of automation of these tasks, so they can 
provide these services very economically to their clientsHowever, our data included one surpriseThe conventional 
wisdom is that MSSPs are more popular with small organizations 
that cant fill their staff with security specialistsHowever, as 
shown in Figure 40, 87 4% of small organizations (500\-999 
employees) use an MSSP, and 92 7% of medium\-sized ones 
(1,000\-4,999 employees), but large and very large enterprises 
employ MSSPs even more often (94 3% or higher)Evidently, 
even very large security groups want to save money and free up 
their expert personnel for strategic projectsOf course, some organizations outsource tasks related to specific 
applications or business units, while using their internal staff to 
perform the same tasks for other applications and business units
Probably many of the large and very large enterprises are using 
MSSPs selectively rather than across the boardBut they do use 
them500 99987\.4%1,000 4,99992\.7%5,000 9,99996\.9%10,000 24,99996\.0%More than 25,00094\.3%Figure 40: Percentage of organizations using an MSSP, by employee count.2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report47Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and StrategiesSecurity Applications Delivered via the CloudWhat percentage of your information security applications and services is delivered via the cloud?40\.6%41\.1%35\.7%2020 Mean2021 Mean2022 MeanFigure 41: Percentage of security applications and services delivered

Teams Of the 600 IT security professionals surveyed, three\-
quarters indicated a significant preference for cloud\-based 
security solutions over traditional on\-premises productsThat preference resulted in actionOrganizations made a heroic 
effort to support remote work, BYOD policies, and cloud\-based 
applications with cloud\-based securityBetween our 2020 
and 2021 reports, the percentage of security applications and 
services delivered via the cloud jumped from 35 7% to 40 6%, an 
increase of 4 9% (see Figure 41\)Between the 2021 and 2022 reports, the percentage moved up 
a more modest 0 5%, as security groups shifted from deploying 
new cloud\-based security solutions to tuning and consolidating 
the ones implemented earlierAnd the new record level, 41 1%, 
is pretty impressive, given that only a few years ago most people 
thought they couldnt trust security products outside their 
organizations data centersWe believe the share of cloud\-based security offerings is likely 
to increase at a steady pace of around 0 5% to 1 0% per year for 
several yearsThese offerings include security tools from public 
cloud platform providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, 
cloud\-based versions of existing on\-premises security products, 
and new security solutions developed from the ground up for

security? We added this question to the survey so you could find 
out what your peers are doing (see Figure 44\)The most popular practice is security training for application 
developers, provided by 63 0% of the organizations surveyed
Traditionally, coders focused on functionality and did not 
have the knowledge or incentive to address security issues
Security training encourages development teams to follow 
security best practices for architecting applications (e g , 
segmenting application components and controlling access 
between them), coding (e g , validating user input and using 
parameterized queries to block injection attacks), adding 
risk\-based authentication, encrypting data at rest and in motion, 
and other areas where security can be built into the application2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report50Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and StrategiesYou can prevent a lot of data breaches Ifyou can build good security into an applicationand catch security\-related defects before itis put into production Developers can also be trained to test their own work to find 
security weaknesses in the code and in business logicWeb application scanning is an automated way to uncover a 
wide range of vulnerabilities and defects in online applicationsIt 
is performed at 53 4% of organizationsAlso widely used are third\-party security testing and bug 
bounty programs (52 2%) and penetration testing (42 4%)Both 
encourage human testers to think like attackers and replicate 
their techniques to find weaknesses that conventional scanning 
and software testing tools wont detectBounty programs are 
economical and can enlist a large number of freelance testers, 
but the participants get to choose what they test, so they may 
not cover all features of an applicationPenetration testing, either 
by internal staff or service providers, is more expensive, but the 
testers activities can be directed to ensure complete coverageFinally, developmentsecurityoperations (DevSecOps) 
practices, in use in 49 1% of organizations, ensure that software 
code is tested early and continuously during the application 
development processIn the 2021 CDR we asked respondents 
about the benefits of DevSecOps practicesThey cited increased

you add in similar figures for other countries around the world

technologies and architectures enterprises are deploying to cope 
with this imperative (see Figure 45\)2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report52Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and StrategiesThe top two responses, each selected by about half the

(VPN) technology (49 7%)Anti\-virus and various flavors of 
endpoint detection and response solutions are still considered 
key elements in a defense\-in\-depth strategy, and are likely to 
retain that status well into the futureHowever, we think the use 
of VPNs may fall off in coming years as organizations adopt a 
variety of alternative network encryption methods that are easier 
to manageSoftware\-defined wide area networks (SD\-WANs) are used by 
43 5% of organizations to help protect home workersBesides 
ensuring that network traffic from remote locations travels 
over encrypted channels, many SD\-WAN products contribute 
to security with built\-in firewall, intrusion detection, and 
anti\-malware featuresNetwork access control (NAC) and mobile device and application 
management (MDMMAM) solutions are deployed by 42 8% 
and 40 5% or the organizations in our survey, respectivelyThese 
technologies prevent unauthorized connections to networks by 
enforcing access control policies, supporting advanced forms of

Report is a look at deployment plans for six emerging technologies 
and architectural approaches to security (see Figure 46\)The technology at the top of the list for currently in production 
plus implementation in progress is software\-defined wide 
area network (SD\-WAN)SD\-WAN products allow enterprises to 
replace dozens or hundreds of individually configured routersand expensive MPLS circuits with simple broadband connections 
to the internetBesides cutting networking costs, they 
dynamically route high\-priority traffic to faster links and provide 
higher levels of redundancyTo strengthen security, they encrypt 
network traffic and sometimes enforce firewall and intrusion 
prevention rulesWith all these advantages, it is not surprising 
that SD\-WANs are in production or being implemented in four 
out of five organizations (81 9%)2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report54Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and StrategiesThese emerging technologies and architecturescan help your organization move toward moreintegrated, effective, and economical IT securityIf you are not familiar with any of them, we hopethis report will prompt you to investigate Second on this list is hardware\-based and firmware security, 
which is in production or implementation stages at 78 6% of 
organizationsThis category refers to security features that 
are embedded in chips or firmware, and therefore cannot 
be tampered with even if attackers take control of operating 
systems and hypervisorsHardware\-based and firmware security 
features can check at bootup to make sure operating systems 
and other software modules have not been corrupted or 
changedThey can also securely store cryptographic keys and 
provide cryptographic services to applicationsZero trust network access is also being implemented or used 
in more than three\-quarters (77 0%) of organizationsZTNA 
is a security framework that reduces network security risks by 
removing implicit trust of users on LANs and internal networks 
and enforcing strict user and device authentication for everyone
Also, ZTNA solutions restrict users to only the applications and 
systems to which they have been explicitly granted accessZTNA 
is proving very popularBetween the last survey and this one, the 
currently in production figure for ZTNA rose 6 3%, from 30 2% 
to 36 5%Passwordless authentication is currently in production or 
being implemented in 73 0% of organizationsThis solution 
involves technologies and standards that provide effective, 
convenient authentication without the use of passwords 
or other memorized credentialsAuthentication factors can 
include one\-time codes sent to smartphones, hardware tokens, 
fingerprints, facial features, voices, retinal patterns, behavioral 
patterns, gestures, and even pressure on keyboard keys
Passwordless authentication techniques significantly reduce 
security risks (including the use of passwords for multiple 
accounts) and lower the costs of password reset and other 
support tasksWe expect their use to growSecure access service edge (SASE) is a cloud architecture that 
combines SD\-WAN and other key networking concepts with 
security functions such as firewall as a service (FaaS), secure web 
gateway (SWG), cloud access security broker (CASB), and features 
that support ZTNAIn fact, there are so many elements in the 
SASE model that no one organization is ever likely to implement 
all of themBut the model provides excellent guidance to 
enterprises and vendors that want a long\-term plan for 
implementing and integrating essential networking and security 
services, so it is now being adopted at 72 9% of organizationsThe final item on this list is extended detection and response 
(XDR), also in production or being implemented in 72 9% of 
organizationsXDR platforms collect and correlate data from 
multiple security threat detection and incident response tools 
across an entire enterpriseAll these emerging technologies and architectures can help 
your organization move toward more integrated, effective, and 
economical IT securityIf you are not familiar with any of them, 
we hope this report will prompt you to investigate2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report55Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupThe Road AheadRussia, Ukraine, Cyberwar, and Cyber 
PreparednessThese paragraphs are being written during the first weeks of 
Russias invasion of UkraineSo far, cyberwarfare, including 
attacks on Ukrainian government agencies and banking 
institutions and the dissemination of data\-wiping malware, 
have played a relatively minor role in the conflictWhile it is 
impossible at this point to know how the invasion will end or the 
part cyberattacks will play, we can make a few predictions about 
the effect it will have on security teams and the cybersecurity 
industryThe invasion is ringing alarm bells across the world, not because 
we have learned anything new about the damage cyberwarfare 
can cause, but because we have been forced to reassess the 
likelihood that cyberwarfare will be used in future conflictsA 
few weeks ago, it seemed unthinkable that a nation like Russia 
would launch a brutal, unprovoked invasion of a neighbor, with 
cyberattacks as one componentToday, how can we believe that 
future adversaries will hold back from unleashing one of the 
most powerful weapons in their arsenal, especially if they have 
fewer conventional arms than Russia?Clearly, one likely effect is that national governments will 
become more aggressive in promoting, and often mandating, 
expanded cyber preparedness standards for both government 
agencies and commercial enterprisesThey will widen the 
definition of critical infrastructure to include not only power 
grids, financial networks, energy pipelines, and transportation 
equipment, but also networks and organizations that capture 
and communicate digital information, facilitate supply chains, 
provide healthcare, and perform other necessary functionsLook 
also for governments to encourage, and often require, better 
and faster information sharing between organizations about 
cyberthreatsThere will be more pressure on security teams to prepare and 
test detailed incident response and business continuity plans 
so they can respond quickly to the types of attacks likely tobe launched during cyberwarfareThere will also be more 
scrutiny of unglamorous but essential processes like backup and 
recovery, vulnerability scanning, and identity managementWe also expect heightened interest in threat intelligence relative 
to state\-controlled hacker groupsMany organizations that 
have been focusing on blocking cybercriminals with financial 
motivations will need to put more emphasis on bad actors 
working toward military and political goalsThere will be a 
premium on up\-to\-date information about the TTPs of groups 
who might conduct cyberwarsSimilarly, cybersecurity vendors will want to recalibrate their 
products and services toward thwarting the attacks expected in 
cyberwarfareCybercriminals and cyberwarriors use many of the 
same tools, but their targets, techniques, and objectives differIt 
is still vital to protect personal data and credit card information, 
but there are going to be a lot of market opportunities in 
the near future for defending trains, planes, container ships, 
pipelines, factories, medical equipment, GPS systems, self\-driving 
vehicles, media outlets, and first responder and emergency 
response systemsThe Effects of COVID\-19 Continue to Play OutIn 2020 and 2021 security professionals scrambled to cope with 
the sudden disruptions caused by the COVID\-19 pandemic
Their main focus was upgrading security for the huge surge of 
people working from home, often with unmanaged devices 
located far outside the corporate firewall and other perimeter 
defenses, and using new technologies to communicate and 
collaborateIn many industries, COVID\-19 response also involved 
paying additional attention to the security of web and mobile 
applications as face\-to\-face interactions diminished and more 
and more activities and transactions were accomplished entirely 
by computer or smartphoneIn addition, security staff and other 
IT personnel had to learn how to work effectively from their own 
homes, with all the attendant distractionsThe scrambling isnt so frantic anymore, but it has become clear2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report56Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupThe Road Aheadthat many of the effects of COVID\-19 on the workplace are not 
going to be reversedAs mentioned on page 52, in a recent 
Gallup survey, 90% of American workers want to continue to 
work at least one day a week at home (of which 30% prefer 
full\-time WFH)And consumers are going to keep shopping, 
studying, sightseeing, and schmoozing in pajamas (at least 
below the waist)We are expecting many of the technologies and programs 
initiated or accelerated because of the pandemic to stay on the 
front burnerThese include: Enhancing security and ease of use for remote workers byapplying ZTNA concepts Increasing the security of BYOD programs and mobile apps Improving visibility and security of applications, data, andidentities housed on cloud platforms Combining security and network management by 
implementing SD\-WANs and SASE architectures Building security into web and mobile apps throughDevSecOps practices and security training for developers Increasing the security awareness of employees and other 
end users so they are less susceptible to phishing, social 
engineering, BEC, and ransomware attacksRansomware Might Be Topping OutWe are going to go out on a limb hereThe ransomware industry 
may have peaked, or at least be approaching its peakTrue, the 
number of organizations victimized continues to rise (see page 
21\)True, exfiltrating data gives ransomware gangs another 
club to hold over the heads of victimsAnd true, the gangs 
have gotten better at finding new categories of victims (such as 
hospitals, schools, and local governments) and at judging what 
the market will bear regarding their ransom demandsBut the industry is starting to become a victim of its own 
successes, in that ransomware is now a top\-of\-mind issue for 
businesses, governments, and law enforcement agenciesForexample, national governments have been implementing plans 
to harden security for agencies, expand police powers and 
increase criminal penalties, create new cybersecurity standards 
for businesses, prevent funds (primarily ransoms in the form 
of cryptocurrencies) from reaching attackers, and mandate 
information sharing among private, public, and law enforcement 
organizationsExamples include the US governments Executive 
Order on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity, the Australian 
governments Ransomware Action Plan, and the international 
Counter Ransomware InitiativeEqually important, law enforcement agencies have finally begun 
to take direct action against the bad actorsNotably, Russias 
FSB conducted a round\-up of members of the REvil ransomware 
gang, and Europol has helped facilitate arrests in Ukraine, 
Romania, Kuwait, and other countriesThese are just the first steps, but they are significantUntil 
recently, participants in the ransomware industry were 
essentially immune from punishmentNow, they must take into 
account a serious possibility that they might be arrested and 
prosecutedAlso, CEOs and boards of directors of enterprises of 
all sizes and in all industries are putting direct pressure on their IT 
security teams to do everything possible to thwart ransomware 
attacksIn addition, security solution vendors are gearing up to 
deliver technologies that will helpLooking at the big picture, we think there is good reason to 
believe that the growth curve of the ransomware industry will 
start to turn down in 2022, or at least 2023Third\-party Risks Will Be Top of MindWe discussed on page 13 that third\-party risk management 
(TPRM) is one of the security capabilities that most of our 
survey respondents are least confident aboutWe believe that 
their concern is well founded, and that over the next couple 
of years enterprises will be paying more attention than ever to 
vulnerabilities and risks created by third partiesThey include 
risks that:2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report57Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupThe Road Ahead Suppliers, contractors, and other third parties could behacked or bribed into giving up credentials that attackers can 
use to access an organizations applications and data Equipment and software from third parties might contain 
vulnerabilities that can be used to penetrate networks Third\-party scripts that run in browsers could becompromised and allow threat actors to capture credentials 
and data from customers and employeesThe second bullet is undoubtedly the most visible of those issues 
now, because of the vulnerabilities in the Apache Log4j software 
and recent memories of the backdoor in SolarWinds software
For this and other reasons, we think that in the near future, 
organizations will expend significantly more effort monitoring 
and managing third\-party risksFor the IT Skills Shortage, Necessity Can Be 
the Mother of InventionAs we noted on pages 15 and 24 and elsewhere in this report, a 
shortage of skilled IT security professionals is a serious problem 
for almost every organization and the biggest single impediment 
to improving the performance of security teamsThis shortage 
has been getting worse, and it is increasingly clear that supply 
may not catch up to demand in our lifetimesBut as Plato said in The Republic: our need will be the real 
creator (later loosely translated as necessity is the mother of 
invention)When the need is pressing, people find answersWe 
have discussed several in this report: Training new security professionals and upgrading the skillsof existing ones Outsourcing selected security tasks to MSSPs Automating security tasks so experts can focus onmore\-strategic workBut we predict that security groups will also try creative new 
ideasRedefine security jobs to make them more attractive? 
Make better use of part\-time employees and freelancers for 
specific tasks? Recruit and train candidates from overlooked 
groups? Run apprenticeship programs with local schools and 
colleges? Crowdsource good ideas? Recruit gamers with VR 
cybersecurity games and simulations?We dont know what will succeed, but we think if some of the 
really smart people in cybersecurity put their minds to it, we can 
put a dent in this serious problemCommunicating Security Issues to 
Management and BoardsAs we mentioned on page 43, this year we added a response 
about cyber risk management and reporting to our question 
about security management and operations technologies and 
found that it is already the second\-most popular item on our listThere is no doubt that CEOs and boards of directors are giving 
unprecedented attention to IT security issuesThat means that 
IT management and security teams are under pressure to do a 
better job of explaining their work, aligning security programs 
with business objectives, and justifying investments in people 
and technology in terms of benefits to the business (not just 
by the number of vulnerabilities fixed or the indicators of 
compromise detected)We think IT organizations are going to demand more, better, and 
easier ways to collect security data and present it to executives 
and boards in the context of business issues, and where possible, 
quantify risk reductionAnd we expect security solutions vendors 
to respond by improving management reporting capabilities 
in existing security products and by delivering new solutions 
and services aimed specifically at compiling and presenting 
risk\-based data to help manage security programs2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report58Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupThe Road AheadMore Innovative TechnologiesHere are other innovative concepts and technologies that we 
expect to hear more about in 2022 and beyond: API gateway and protection products help organizations 
protect applications designed with microservices and 
cloud\-native architectures (see page 40\)API gateways sit in 
front of application APIs and perform tasks such as enforcing 
authorization and encryption policies, scaling resources when 
traffic spikes, rate limiting to mitigate DDoS attacks and other 
forms of abuse, and sending usage data to billing systems
API protection solutions provide security teams with tools to 
understand, detect, and respond to attacks targeting APIs
Their capabilities can include mapping the attack surface 
to create an inventory of legitimate, rogue, and forgotten 
(zombie) APIs, blocking injection attacks and other exploits, 
analyzing attacker behaviors, and fingerprinting attackers so 
they can be tracked even when they change IP addressesAPI 
protection solutions can also help security teams correlate 
and analyze data across multiple data centers and cloud 
platformsIn the future, more threat actors are going to be 
targeting APIs with more sophisticated attacks, which will 
make API gateways and API protection products increasingly 
essential for well\-rounded security programs Hardware\- and firmware\-based security solutions 
prevent rootkits and other types of malware from 
corrupting operating systems and firmware and from 
capturing encryption keysThey can play a part in thwarting 
ransomware attacks and detecting vulnerabilities and 
misconfigurations in unmanaged BYOD devices and in 
systems acquired from third parties Tools for hybrid cloud and multi\-cloud environments 
will be a growth areaOn page 28 we discussed security 
challenges facing organizations that have spread computing 
workloads over multiple data centers and private and public 
cloudsThese challenges are going to become more pressing
As security vendors respond, we will see more products that 
offer single pane of glass monitoring and unified policy 
enforcement across all (or at least most) of the popular data 
center and cloud platforms Better security for operational technology (OT) and the 
Internet of Things (IoT) is desperately needed to protect 
utilities, critical infrastructure, and manufacturing plants, 
as well as emerging applications for smart devices, from 
cybercriminals, ransomware gangs, and hackers sponsored by 
hostile militariesAs we discussed on page 12, governments 
have started to pay more attention to this, and even to fund 
research and development, and we expect to see progress 
over the next couple of years Deepfake detection technology is still in its early phases, 
but will become very important as threat actors master 
sophisticated techniques for creating convincing deepfakes: 
images and recordings digitally altered to present a known 
person doing or saying something they did not do or say
Deepfakes have already been involved in a small number 
of BEC attacks (e g , phone calls supposedly from the CEO 
ordering a subordinate to transfer money to a phony 
supplier)Unfortunately, there are numerous opportunities 
for deepfakes to enhance phishing and misinformation 
campaigns, attacks on brands, and many other malicious 
activities2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report59Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrentSecurity PosturePerceptionsand ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices andStrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupAppendix 1: Survey DemographicsThis years report is based on survey results obtained from 1,200

agnostic survey instrument in partnership with our research 
sponsorsThe survey was promoted via email to 1,200 IT security 
professionals in 17 countries and 19 industries in November 
2021The global survey margin of error for this research study (at 
a standard 95% confidence level) is \+\- 3%All results pertaining 
to individual countries and industries should be viewed as 
anecdotal, as their sample sizes are much smallerCyberEdge 
recommends making actionable decisions based on global data 
onlyAll respondents had to meet two filter criteria: (1\) they had to 
have an IT security role and (2\) they had to be employed by a 
commercial or government organization with a minimum of 500 
global employeesAt CyberEdge, survey data quality is paramountCyberEdge 
goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure its survey data is of the 
highest caliber by following these industry best practices: Ensuring that the right people are being surveyed by(politely) exiting respondents from the survey who dont 
meet the respondent filter criteria of the survey (e g , job role, 
job seniority, company size, industry) Ensuring that disqualified respondents (who do not meetrespondent filter criteria) cannot restart the survey (from the 
same IP address) in an attempt to obtain the survey incentive Constructing survey questions in a way that eliminates surveybias and minimizes the potential for survey fatigue Only accepting completed surveys after the respondent hasprovided answers to all of the survey questions Ensuring that respondents view the survey in their nativelanguage (e g , English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, 
Chinese) Randomizing survey responses, when possible, to preventorder bias Adding Dont know (or comparable) responses, whenpossible, so respondents arent forced to guess at questions 
they dont know the answer to Eliminating responses from speeders who complete thesurvey in a fraction of the median completion time Eliminating responses from cheaters who apply consistent 
patterns to their responses (e g , A,A,A,A and A,B,C,D,A,B,C,D) Ensuring the online survey is fully tested and easy to use oncomputers, tablets, and smartphonesCyberEdge would like to thank our research sponsors for making
