Nearly 60%of organizations surveyed reported being victims of asuccessful or almost successful BEC attack.Roughly 40% of organizations said they had no BEC attacksthat fell into these categories. But as these attacks becomemore common, organizations are becoming increasinglyaware that they can no longer count on not being targeted asa defense strategy.news coverage of the most devastating ones, is causingcompanies to reevaluate the risk posed by such attacks.According to the Osterman survey, the number oforganizations that claimed preventing such attacks wasimportant to them grew by 30% in just one year, with furtherincreases projected in the short term.At the same time, respondents also said they lackedconfidence in their existing protections and were unsureabout their ability to safeguard funds, obtain help frominsurance providers or law enforcement, or prevent theseattacks from getting to highly targeted users in the first place.Cybercriminals are aware that organizations are dependingon cybersecurity technologies that were never designedto stop BEC attacks.

This represents both the third\-straight year of decrease, as well as a seven\-year low but acloser look at the data shows this trend may be shifting.A year\-over\-year decrease in malware is always good news.But keep in mind that yearly data is often the last place thattrends appear. Think of ripples in a pond: the small areas (inthis case, monthly or quarterly totals) are affected before thelarger areas. And, unfortunately, a more detailed look at the2021 data reveals a number of warning signs.Since 2019, malware volume has been falling globally, from5\.1 billion in the second half in that year, to 3\.2 billion in thefirst half of 2020, to 2\.4 billion in the second half of 2020\.But in June 2021, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchersnoted that malware in the first half of the year had goneUnfortunately, the full\-year data revealed this wasnt ananomaly. In the second half of 2021, malware rose evenhigher, reaching 2\.9 billion.In other words, while yearly data is still indicating adownward trend, looking at the data a half\-year at a timeshows that, for both halves of the year, the use of malwarewas trending back up.Ominous bellwethers appeared in the monthly data, as well.In August, malware volume soared to 537 million, breakingthe 500 million mark for the first time since March 2020\.The average monthly malware volume was roughly 80 millionhigher in the second half of 2021 than in the second half of2020 and unfortunately this wasnt due to one anomalousmonth, but to sustained higher volume overall.Global Malware Volume800M600Me

Cybercriminals are always on the hunt for a quicker andeasier way to make money. So, when it became possibleto steal cryptocurrency from a machine directly, insteadof making the machine mine coin over time, attackersjumped on board.In November, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchersidentified an Android app (see below) designed tosteal crypto wallets from victims. This malicious appis called Trust: Crypto \& Bitcoin Wallet, and purportsto be associated with the (legitimate) TrustWalletcryptocurrency wallet.43\|2022 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|CryptojackingBut despite its name, it isnt to be trusted: Once installed,the malicious app requests the user grant AccessibilityServices to confirm you as a human (not a robot), andnotifies the user that the app will not work without theseservices being turned on. Once on, this app can performclicks in the background without the users knowledge and,by acting on behalf of the user, it automatically transfers thecryptocurrency from the users wallet to the wallet of themalware operator.Criminals dont always go after individuals crypto wallets,however. Sometimes they attack cryptocurrency exchangesdirectly. In 2021, there were over 20 attacks on cryptoexchanges or projects in which a cybercriminal stole atleast $10 million in cryptocurrencies.

Intrusion Attempt?A malicious intrusion attempt is a security event in whichExploitation of vulnerabilities does not stop once thean intruder, hacker, cybercriminal or threat actor attemptsattackers get inside the network. Instead, thats when theyto gain access to a system or resource by exploiting apick up the pace: Attackers will gain lateral movementvulnerability without authorization. These vulnerabilitiesand network persistence by exploiting other, internalare typically public and published as CVEs, discussed invulnerabilities in unpatched systems and software oncea previous section. While the vulnerability is public, notinside the network.everyone patches at the same rate, and attacks takeadvantage of unpatched appliances or software that canbe used as an entry into a network. (A more serious anddangerous scenario is when a vulnerability is not yet wellpublicized or has not yet been published these are thedreaded zero\-day vulnerabilities.)What SonicWall records is detection and preventionof vulnerabilities coming both from external andinternal sources. When a piece of code that constitutesa vulnerability passes a firewall with Intrusion Preventionenabled, and the firewall detects and neutralizes that code,an intrusion attempt is counted.As noted, low\-severity intrusions are typically benign.48\|2022 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|Intrusion AttemptsMalicious Intrusions by Type

Also known as a path traversal attack, a directory traversalattack is an exploit that aims to access files and directoriesthat are not located under the working directory. Thisis done by manipulating file variables, so that charactersrepresenting traverse to parent directory are passedThis allows attackers to manipulate backend databasesand retrieve or alter database information that was notmeant to be accessible, in some cases giving the attackercomplete control over your database. Since databases canalso control access (i.e user names and passwords), SQLinjection attacks can lead to credential theft, which can thenlead to unauthorized access.through to the operating systems file system API.

Attacks Fall 10%Some attack types, such as IoT attacks, seem to rise reliablyIn April, 2021s low\-water mark, the percentage ofeach year. Others, such as malware, trend capriciously,non\-standard port attacks fell to 9%, the lowest sincesometimes increasing for years at a time, then fallingJanuary 2019\. However, we may not see another month infor the next several months or years before reversingwhich these attacks sink below 10%. While the cadence ofcourse once again.Non\-standard port attacks follow neither of these patterns.Since SonicWall began tracking non\-standard port attacks in2018, theyve followed a consistent, pendulum\-like pattern,rising in even\-numbered years, and falling in odd.In 2021, the pendulum swung back, bringing with it a 10%decrease in non\-standard port attacks and wiping out most but not all of the gain that occurred between 2019 and 2020\.non\-standard port attacks follows a predictable rise\-and\-fallpattern, weve seen both the crests and the troughs of theseattacks trend higher over time.If this continues to hold true, theres a good chance the 2023SonicWall Cyber Threat Report will feature non\-standardport attacks breaking the 30% mark.2020\-21 Global Malware Attacks100%80%60%40%20%78%75%77%77%79%87%84%86%0%22%

In networking, a port helps complete the destination ororigination network address of a message. About 40,000ports are registered; however, only a small number thestandard ports are typically used. For example, HTTPuses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443 and SMTP uses port 25\.Services using a port that isnt the one assigned to them bydefault, usually as defined by the IANA port numbers registry,are using a non\-standard port.With so many ports to monitor, 
these legacy firewalls 
cant mitigate attacks over 
non\-standard ports.Theres nothing inherently wrong with using non\-standardnon\-standard ports to increase the odds their payloads canports. But traditional proxy\-based firewalls typicallybe deployed undetected.focus their protection on traffic passing through thestandard ports.Modern firewalls that are capable of analyzing specificartifacts (as opposed to all traffic) can detect these attacks,With so many ports to monitor, these legacymaking this an increasingly important criteria to look forfirewalls cant mitigate attacks over non\-standardin a security solution as non\-standard ports trend (everports. Cybercriminals know this, and targetzig\-zaggedly) upward.63\|2022 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|Attacks on Non\-Standard PortsConclusionProactive Defense is the
Future of CybersecurityCybercrime has evolved, making it harder for defenders to protectagainst, detect and stop attacks from entering their networks. As thepace of attacks continues to increase, and the ways attackers breachand infiltrate systems continue to become more targeted and evasive,the future will increasingly belong to the proactive.Proactive organizations have a thorough understanding of both theirnetwork and the threat landscape, allowing them to adapt and shiftjust as agilely as cybercriminals. This enables them to quickly detectand stop attacks.Dark Reading, in partnership with SonicWall,offers an in\-depth discussion on how you can ensure business continuity, protectyour employees and customers, and help you maintain compliance with a proactivecybersecurity strategy.This webinar covers the importance of:Having a complete picture of where data lives and how it movesKnowing what third parties may be storing data, including cloud vendors, and how they approachsecurity, including their incident response planEmploying threat hunting to detect threats that evade existing security controlsDeploying endpoint protection to look for indicators of compromise and protect the system whenpotential threats are identifiedPatching vulnerabilitiesAnd moreWATCH THE WEBINAR64\|2022 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report\|ConclusionAbout the SonicWall Capture
