REPORTINTRODUCTIONCloudenvironmentsareincreasinglycomplex,whilethreatscontinuallyevolve.Thistrendmakes 
simplifiedcybersecurityimperativetomeetbothoperationsandcompliancerequirements.To 
close security gaps, organizations are looking for unified cybersecurity platforms to better manage 
complexity and maintain both visibility and control.The2022AWSCloudSecurityReportisbasedonacomprehensivesurveyof578cybersecurity 
professionals to reveal how AWS user organizations are responding to evolving cloud security threats, 
and what tools and best practices cybersecurity leaders prioritize as their cloud infrastructures mature.Key survey findings include:Virtually all organizations in our survey have some public cloud footprint. While AWS is still thepredominant cloud provider, a majority of organizations (87%) use two or more cloud providers.More than two of three organizations (67%) use between three to six different dashboards to 
configure cloud security policies, significantly increasing the cost and complexity of managing 
security across multi\-cloud environments.Ninety\-five percent of organizations agree that it would be helpful to have a single cloudsecurity platform with a single dashboard to configure all policies needed to consistently and 
comprehensively protect data across their cloud footprint.Eighty\-one percent of organizations have an intermediate to leading cloud maturity level.However, despite this growing maturity level with the cloud, consistent with previous years, 95% 
of security professionals are moderate to extremely concerned about the security of public 
clouds, signaling a need for adoption of better security tools and practices.Fifty\-eight percent of organizations state that they will deploy a new cloud security solution inthe coming year.We would like to thank Fidelis Cybersecurity for supporting this important research.We hope you find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing your 
journey into the cloud.Thank you,Holger SchulzeHolger Schulze
