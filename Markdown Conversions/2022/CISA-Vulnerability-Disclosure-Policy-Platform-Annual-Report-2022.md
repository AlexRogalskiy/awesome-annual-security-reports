VDP PLATFORM ANNUAL REPORT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY
CISA is excited to share the progress achieved by its Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) 
Platform that was developed to support vulnerability awareness and remediation across 
the federal enterprise. The VDP Platform launched in July 2021, and it has since supported 
the Executive Order on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity signed by President Biden 
on May 12, 2021\. The Executive Order tasks federal agencies with rapidly boosting their 
capability to identify, deter, and respond to the increasingly sophisticated cyber campaigns 
and malicious actors that threaten the security of public and private systems and data. 
In collaboration with other CISA services and teams, the VDP Platform aligns to these 
national cybersecurity priorities by providing a modern, user\-friendly interface that 
strengthens the federal vulnerability management process; increases insight into 
individual agency vulnerability disclosures; reduces the administrative, triage and reporting 
burdens agencies face; and, due to CISAs central visibility throughout the VDP Platform, 
enhances the sharing of cyber threat intelligence information and best practices.
As the first cybersecurity service launched by CISAs Cybersecurity Shared Services Office 
(CSSO), the VDP Platform has onboarded 40 agency programs and has received over 
1,300 valid disclosures, approximately 85% of which have been remediated. Working 
across CISA and through collaboration and partnership, the VDP Platform improves 
vulnerability management and compliance reporting for the federal enterprise. The VDP 
Platform provides agencies with an ease of access to a worldwide community of public 
security researchers whose skills and perspectives the agencies may leverage. 
TheCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency(CISA) leads 
the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to our 
cyber and physical infrastructure. We connect our stakeholders 
in industry and government to each 
other and to resources, analyses, and 
tools to help them build their own cyber, 
communications, and physical security 
and resilience, in turn helping to ensure 
a secure and resilient infrastructure for 
the American people.
WHY ARE VDPs IMPORTANT?
Establishing a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) enables a process through which Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) 
agencies can be notified of vulnerabilities that may otherwise remain undisclosed. A VDP facilitates good\-faith security research, 
commits the agency to respond to vulnerability notifications, and creates an environment where researchers are more 
comfortable disclosing vulnerabilities. Without a defined policy, researchers may be more reluctant to disclose vulnerabilities, 
whether for legal, logistical or accessibility reasons. Likewise, if a policy is not defined, there are no governing mechanisms to 
ensure disclosures are coordinated, leading to possible scenarios where vulnerabilities are made public prior to the impacted 
agency being made aware of or able to remediate them. 
BINDING OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE 20\-01
In September 2020, the Department of Homeland Securitys (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) 
issued Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 20\-01, which requires each FCEB agency to develop and publish a VDP. Under BOD 
20\-01, agencies are required to expand the scope of their policies to include all internet\-accessible systems or services and 
establish and maintain procedures for handling disclosed vulnerabilities, including how reports will be tracked to resolution and 
remediation activities will be coordinated. 
During the development of BOD 20\-01, CISA identified that many FCEB agencies lacked both a formal mechanism to receive 
vulnerability information from third parties and a defined strategy for handling such reports. To help agencies meet BOD 20\-01s 
requirements, CISA established the VDP Platform to intake, triage and communicate vulnerabilities disclosed by researchers. 
The VDP Platform also automatically facilitates the compliance reporting metrics to CISA on behalf of user agencies, reducing the 
reporting burden agencies face.THE VDP PLATFORMOVERVIEWLaunched in July 2021 in partnership with private sector vendors EnDyna and Bugcrowd, the VDP Platform gives public 
security researchers a centralized dashboard to search for and disclose any vulnerabilities found on in\-scope systems across 
the FCEB. The VDP Platform aims to promote good\-faith security research, ultimately resulting in improved security and 
coordinated disclosure across the FCEB. The VDP Platform gives FCEB agencies a single, user\-friendly interface for intaking 
vulnerability information from and collaborating with the researcher community to strengthen their cybersecurity.

STRATEGIC FUNCTIONS
At its core, the VDP Platform strengthens the FCEBs ability to define, understand and mitigate vulnerabilities. 
The VDP Platform triages each disclosure upon receipt from a researcher, conducting an initial validation of 
the disclosures legitimacy and classification while also assigning it a priority rating score based on its severity. 
By conducting this initial intake and validation process on behalf of participating agencies, the VDP Platform 
saves each agency significant time and resources and allows each to prioritize only valid submissions.
The VDP Platform leverages the diverse skill sets of the public security researcher community, bridging the 
gap between the public and private sectors to better enhance the federal governments cyber posture. The 
VDP Platform has a modern, user\-friendly interface that allows public researchers to search for vulnerabilities 
across several agencies VDP pages efficiently while staying in close contact on the status of their disclosure. 
Enabling collaboration between government and the public researcher community is essential to CISAs 
mission of understanding, managing and reducing risk to the nations cyber infrastructure.Since launch, the VDP Platform has seen tremendous growth in the number of participating agencies and vulnerabilities 
disclosed. As more agencies participate on the VDP Platform, CISAs insight into vulnerabilities across the FCEB becomes 
more comprehensive, leading to more\-effective network protection and prioritization of remediation and resources. 
These vulnerabilities exist on FCEB systems regardless of whether they are discovered, and the more vulnerabilities disclosed 
through the VDP Platform and remediated by agencies is a net positive. The VDP Platform increases agencies awareness of 
the vulnerabilities within their own systems and allows for both greater coordination around remediation and dissemination of 
threat intelligence around disclosed vulnerabilities. For example, all incoming submissions are monitored for Known Exploited 
Vulnerabilities (KEVs), which has led to the detection of KEVs on federal systems that were not identified by existing scanning tools.

POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS ESTIMATES
The VDP Platform offers agencies significant cost and time savings. Despite its 
cybersecurity value for agencies, implementing a VDP has its costs. Agencies 
must have the staff and resources available to manage the handling of disclosed 
vulnerabilities (e.g triaging, researcher correspondence). Additionally, agencies 
would need to devote significant staff time to collecting and reporting the various 
metrics to CISA as required by BOD 20\-01\. The VDP Platform helps agencies 
meet BOD 20\-01s requirements more efficiently through the following: 
 The VDP Platform triage service reviews and prioritizes all submissions, 
escalating valid and unique disclosures to agencies. The triage team manages 
researcher correspondence and offers agencies preliminary remediation advice.
 The VDP Platform automatically reports required BOD 20\-01 metrics to CISA 
through CyberScope on behalf of agencies, saving agencies significant staff time.
 Participating agencies receive vulnerability disclosure reports from an 
international researcher communityleading to a significant increase in 
the number of valid vulnerabilities being identified and remediated. 
IMPACT AND SEVERITY OF THE TOP VULNERABILITY TYPES
Federal agencies safeguard vast 
amounts of sensitive data and are 
responsible for ensuring continuity of 
government. The potential damage 
caused by any of the vulnerabilities 
identified, particularly those 
categorized as Critical and Severe, 
could be catastrophic, widespread 
and largely incalculable.
Through December 2022, the 
VDP Platform has facilitated the 
remediation of 1,119 vulnerabilities 
out of 1,330 unique, validated 
submissions. Had a single one of 
the 1,119 remediated vulnerabilities 
been exploited, resulting in a full 
data breach, the federal government 
may have spent an estimated $4\.35 
million2 in response and recovery, with 
each vulnerability adding additional 
spending on response activities.

WHAT IS A BUG BOUNTY? 
Bug bounties are events designed to provide financial incentives to invite the public to further research specific systems for 
vulnerabilities. A bug bounty event offers agencies a cost\-effective way to identify vulnerabilities and attract elite researchers 
from across the world that agencies may not otherwise normally or practically engage. Bug bounties are an optional feature 
of the VDP Platform and are not required by BOD 20\-01\. Agencies determine the payment amount and fund the rewards 
(i.e the bounty), and the VDP Platform facilitates the agency\-funded payment to the researcher on the backend.
Supports agencies ability to 
intake, triage and track the 
remediation of vulnerabilities.
Facilitates and tracks bounty 
payments to reporters, based on 
agency\-defined bug bounty policies. 
Promotes the agencys bug 
bounty launch with researchers.
Allows agencies to scope and
alter their individual bug bounties 
and assists in developing scopes 
and rules of engagement.
Attracts an elite tier of 
vetted researchers.
Publishes bug bounty
rules of engagement for 
participating agencies.
Connects agencies with the full weight 
of CISAs capabilities and resources 
towards vulnerability identification.
Supports agencies in 
establishing and publicizing a 
market\-competitive bounty table. 
Helps agencies with managing 
the researcher community.

HOW THE VDP PLATFORM SUPPORTS BUG BOUNTIES
The bug bounty functionality enables agencies to take full advantage of the VDP Platforms vulnerability management 
offerings and augments agency\-specific vulnerability disclosure processes. Likewise, given the financial awards 
offered as incentive, bug bounties tend to draw elite researchers to enhance the volume and quality of vulnerability 
reporting. Agencies maximize the value of their bug bounties with help from the VDP Platform, which:

THE VDP PLATFORM BUG BOUNTY PILOT 
Leveraging the VDP Platform, DHS launched the Hack 
DHS Bug Bounty Event pilot, a crowd\-sourced bug bounty 
that incentivized the researcher community to search for 
vulnerabilities in certain DHS systems. Top researchers from 
around the world participated and disclosed vulnerabilities 
on DHS systems to DHS staff, who then began the 
remediation process. These uniquely skilled researchers 
identified vulnerabilities that traditional testing methods 
missed. When the critical Log4j vulnerability emerged, the 
DHS team successfully spun off a separate Log4j\-specific 
bug bounty event within 36 hoursshowcasing the 
flexibility of the VDP Platform and laying a path for other 
agencies to follow for future widespread vulnerabilities. 
The events demonstrated that an existing user of the 
VDP Platform (DHS in this case) could activate the VDP 
Platforms bug bounty functionality swiftly and effectively. 
HACK DHS \& LOG4J BUG BOUNTY HIGHLIGHTS
Tracked the remediation of all vulnerabilities 
within 48 hours or logged them into a longer\-term 
action planning process, a rapid pace that led to 
several instances of findings being retested.
Demonstrated how federal agencies can handle 
vulnerability management across a federated 
environment, triage vulnerabilities and promptly 
connect with teams on remediation.
Engaged a global public researcher 
community and the VDP Platform 
received strong positive reviews.
