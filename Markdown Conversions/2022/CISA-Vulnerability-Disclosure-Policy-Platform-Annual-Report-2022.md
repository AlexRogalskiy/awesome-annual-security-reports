We connect our stakeholdersinindustryandgovernmenttoeachotherandtoresources,analyses,andCISA is excited to share the progress achieved by its Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)tools to help them build their own cyber,Platform that was developed to support vulnerability awareness and remediation acrosscommunications, and physical securitythe federal enterprise. The VDP Platform launched in July 2021, and it has since supportedand resilience, in turn helping to ensurethe Executive Order on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity signed by President Bidena secure and resilient infrastructure foron May 12, 2021\. The Executive Order tasks federal agencies with rapidly boosting theirthe American people.capability to identify, deter, and respond to the increasingly sophisticated cyber campaignsand malicious actors that threaten the security of public and private systems and data.In collaboration with other CISA services and teams, the VDP Platform aligns to thesenational cybersecurity priorities by providing a modern, user\-friendly interface thatstrengthens the federal vulnerability management process; increases insight intoindividual agency vulnerability disclosures; reduces the administrative, triage and reportingburdens agencies face; and, due to CISAs central visibility throughout the VDP Platform,enhances the sharing of cyber threat intelligence information and best practices.As the first cybersecurity service launched by CISAs Cybersecurity Shared Services Office(CSSO), the VDP Platform has onboarded 40 agency programs and has received over1,300 valid disclosures, approximately 85% of which have been remediated. Workingacross CISA and through collaboration and partnership, the VDP Platform improvesvulnerability management and compliance reporting for the federal enterprise. The VDPPlatform provides agencies with an ease of access to a worldwide community of publicsecurity researchers whose skills and perspectives the agencies may leverage.VDP PLATFORM ANNUAL REPORT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY1VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICY BACKGROUNDWHY ARE VDPs IMPORTANT?Establishing a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) enables a process through which Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB)agencies can be notified of vulnerabilities that may otherwise remain undisclosed. A VDP facilitates good\-faith security research,commits the agency to respond to vulnerability notifications, and creates an environment where researchers are morecomfortable disclosing vulnerabilities. Without a defined policy, researchers may be more reluctant to disclose vulnerabilities,whether for legal, logistical or accessibility reasons. Likewise, if a policy is not defined, there are no governing mechanisms toensure disclosures are coordinated, leading to possible scenarios where vulnerabilities are made public prior to the impactedagency being made aware of or able to remediate themBINDING OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE 20\-01In September 2020, the Department of Homeland Securitys (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)issued Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 20\-01, which requires each FCEB agency to develop and publish a VDP. Under BOD20\-01, agencies are required to expand the scope of their policies to include all internet\-accessible systems or services andestablish and maintain procedures for handling disclosed vulnerabilities, including how reports will be tracked to resolution andremediation activities will be coordinatedDuring the development of BOD 20\-01, CISA identified that many FCEB agencies lacked both a formal mechanism to receivevulnerability information from third parties and a defined strategy for handling such reports. To help agencies meet BOD 20\-01srequirements, CISA established the VDP Platform to intake, triage and communicate vulnerabilities disclosed by researchers.The VDP Platform also automatically facilitates the compliance reporting metrics to CISA on behalf of user agencies, reducing thereporting burden agencies faceTHE VDP PLATFORM 
OVERVIEWLaunched in July 2021 in partnership with private sector vendors EnDyna and Bugcrowd, the VDP Platform gives publicsecurity researchers a centralized dashboard to search for and disclose any vulnerabilities found on in\-scope systems acrossthe FCEB. The VDP Platform aims to promote good\-faith security research, ultimately resulting in improved security andcoordinated disclosure across the FCEB. The VDP Platform gives FCEB agencies a single, user\-friendly interface for intakingvulnerability information from and collaborating with the researcher community to strengthen their cybersecurityResearcher Easy access to participating agencies VDPs through VDP Platform dashboard Searches for vulnerabilities and submits reports through the VDP PlatformAgency Receives alert from the VDP Platform on vulnerability submission Receives triaged report from Bugcrowd and validates it Remediates valid vulnerability reportsTriage Service Triages report Sends to agency for validation Coordinates with researcher2VDP PLATFORM ANNUAL REPORT PLATFORM OVERVIEWHOW THE VDP PLATFORM SUPPORTS AGENCIES!Harnesses the public researcher communityIntakes, triages and communicatesto find vulnerabilities that traditionalvulnerability disclosure informationscanning technologies may miss.on behalf of agencies.Enhances the visibilityof agency VDPs with theresearcher community.Facilitates BOD 20\-01 reportingProvides agencies the functionality toReduces agency costs by offeringand automatically generates andestablish a bug bounty, including the facilitationthe service free of chargesubmits required metrics.and tracking of payments to researchers.through February 2025\.Offers access to a full suite of softwareintegrations, including JIRA, Slack,ServiceNow, Trello and GitHub.STRATEGIC FUNCTIONSAt its core, the VDP Platform strengthens the FCEBs ability to define, understand and mitigate vulnerabilities.The VDP Platform triages each disclosure upon receipt from a researcher, conducting an initial validation ofthe disclosures legitimacy and classification while also assigning it a priority rating score based on its severity.By conducting this initial intake and validation process on behalf of participating agencies, the VDP Platformsaves each agency significant time and resources and allows each to prioritize only valid submissions.The VDP Platform leverages the diverse skill sets of the public security researcher community, bridging thegap between the public and private sectors to better enhance the federal governments cyber posture. TheVDP Platform has a modern, user\-friendly interface that allows public researchers to search for vulnerabilitiesacross several agencies VDP pages efficiently while staying in close contact on the status of their disclosure.Enabling collaboration between government and the public researcher community is essential to CISAsmission of understanding, managing and reducing risk to the nations cyber infrastructure.VDP PLATFORM ANNUAL REPORT PLATFORM OVERVIEW3VDP PLATFORM INSIGHTSSince launch, the VDP Platform has seen tremendous growth in the number of participating agencies and vulnerabilitiesdisclosed. As more agencies participate on the VDP Platform, CISAs insight into vulnerabilities across the FCEB becomesmore comprehensive, leading to more\-effective network protection and prioritization of remediation and resources.These vulnerabilities exist on FCEB systems regardless of whether they are discovered, and the more vulnerabilities disclosedthrough the VDP Platform and remediated by agencies is a net positive. The VDP Platform increases agencies awareness ofthe vulnerabilities within their own systems and allows for both greater coordination around remediation and dissemination ofthreat intelligence around disclosed vulnerabilities. For example, all incoming submissions are monitored for Known ExploitedVulnerabilities (KEVs), which has led to the detection of KEVs on federal systems that were not identified by existing scanning tools.VULNERABILITIES SUBMITTED4,091
