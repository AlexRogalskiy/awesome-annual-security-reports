world. More than two\-thirds of countries have enacted privacy laws, customers are not 
buying from organizations who dont protect their data, and privacy metrics are regularly 
being reported to Boards of Directors. In addition, privacy skills are becoming more important, 
especially among security professionals, and organizations are benefitting financially from 
their investments in privacy. This report, our fifth annual review of key privacy issues for 
organizations, examines privacys impact on business around the world.Key Takeaways From the Report Include:1\.Privacy has become essential to organizations culture and business practices, 
including their buying processes, management metrics, and employee areas of 
responsibility.2\.Privacys Return on Investment (ROI) remains high for the third straight year, withincreased benefits, especially for small\-to medium\-size organizations and higher ROI 
for more privacy\-mature organizations.3\.Most organizations recognize their responsibility to treat data ethically, but many 
customers want more transparency and are concerned about the use of data 
particulary in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automated decision making.4\.Data localization requirements are seen as important but costly.5\.Aligning privacy with security seems to create financial and maturity advantages,compared to other organizational models.3Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark StudyMethodologyThe data in this study is derived from the Cisco Security Outcomes survey, in which 
respondents were anonymous to the researchers and not informed who was conducting 
the study. Using the same methodology as prior years, more than 5300 security 
professionals from 27 geographies1 completed the survey in Summer 2021\. Survey 
respondents represent all major industries and a mix of company sizes (See Appendix 1\). 
We directed privacy specific questions to the more than 4900 respondents who indicated 
they are familiar with the privacy processes at their organizations. In this report, we also 
have included relevant results from the Cisco 2021 Consumer Privacy Survey, which was 
completed in Summer 2021 by 2600 adults in 12 countries2\.1Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines,Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, The Netherlands, UK, US, and Vietnam.2For additional information on this survey, please see Building Consumer Confidence Through Transparency and Control:

Mission CriticalPrivacy has become a business imperative and a critical component of customer trust for 
organizations around the world. For the second year in a row, 90% of the respondents 
in our global survey said they would not buy from an organization that does not properly 
protect its data, and 91% indicated that external privacy certifications are important in 
their buying process. The COVID\-19 pandemic further strengthened privacys role, as 91% 
of organizations said their privacy teams have helped them deal with the many complex 
workforce personal data issues that have arisen in the past few years. Perhaps it is not 
surprising then that 92% of organizations said that respecting privacy is integral to their 
culture. See Figure 1\.Figure 1 . Privacy's Overall ImportanceOur customers would not buy

Privacy legislation continues to be very well received around the world. These laws play 
an important role in providing assurances that governments and organizations are being 
held accountable for how they manage personal data, and over two\-thirds (128 of 194\) of 
countries now have privacy laws in place1\. Even though complying with these laws often 
involves significant effort and cost (e.g cataloging data, maintaining records of processing 
activities, implementing controls privacy by design, responding to user requests), 
organizations recognize the positive impact on their organizations. Eighty\-three percent of 
all corporate respondents said privacy laws have had a positive impact, 14% were neutral,1 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development5Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Studyand only 3% indicated the laws have had a negative impact. Despite the additional complexity 
brought on by more legislation over the past year, this result is even more positive than in last 
years survey (where respondents were 79% positive, 7% negative). Also noteworthy is how 
strong this is across the world. Many geographies, including Philippines, Mexico, Thailand, 
Indonesia, China, and Vietnam, had 90% or more of respondents saying privacy regulation 
has had a positive impact, and every geography in our survey had at least two\-thirds of 
respondents indicating the same. See Figure 2\. As discussed in our previous reports, both 
consumers and organizations expect and value a strong governmental role in protecting 
privacy. The regulations can provide a more consistent standard of care, greater clarity on the 
rights and recourses of data owners, and guidelines as to what data processing activities are 
permitted or prohibited.Figure 2 . Impact of Privacy Laws, by GeographyCanada81%

Board of Directors
An important indication of privacys importance to the organization is the use of privacy 
metrics, especially when they are reported to executive management and the Board of 
Directors. Among the organizations in this years survey, 94% are reporting one or more 
privacy\-related metrics to the Board. While some are reporting as many as 10 privacy 
metrics, most are reporting between 1 and 3, with the overall average 2\.6\. The most reported 
metrics include Privacy Program Audit findings (34%), Personal Data Breaches (33%), and the 
results of Privacy Impact Assessments (32%). See Figure 3\.Figure 3 .

Security Professionals
Privacy skills have become increasingly critical, especially among those who are directly 
responsible for keeping data safe. The security professionals who completed our survey 
were asked to define their top 3 areas of responsibility. Data Privacy and Governance was 
selected by 32% of these respondents, making it second only to Detecting and Responding 
to Threats and just ahead of Assessing and Managing Risk. See Figure 4\. Data privacy 
has become a core competency for these security teams, and integrating privacy skills can 
help ensure that those who are authorized to access data will handle it appropriately.Figure 4 . Primary Areas of Responsibility among Security Professionals

where privacy was identified as an area of responsibility, i.e Indonesia (45%), Vietnam 
(43%), India (43%), and Malaysia (42%). The lowest percentages were in Chile (19%), France 
(22%), Columbia (23%), and the UK (24%). See Figure 5\. The differences may reflect stronger 
integration between security and privacy in many countries in Asia\-Pacific. It may also be 
due to organizations in countries with longer\-standing privacy regimes assigning privacy 
responsibilities to areas other than the Security function, but more research will be needed
on this issue.8Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark StudyFigure 5 . Percentage of Security Professionals Identifying Privacy as an

Privacy Investment
and BenefitsAs privacy becomes more integrated into organizational priorities, investment continues to 
rise. The average privacy budget was up 13% from $2\.4 Million last year to $2\.7 Million this 
year. Spending at smaller organizations of 50\-249 employees increased from $1\.1 Million to 
$1\.7 Million, and those with 250\-499 employees increased from $1\.6 Million to $2\.1 Million. 
Meanwhile, the largest organizations (10,000\+ employees) saw a slight decrease in spending 
from $3\.7 Million to $3\.5 Million this year after a steep increase last year. See Figure 6\. In 
future research, we will explore where the spending growth is coming from, be it headcount, 
technology, or outside counsel.Figure 6 . Privacy Spending, By Organization Size3\.73\.53\.02\.82\.12\.32\.01\.91\.21\.31\.21\.71\.61\.10\.82\.72\.4n

The business value associated with these investments remains high. Ninety percent of all 
respondents said they consider privacy a business imperative. More specifically, we asked 
respondents about the potential benefits in 6 areas: reducing sales delays, mitigating losses 
from data breaches, enabling innovation, achieving operational efficiency, building trust with 
customers, and making their company more attractive. For each of these six areas, greater 
than 60% of respondents felt they were getting significant or very significant benefits, and this 
measure has been broadly consistent for the past two years. See Figure 7\.Figure 7 . Percentage Getting Significant Benefits in Each AreaLoyalty and TrustMore Attractive CompanyOperational EfficiencyAgility and InnovationMitigating Security LossesReducing Sales DelaysSource: Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study71%69%68%68%68%63%Respondents were also asked to estimate the financial value of the benefits from their privacy 
investments, and the average estimate was up 3% from $2\.9 Million last year to $3\.0 Million 
this year.Interestingly, the smaller organizations saw the largest percentage increases this 
year. Those with 50\-249 employees increased from $1\.1 Million to $2\.0 Million, and those with 
250\-499 employees increased from $1\.9 Million to $2\.5 Million. Benefits at organizations with 
1000\-9999 employees remained constant at $3\.4 Million and at the largest organizations with 
more than 10,000 employees, benefits fell slightly from $4\.0 Million to $3\.8 Million.

From a return\-on\-investment perspective, the average organization estimated benefits at 
1\.8 times spending, which is down from 1\.9 in last years survey. We believe this is due to 
ongoing needs in responding to the pandemic, adapting to new legislation, uncertainly over 
international data transfers, and increasing requirements for data localization (see below). 
Nonetheless, most organizations continue to get a very attractive return on their privacy 
investments. Thirty\-two percent of organizations are getting benefits at least 2x spend, and 
only 19% are estimating they are not breaking even on their privacy investments.
See Figure 9\.Figure 9 . Ratio of Privacy Benefits to Investment19%Below 1x49%1x to \<2x7%5x and above7%3x to \<5x18%2x to \<3xSource: Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study12Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study 
Returns Higher for More Mature Organizations and 
Where Privacy is Integrated with Security
It is also interesting to note the correlations between return and other factors like privacy 
maturity. Respondents who felt their privacy program was behind that of their peers were 
getting a lower return than those who felt they were the same or ahead of their peers. 
Specifically, the least mature had an average return of 1\.53, compared to an average return 
of 1\.97 for the most mature. This further demonstrates the value of privacy investment, as the 
most mature organizations are also realizing the greatest returns. See Figure 10\.Figure 10 . Estimated Returns (Benefits divided by spending)1\.921\.951\.971\.531\.562\.521\.510\.50Significantly

identified privacy as a core responsibility of their job as security professionals. Organizations 
where the respondent identified privacy as a responsibility had an average return of almost 2x 
compared with 1\.71x where the respondent did not identify privacy. This result suggests there 
is business value with having privacy and security working hand in hand.13Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study3\. Data Ethics and 
Automated Decision MakingArtificial Intelligence (AI) and automated decision\-making raise particular challenges for 
organizations and consumers regarding the use of personal data. Ninety\-two percent of 
survey respondents recognize that their organization has a responsibility to only use data in 
an ethical manner. And nearly as many (87%) believe they already have processes in place 
to ensure automated decision\-making is done in accordance with customer expectations. 
Consumers do not agree. Drawing on results from the Cisco 2021 Consumer Privacy Survey, 
nearly half (46%) of consumers feel they cannot adequately protect their data, and the primary 
reason is that they dont understand exactly what organizations are collecting and doing with 
their data. See Figure 11\.Figure 11 . Ability of Consumers to Protect Their DataAre you able to effectively protect

with AI can be particularly difficult to explain. In fact, 56% of survey respondents expressed 
concerns about how businesses are using AI today. Whats more, when asked about using 
personal data in a number of typical AI use cases (e.g selection of a sales representative, 
setting prices, determining credit worthiness), a large percentage, ranging from 37% to 55%, 
said that they would trust a company less that used AI for these decisions. See Figure 12\. 
Organizations need to do more to ensure customers understand how their data is being used 
and built trust. This will likely be a significant challenge with respect to AI\-based decisions.Figure 12 .

Data LocalizationAs governments and organizations continue to demand protections and commitments for 
data transferred outside their national borders, more are putting in place data localization 
requirements. In a new area of research this year, 92% percent of survey respondents 
said this has become an important issue for their organizations, and the same percentage 
indicated they believe it is needed to help safeguard personal data. But it comes at a price. 
Eighty\-eight percent said that localization requirements are adding significant cost to their 
operation. See Figure 13\.Figure 13 . Data LocalizationData Localization is an

to our operation92%88%Source: Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study16Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark StudyWhile this requirement is often driven by national laws and attitudes, there was not substantial 
variation across respondents in different geographies. The percentage of respondents 
saying data localization was adding cost to their operation was between 77% and 94% in all 
geographies. See Figure 14\.Figure 14 .

Organizational 
Options for PrivacyIn benchmarking exercises, privacy professionals are particularly interested in understanding 
where the privacy function sits within other organizations, and where might be the best 
fit. Across the respondents in our survey, there did not appear to be one dominant model. 
Privacy was most often located in IT (37% of respondents), followed by Security, Compliance, 
Legal, and Operations. See Figure 15\.Figure 15 . Organizational Location of Privacy Office1%8%9%11%34%Source: Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark StudyIT37% Security ComplianceLegal Operations Other1%8%Other Operations9%Legal11%
 Compliance37% 
IT34% Security18Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark StudyAs to where might be the best fit, one factor would be which model is consistent with the 
higher estimated returns on privacy investment. Among survey respondents, the highest 
average return was among organizations where Privacy is located in Security, with a return 
of 1\.91\. Those located in IT had an average return of 1\.87, and those in Legal had 1\.77\. See 
Figure 16\.Figure 16 . Average Return, by Location of Privacy Office1\.771\.871\.911\.421\.55OperationsComplianceLegalITSecurityLocation of Privacy OfficeSource: Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark StudyFrom the standpoint of privacy maturity, those where Privacy is located in Security were 
more likely (43%) to say they were ahead of their competitors, compared to those where 
Privacy is located in IT (37%), Legal (37%), Compliance, or Operations. See Figure 17\. These 
correlations again suggest there is significant business value from tighter integration between 
Privacy and Security.Figure 17 . Percentage of Respondants Saying their Privacy Maturity is Ahead of their

the findings in this research point to specific recommendations 
on how to demonstrate trust and maximize the benefits of privacy 
investments, including:1\.Continue to build privacy capabilities throughout yourorganization, particularly among security and IT professionals 
and those who are involved directly with personal data 
processing and protection.2\.Be transparent about how personal data is being used by the 
products and services your organization delivers. Customers 
want to know and be reassured that their data is not being 
abused and used in ways they dont expect, know about, or 
understand.3\.Proceed carefully and thoughtfully when using personal data 
in AI and automated decision\-making that materially affects 
customers. Designing and building with an ethical framework 
by design, establishing governance and oversight over your AI 
program, and providing transparency on when and how you 
are using automated decision\-making are all positive steps 
organizations can take.4\.Invest in privacy it pays off!Cisco will continue to monitor these trends and issues and share our 
findings. For additional information about Ciscos privacy research, 
contact Robert Waitman, Director of Privacy Research and Economics 
at Cisco, at rwaitman@cisco.com.Cisco recently published 
The New Trust Standard 
that provides a framework 
on how to demonstrate 
and communicate trust. 
This is a paradigm for the 
zero\-trust architecture and 
includes a set of principles 
for keeping data safe, 
being transparent, and 
demonstrating accountability 
via certifications.Appendix:
