I bet youre thinking of someone or something who has suffered (to 
quote the Great Bard) the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
but has the fortitude and audacity to become even stronger.Thats a perfectly acceptable definition and I applaud the spirit of it. 
But when you are talking about securing companies large and small, 
merely being resilient enough to bounce back after being down may 
not be good enough. After all, successful cybersecurity breaches like 
ransomware or intellectual property theft can do outsized harm to 
companies, their employees, partners, and even their customers. In 
the 2021 Security Outcomes Report, 41 percent of the companies we 
surveyed said that they suffered a major security incident or loss within 
the last two years, showing how wide this problem has become.Cisco defines security resilience as being able to protect the 
integrity of every aspect of your business so it can withstand, 
not just survive, unpredictable threats or changes and emerge 
stronger. As you will learn in this third volume of our Security 
Outcomes Report, there is near unanimous agreement among 
the executives we surveyed that achieving security resilience is 
critical to their business. And its no wonder as more businesses 
are interconnected today, a breach on anyone in the value chain 
can have a dramatic ripple effect on the others. No executive 
wants to be known as the one not having done enough .So, please use and enjoy this report. I hope you find it useful 
in developing your strategies and solutions for achieving your 
measure of security resilience. Resilient to threats. Resilient to 
change. Resilient to the unknown. The security industry is certainly 
not lacking in buzzwords. However, I have a feeling that the word 
resilient is going to stick around for a while. Maybe not as long 
as a great Shakespeare play like Hamlet but long enough. Shailaja ShankarSVP \& GM, Cisco SecureSource: Cisco 2021 Security Outcomes Report: Endpoint Edition3Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceIntroductionSecurity is never an easy job. But the past few years 
have really upped the ante when it comes to protecting 
a business from cyber incidents. Todays security 
defenders not only have to consider increasing threats 
and an expanding attack surface, but also bigger picture 
risks such as warfare, climate change, financial instability, 
and of course, a global pandemic.In this tumultuous environment, the concept of resilience 
has risen to the top of most corporate agendas. How 
can a company quickly adapt to these rapid, disruptive 
changes and emerge stronger?In this third volume of the Security Outcomes Report, 
we break security resilience down into digestible and 
actionable insights. (Because were sure you have 
enough on your plate without having to crack the code 
to resilience on your own.) No one report can cover allthere is to know about such a colossal subject matter; 
but weve surfaced some highlights for you to consider 
when building and refining your cybersecurity strategy for 
the road ahead.Using the data gathered from over 4,700 security 
professionals across 26 countries, we uncovered seven 
success factors that can boost cyber resilience. The 
report also analyzes exactly what security resilience 
means, why its important, and how businesses are 
ranking their own resilience.We hope this data serves as a resource and provides you 
with more confidence as you set your organization up to 
thrive no matter what comes next.Between risk and resilience, theres a bridge . We know 
the journey can be arduous at times, and were here to help.4Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceKey findingsSecurity resilience

stratified random sampling technique.Survey

privacy professionals from 26 countries. Sample 
demographics can be found in the appendix.Data

of the survey data on behalf of Cisco, and generated all 
results presented in this report.5Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceIm impressed with the thoughtful 
approach of the Security Outcomes 
Report . It provides data\-backed 
guidance on how to best utilize 
resources to maximize the impact

former CIO of the White House6Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceSecurity Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceWhat is security resilience?Whether or not you consider resilience to be a 
buzzword, its undeniable that its on the mind and 
probably on the lips of many inside and outside the 
field of cybersecurity. But what exactly does it mean? We 
at Cisco certainly have some thoughts on that topic, but 
since this is a survey of 4,700\+ security practitioners, well 
hand them the mic instead.When asked to describe what security (or cyber) 
resilience means in the context of their organization, 
respondents gave a wide range of answers. Yet we do 
see some common themes among them.Words such as withstand, recover, anticipate, 
adapt, and adverse all stand out as core to 
the concept of security resilience in the minds of 
respondents. If that sounds oddly familiar, it may be 
because its near verbatim from NISTs definition of cyber 
resilience. Thats perfectly fine; theres no such thing as 
cheating on a survey like this. But it does suggest that the 
meaning of resilience is murky enough that many security 
professionals had to look it up. Well endeavor to make 
that concept clearer in the sections that follow.Cyber resilience:
The ability to anticipate, withstand, 
recover from, and adapt to adverse 
conditions, stresses, attacks, or 
compromises on systems that use
or are enabled by cyber resources. Source: NIST SP 800\-1727Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceWhy is security resilience a big deal?Contrarians among us may read 
this section title and think, Im not 
convinced that it is a big deal. 
Fair enough. Since were not in the 
business of making empty claims, 
well back that up right at the start.We asked respondents about the 
level of interest and importance 
top executives at their organization 
place on security resilience. The 
message couldnt be clearer. A full 
96% of executives consider security 
resilience highly important . We think 
that warrants Really Big Deal status.Perhaps the high priority placed on 
security resilience among executives 
stems from the fact that so many
are very well acquainted with 
the risks. Nearly two\-thirds of 
respondents reported suffering 
major security incidents that 
jeopardized business operations .Whats more, the majority of these 
events are said to have occurred 
within the last two years. From this, 
we infer that security resilience is 
not just a big deal in the mouths 
of thought leaders or the minds 
of executives. Its a concept thats 
critically important to a majority of 
organizations around the world.Figure 1: How much interest and importance 
do executives place on security resilience?Figure 2: Has your organization experienced a 
security incident that impacted resilience?8Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceWe then asked respondents to elaborate on the types of resilience\-impacting 
incidents they experienced. As seen in Figure 3, networkdata breaches 
and networksystem outages were both cited by over half of participants 
that reported prior incidents. Ransomware and distributed denial\-of\-service 
(DDoS) attacks were the next most common event types, each affecting 
about 46% of organizations.While some of the aforementioned incident types almost certainly involved 
employees as a vector of attack (e.g clicking on a phishing email), overt, 
malicious abuse by insiders was reported by about 38% of organizations.
Acts of physical destruction and sabotage were also cited, though 
substantially less often than the other incident types.Figure 3: Types of security incidents that impacted resilience9Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceRespondents also had a lot to say about how these events impacted their 
organizations (see Figure 4\). Over 60% referenced IT and communications 
disruptions, as well as the critical role ICT plays in security resilience. Supply 
chain disruptions landed in the \#2 spot for business\-level impacts. Weve 
all been living with that pain lately, so its no surprise that organizations are 
feeling it too.While impacts to supply chain operations affect entities outside the victim 
organization, impaired internal operations (reported by roughly 41% of firms) 
wreak havoc on the inside. Brand damage sits at or near the top of the what 
keeps you up at night list of many executives, so its telling that roughly 40% 
of these incidents result in that outcome. Loss of competitive advantage is 
another top concern, and it rounds out the top five resilience impacts.Figure 4: Types of resilience impacts caused by security incidentsWhat can organizations do to avoid such events and improve security 
resilience? Well, thats one of the main questions were seeking to answer 
in this report. Right at the outset, its clear theyre doing one thing above 
all others spending money. An astounding 96% of participants say their 
organizations have increased investments in security in the wake of their 
most recent major incident.Now, we all know throwing money at a problem doesnt solve it. But we also 
know few solutions are free. The important question is which investments give 
a return and which do not. Well share what we learned about that a bit later. 
Before we do, though, lets explore the primary objectives that fall under the 
umbrella of security resilience.10Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceSecurity, after all, is a risk business . We 
dont secure everything, everywhere, or 
otherwise business wouldnt get done . 
But security resilience will allow you to 
focus your security resources on the 
pieces of the business that add the most 
value to an organization, and ensure that 
value is protected . Helen Patton,CISO, Cisco Security Business Group11Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceSecurity Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceWhat does 
security 
resilience 
entail?From the last section, we know that security resilience is a big deal among 
the big bosses, but what does it actually entail? What traits or achievements 
indicate that an organization is resilient? In preparation for this survey, we 
asked a group of security leaders about their goals and objectives for security 
resilience. We then reviewed their responses and grouped them into nine 
main security resilience outcomes.Returning to our present global survey, we asked participants which of those 
nine key resilience outcomes their organizations considered to be the most 
important (they could select up to three). Figure 5 tallies their responses.Figure 5: Most important security resilience outcomes as selected by participantsWe find it somewhat surprising that preventing incidents is the top selection, 
given that general consensus seems to place resilience as a right of boom 
concept. But in combination with mitigating financial losses, the top two picks 
target the classic definition of risk probability and impact.Next up, adapting to unexpected events calls back to themes depicted in 
the free\-form responses shared earlier. We cant help wondering if recent 
experience with the COVID\-19 pandemic pushed that one up the list.Well refrain from commenting on all nine outcomes and instead skip down 
to the last one. Recruiting and retaining security talent was only seen as 
a primary aspect of security resilience by 3\.8% of respondents. Perhaps 
respondents see talent retention as HRs responsibility or a long\-term 
objective rather than critical to a resilience\-impacting event. But ample and 
trained security staff are a critical success factor for resilient organizations, as 
well elaborate on later.12Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceAs you might imagine, experience shapes ones perception of what security 
resilience entails. Recall earlier when we said that 62% of respondents 
experienced a resilience\-impacting security incident. According to Figure 6, 
those events may have triggered a reordering of priorities.Figure 6: Ranking of 
perceived importance 
of security resilience 
outcomes for 
organizations with no 
prior incidents versus 
with prior incidents.13Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceMitigating losses moves from \#4 among organizations without major incidents 
to \#1 for those whove lived through them. Adapting to change events and 
keeping up with the business bump up as well. Preventing incidents and 
capability maturity take a backseat.You may also be wondering if perceptions of security resilience differ
based on demographic and firmographic characteristics. Here again the data 
answers in the affirmative. Well use the respondents role as the filter for this 
one to compare CISOs and Security Directors with security professionals in 
technical roles.Figure 7: Ranking of 
perceived importance 
of security resilience 
outcomes by work roleDifferences in opinion emerge right from the start. Security leaders prioritize 
mitigating financial losses, containing the spread and scope of events, and not 
hindering the business. More technical and operational security respondents 
rank those 2nd, 5th, and 6th, respectively and place the highest importance 
on preventing major incidents. Thats not to say either group is right or wrong; 
its natural that they focus on different aspects of security resilience. But its 
probably a good idea to establish shared priorities and delineate responsibilities 
to ensure everyone works as a team to achieve better outcomes.14Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceWe have the tired, deprecated notion 
of building systems that have five nines 
for their ability to stay up . When were 
talking about security resilience, its 
more towards building \[systems] to fail 
in that, if a system goes down, it will 
continue to operate despite having any 
technical issues . Dave Lewis,Advisory CISO, Cisco Secure15Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceSecurity Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceThe state of security resilienceFigure 8: Confidence in ability to remain resilient through a
worst\-case cyber eventWe asked respondents how confident they were that 
their organization would remain resilient through a worst\-
case (but still plausible) cyber event if it occurred today.A little over a third expressed strong confidence, with 
the remaining two\-thirds expressing some level of doubt 
about how their organizations would fare.Asking a subjective question like that is an interesting gut 
check on the state of security resilience, but well need to 
be more specific and measured if we want to accomplish 
our goals. Since we have input from respondents on a set 
of desired security resilience outcomes, lets see where 
organizations stand in terms of achieving those outcomes.We asked respondents to rate their organizations 
performance for each objective using a four\-point scale 
(failing \| struggling \| performing \| excelling). To help 
them do that more objectively, we provided a description 
of each outcome along with example evidences of 
what failure andor excellence might look like. These 
descriptions and examples are included in Appendix B for 
those curious about the details or interested in adapting 
these for use within your own organization.16Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceIn general, the majority of respondents gave their organizations at least a 
performing rating overall. But dont take that to mean all is hunky dory 
in the world of security resilience. As seen in Figure 9, almost half of the 
survey participants say their organizations are struggling or outright failing to 
achieve at least one of the nine security resilience outcomes. Over a quarter 
are having difficulty with two or more, 10% report at least four outcomes 
giving them trouble, and so on. From that, we conclude that there are a lot of 
organizations out there underachieving in key areas of security resilience.Figure 9: Proportion of organizations struggling with security resilience outcomes17Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceWe saw earlier that perceptions vary on the relative importance of these 
security resilience outcomes, so its no real shock to learn that performance 
varies as well for different types of organizations. Take Figure 10, for example, 
where we compare the proportion of participants struggling with each outcome 
across different organization sizes. Firms of all sizes agree that recruiting and 
retaining security staff is the biggest challenge, but the consensus ends there.We find this view particularly interesting because it gives the sense that areas 
of struggle change as organizations grow. For instance, mitigating financial 
losses is purportedly least challenging for the smallest firms. (Maybe because 
theyre more worried about going out of business than losing money?) But it 
creeps successively up into the top three for organizations with 1,0009,999 
employees. And then it crashes back to last place for the largest enterprises. 
(Maybe because they have extra financial security from high revenues?)On the other hand, some things seem to never change with growth. As 
mentioned above, organizations of all sizes apparently struggle more to recruit 
and retain security talent than with any other outcome. Thats rather ironic since 
they also unanimously rate that outcome as the lowest priority for security 
resilience. A self\-fulfilling prophecy, perhaps? Or maybe just blunt pragmatism. 
(Sure, its hard to keep good people, but Im far more concerned about 
avoiding major incidents and losses.)Figure 10: Most challenging security resilience outcomes ranked by organization size18Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceIn addition to assessing performance for individual outcomes, we wanted 
an overall measure of security resilience for each participating organization. 
So we created a security resilience score based on each organizations 
achievement across all nine outcomes. If youd like to know how we did that, 
check out the callout below. But the gist is that a higher score means higher 
performance across greater numbers of security resilience outcomes. We 
will use this score extensively in the next section to measure the efficacy of 
various success factors in improving security resilience.Figure 11: Distribution of security resilience scores across participantsMeasuring the
overall security 
resilience scoreIn addition to assessing each outcome, 
we wanted an aggregate score that 
captured an organizations level of 
achievement across all nine outcomes 
as a measure of its overall security 
resilience. We refer to that as the 
security resilience score, and youll 
see it referenced a lot in this report.To get the score, we used a statistics technique called Item Response Theory. 
(We did the same thing for the security outcomes score in the last volume.) 
This technique enables us to score organizations based on how theyre doing 
across all outcomes, while at the same time accounting for the fact that 
some outcomes might be harder to achieve than others. This tried\-and\-true 
technique is how standardized test scores are created. The absolute value 
of the score has no particular meaning, but it does provide a reliable point of 
comparison among programs. The distribution of security resilience scores is 
shown in Figure 11, with the average falling right at 500\.19Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceSeven 
success
factors for 
resilienceWe come now to the part for which youve all been waitingreading. With 
a score representing overall security resilience across nine outcomes for 
each of the 4,700\+ organizations, we now explore how to improve it. We 
approached that by analyzing a bunch of potential organizational, IT, and 
security factors to test how they correlate with stronger security resilience.Through that process, we identified seven data\-backed success factors for 
security resilience. How much difference did they make? Glad you asked. 
Organizations that exhibit these factors scored within the top 10% of all 
security resilience scores measured across all participants in our report. On 
the other hand, organizations missing the majority of them fall to the bottom 
10th percentile. Nobody wants that benchmark.Figure 12: Effect of adherence to seven success factors on overall security resilience scoreSo what are these lucky seven factors for strengthening security resilience, and 
how can your organization benefit from them? Be forewarned theres really no 
luck about it! Like Denzel Washington once said, Luck is when an opportunity 
comes along and youre prepared for it. The remainder of this section should 
help with that preparation.20Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security Resilience1\. Establish 
executive 
supportGranted, this factor is rather hackneyed in cybersecurity circles, but its effect 
cannot be dismissed offhand. Organizations that report poor support from top 
executives exhibit security resilience scores that are 39% lower than those with 
strong backing from the C\-suite. The real puzzle, of course, is how to garner 
the support of executives.Our data suggests that security programs that are tightly aligned with the core 
mission of the business have stronger executive\-level support and improved 
resilience to boot (\+32% to overall score). Thus, bridges to the C\-suite are 
built upon a solid understanding of how the business works and how security 
initiatives can make it work even better. Support goes both ways in any 
relationship, after all.While on the topic of relationships, well mention another observation from 
our analysis. We asked respondents where the responsibility for security 
resilience sits in their org chart. And for the most part, reporting lines dont 
seem to make a big difference. But we did notice that organizations in which 
the CEO, CRO (Chief Risk Officer), and CISO were closely involved had 
significantly higher security resilience scores than those where the buck 
stopped with other C\-level executives (e.g CIO, COO, CTO, CFO).Figure 13: Effect of executive support on security resilience21Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceCISOs must strengthen relationships 
with the executive team . By improving 
business alignment and getting executive 
buy\-in for budget and headcount, 
organizations can improve their security 
resilience . Good relationships lead to 
good security programs, and good 
programs lead to great relationships . Wolfgang Goerlich,
Advisory CISO, Cisco22Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceSecurity Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security Resilience2\. Cultivate 
a culture of 
securityLeaders looking to improve security resilience might start at the top by 
establishing executive support, but they shouldnt stop there. They should 
endeavor to cultivate a culture of security throughout the organization, because 
our data shows that organizations able to do that will see a 46% boost in 
resilience scores over those with poor security culture.46%difference in average resiliencescores between organizations with
poor versus excellent security cultureThat is, of course, much easier said than done. And its a fair question to ask 
what is meant by a strong security culture and how that was assessed in our 
report. We provided the following guidance to respondents to help them assess 
and rate the strength of their organizations security culture:In a strong security culture, employees are treated as part of the solution 
rather than the problem. Security staff understand their role in the context 
of the organization and non\-security staff know they have a role to play 
too. This may be seen by regularly reporting phishing attempts, potential 
malware, and other incidents. Security isnt a negative theme in employee 
satisfaction surveys or exit interviews. Conversely, frequent security policy 
violations and workarounds are evidence of poor security culture.Thats not intended to be an exhaustive description of what a strong security 
culture looks like because it will look different in every organization. But it at 
least level sets what respondents had in mind when they rated the strength of 
their security culture, and hopefully sparks ideas for measuring your own.Reading between the lines of that description, you may get the sense that 
its important for a security program to clearly communicate its policies 
and rationale with the rest of the organization. Respondents giving their 
organizations high marks on that front showed a 27% increase in security 
resilience scores over those who said their security programs cant articulate 
what theyre doing and why theyre doing it. Its hard to build a strong culture 
when everyones using a different set of blueprints.23Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceSecurity awareness is disappearing as a topic 
to be replaced by an emphasis on security 
culture, changing the DNA of the organization 
and making every colleague a member of the 
extended security family . Simple training is 
being seen as a tick\-box compliance exercise 
while communicating and changing the values 
of the organization is now seen as a core 
objective by many CISOs . Richard Archdeacon,
Advisory CISO, Cisco24Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceSecurity Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security Resilience3\. Hold 
resources 
in reserveWe saw earlier that recruiting and retaining talented security personnel was 
widely perceived as the least critical security resilience outcome, and yet also 
the most challenging. Prior volumes of the Security Outcomes Report have 
pointed to several measurable benefits tied to the people pillar of cybersecurity 
programs, and this one is no different.Surprisingly, we did not find a strong correlation between the overall size 
of security staff and level of security resilience, even when controlling for 
total number of employees in the organization. What does appear to make a 
difference, though, is maintaining excess internal staff and resources in order 
to better respond to unexpected cyber events. Organizations able to do that 
achieve 15% higher security resilience scores on average than those without 
flex resources to tap into when needed.How exactly do organizations maintain excess internal resources when its already 
difficult to hire and retain baseline security staffing? Unfortunately, we didnt ask 
for those details in the survey but its now on the list for future research.15%difference in average resilience scores 
between organizations that do versus 
dont maintain excess internal staff for 
incident response11%difference in average resilience 
scores between organizations that do 
versus dont retain external incident 
response servicesIf maintaining excess internal staff to handle unexpected events isnt feasible 
for your organization, all is not lost. Our analysis also points to an 11% average 
improvement in security resilience among firms that retain external incident 
response (IR) services. Consider getting those retainer contracts in place with a 
credible IR service provider so help is just a phone call away.You may be thinking that if extra internal resources or external IR services each 
offer benefits, then perhaps theyre even better together. That indeed appears 
to be the case. Having both internal and external resources ready to go in a 
major cyber event gives another 13% bump to security resilience scores over 
having just one or the other.25Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security Resilience4\. Simplify 
hybrid cloud 
environmentsCloud architecture and migration have been big topics for quite some time now 
among IT and security teams alike. Many have gone all\-in on the cloud from 
infrastructure to software, while some remain staunchly entrenched in their 
on\-premises environment. But which of those strategies is more conducive to 
security resilience? Would you believe that the answer is both?We asked participants if, in general, their IT infrastructure was hosted
on\-premises or in the cloud (or varying levels of hybrid models). Then we 
correlated those answers with each organizations security resilience score. 
Cloud\-heavy organizations averaged 526, while those predominately
on\-premises averaged 525\. In other words, we see no difference in
security resilience outcomes between heavy on\-premises versus heavy
cloud environments.15%difference in average resilience scoresacross hybrid cloud environments that
are simpler versus harder to manageWhere we do see a difference is in\-between on\-premises and cloud 
environments. Organizations in an early\-stage hybrid model post security 
resilience scores that fall an average of 14% lower than their predominately on\-
premises peers. In the voice of Ned Ryerson from Groundhog Day, Watch out 
for that first step \[to the cloud]; its a doozie!There is, however, evidence that its possible to make that first step into the 
cloud a little less of a doozie. Organizations that, in a separate question, rated 
their hybrid environment as easier to manage and secure appear to cushion 
the negative hit to resilience that typifies the early phases of cloud migration. 
Their resilience scores dropped by just 8\.5% rather than 14%. Whats more, 
the benefits of simplified management of hybrid environments grow along with 
greater levels of cloud adoption.Organizations with more extensive hybrid environments exhibit resilience scores 
that are statistically on par with the on\-premises (or fully cloud) baseline 
provided theyre able to simplify management. If not, those resilience gains 
are erased as the organization languishes in that hard\-to\-manage hybrid 
state. Overall, theres a 15% difference in resilience scores between early 
hybrid cloud environments that are difficult to manage and advanced cloud 
deployments that are simpler to manage.26Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceFigure 14: Effect of cloud adoption and ease of management on security resilienceFrom that, we infer that keeping things simple and friction free is a key success 
factor for transitioning to the cloud. Since hybrid cloud deployments are a 
necessary part of that journey, ensuring you have the right tools and services 
in place to manage these complex environments will help your organization 
remain secure and resilient throughout the journey.Its worth noting that the general pattern described here applies to organizations 
of all sizes. Theres not much measurable difference in security resilience 
between the cloud vs. on\-premises extremes for any sized organization. But 
both SMBs and large enterprises alike struggle with resilience in hybrid cloud 
infrastructures. One difference we did note is that larger organizations are three 
times as likely to rate their environment as complex and difficult to manage, 
meaning their move to the cloud could translate into a bigger hit to security 
resilience if not managed well.27Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security Resilience 
The challenge is that most of the time, 
security practitioners cant influence how 
quickly organizations move from on\-prem 
to the cloud . If you cant change the tech, 
the only other levers you can pull are the 
people and the process . Helen Patton,CISO, Cisco Security Business Group28Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceSecurity Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security Resilience5\. Maximize
zero trust
adoptionIn todays business environment, work is done from anywhere, which means 
security must exist everywhere to fully protect the business. Traditional security 
approaches that trust anything (devices, users, infrastructure, etc.) inside the 
corporate network cant deliver that level of protection. Thus, an approach that 
eliminates blind trust has arisen. A zero trust model establishes trust in users 
and devices through authentication and continuous monitoring of each access 
attempt, with custom security policies that protect every application.The obvious question, then, is whether we see any evidence that a zero 
trust model improves security resilience. And to that question, were glad 
to respond with a definitive yes. Respondents with mature zero trust 
implementations boosted their security resilience rating by 30% over 
organizations that havent started that journey! Furthermore, zero trust 
correlated with significantly higher success rates for 8 out of the 9 security 
resilience outcomes we discussed earlier.30%difference in average resilience scoresbetween organizations with non\-existent 
and mature zero trust implementationsA mature zero trust implementation doesnt happen overnight, nor are the full 
benefits to resilience reaped all at once. Its a journey. We dont have the space 
in this report to draw up a detailed map of that journey, but we do have a ton 
of resources to help those interested in getting started. What we will do is 
highlight some key steps to demonstrate the progressive benefits of maturing 
zero trust adoption.The first step of the zero trust journey for many organizations is verifying users 
and devices through multi\-factor authentication (MFA). Among our respondents, 
rolling out MFA correlates with an 11% improvement in security resilience scores.29Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceMany organizations continuing their zero trust journey will also implement 
continuous validation of users and devices along with micro\-segmentation 
of workloads. According to our data, those that do add another 6% to their 
security resilience score. Dont dismiss those gains, and remember that large 
percentage increases get harder as base scores get higher.Figure 15: Effect of zero trust implementation milestones on security resilienceLets look at one more milestone on the zero trust journey, this one nearing 
the finish line. Here, organizations have bolstered MFA, continuous validation, 
and micro\-segmentation with adaptive policies, extensive monitoring, and 
orchestration of user workflows. That brings us to what we labeled as a 
mature implementation of zero trust to achieve the full 30% improvement in 
security resilience scores referenced above.30Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceAt the end of the day, zero trust is a
philosophy that can be applied to any 
technology . Technology by itself is not 
enough and every organizations journey will 
take a different route to their destination of 
choice . Finding the right mix of technologies 
to implement its core principles is what will 
ultimately unlock the full benefits of zero trust 
security for a more resilient business . Wendy Nather,
Head of Advisory CISOs, Cisco31Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceSecurity Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security Resilience6\. Extend 
detection and 
response 
capabilitiesIt shouldnt take more than browsing through the latest headlines to get the 
sense that modern cyber threats come at you from a multitude of vectors. 
But if youre a skeptic and need more convincing, you can dive headlong into 
the hundreds of adversary techniques and sub\-techniques listed in the MITRE 
ATT\&CK framework. The point is that all of these tactics and techniques require 
multiple vantage points in order to detect and respond to them effectively.Extended detection and response (XDR) delivers visibility into data across 
networks, clouds, endpoints, and applications while applying analytics and 
automation to detect, analyze, hunt for, and remediate todays and tomorrows 
threats. You can probably guess where this is headed. Do we see measurable 
improvements to security resilience as detection and response capabilities 
extend to cover more threat vectors and enterprise assets? Lets find out.45%difference in average resilience scoresbetween organizations with non\-existent 
versus mature XDR implementationsTo test that, well establish a baseline for organizations that havent made 
progress with XDR or even its predecessor, endpoint detection and response 
(EDR). The security resilience scores of those organizations average 393\. To put 
that in perspective, this puts them in the 14th percentile for security resilience 
among all participants. Obviously not where most want to stay.Since many view EDR as a foundational component of XDR, well consider that 
milestone \#1 on the journey. Organizations that report rolling out EDR upped 
their overall security resilience score by 23% over the baseline. Not bad at all. 
But also not really XDR, so lets keep going.32Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceParticipants that report having the basic elements of XDR in place add another 
10 percentage points to their security resilience score, rising 33% higher than 
organizations with no EDR or XDR deployments. By basic, we mean that they 
have detection and response capabilities at the endpoint and network but 
havent yet integrated it all together.Figure 16: Effect of XDR implementation milestones on security resilienceExtending capabilities is great, but anyone whos worked in security operations 
knows the challenges that come with wider and deeper visibility. The ever\-
increasing volume of events that must be triaged and responded to is what 
leads to many security incidents that we read about in those headlines. In our 
view, there are two major things that integrate the base components of XDR 
into a cohesive solution: cyber threat intelligence and automationorchestration.Detection and response capabilities work best when they know what to 
look for and how to find it. Many look to quality cyber threat intelligence 
for that purpose. Security automation and orchestration is the connective 
tissue of mature XDR implementations. Together, they take XDR to the next 
level. Organizations with all of these capabilities significantly improved their 
performance in all nine resilience outcomes and boasted a 45% better overall 
resilience score than those with no progress toward XDR.33Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security Resilience 
1\. Take 
security to 
the edgeThe acceleration in hybrid work including a mobile workforce, the proliferation 
of devices, and the hyper\-distribution of applications over multiple cloud 
providers has resulted in growing challenges to securing this widespread 
interconnectivity that outpaces human scale. The current prevailing secure 
connectivity model is inadequate to address these challenges. As a result, end 
users and IT professionals alike face a reality where their experiences are both 
fragmented and exposed.Secure access service edge (SASE) offers a strategy to converge networking 
and security into a cloud\-delivered service, simplify operations, and remain 
resilient in the face of ever\-changing business demands. Do we have evidence 
from our report that SASE does indeed correlate with improved resilience? Yes!27% difference in average resilience scoresbetween organizations with non\-existent 
versus more mature SASE implementationsWe didnt get into the specifics of classic components of SASE implementation 
(see Gartners definition), but we did inquire about participants general 
progress in that direction. Organizations claiming to have SASE deployments 
exhibit overall security resilience scores that are, on average, 15% higher than 
those that have no plans or progress on the SASE front. We also found that 
SASE implementation correlates with higher success rates for eight out of the 
nine individual security resilience outcomes.34Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceBut wait, theres more! Cisco expands on Gartners definition of SASE to 
include advanced threat detection and response capabilities, among other 
components. Since we did ask about those capabilities, we were curious to see 
if organizations that incorporated them along with their SASE implementations 
were even more resilient. Turns out they did indeed climb to new heights of 
security resilience, raising their scores to 27% higher than the baseline of 
organizations that havent started rolling out SASE.Showing some initiative 
Parallel to this larger survey, we asked a focus group of IT and security 
executives to share their top three current initiatives for improving the cyber 
resilience of their organizations. Heres what they had to say.Figure 17: Top initiatives for security resilience35Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceThe cybersecurity (resilience) frameworkOriginally the result of a 2013 United States Executive 
Order aimed at securing critical infrastructure, the NIST 
Cybersecurity Framework is now used by many different 
types of organizations the world over to reduce cyber 
risk and improve resilience. Because of that widespread 
usage, we thought it would be useful to assess 
how relevant activities defined in the Cybersecurity 
Framework affect our nine security resilience outcomes.To enable that, we asked each participant to rate the 
implementation level of a subset of 13 capabilities derived 
from activities defined in the Cybersecurity Framework. 
These capabilities were selected by our experts based 
on their potential relevance to security resilience. Then 
we crunched the data to determine correlations between 
each capability and each of our security resilience 
outcomes. The results of that are captured in the effects 
matrix presented below in all its data nerdery glory.Figure 18: NIST Cybersecurity 
Framework activities correlated 
with security resilience outcomes36Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security Resilience 
Anywhere you see a blue square means the intersecting NIST capability 
and security resilience outcome have a statistically significant correlation. 
The percentages within those blue squares denote the increased likelihood 
of successfully achieving that outcome among organizations with the most 
effective implementations of that capability. In other words, participants that 
do a great job tracking key systems and data are almost 11% more likely 
to excel at containing the spread and scope of security incidents (top left 
square). All the others can be interpreted the same way.As with our original security outcomes matrix for Volume 1 of this series, this 
chart is a Choose Your Own Adventure kind of thing. If youd like to know how 
to improve specific resilience outcomes, then pick one along the lefthand side 
and scan across to find data\-backed options for accomplishing that. If, on 
the other hand, youre curious how a certain activity within the Cybersecurity 
Framework might strengthen your organizations resilience, then pick 
something at the top and scan down the list of intersecting outcomes.In that spirit, we chose our own adventure through the matrix to come up with 
the observations listed below. These are by no means the only takeaways, 
and we dont want to spoil or bias your own exploration. So if youd rather
not have our thoughts in your head, just skip to the Conclusion.Observation 1Know what
youre defending . . . 
and what youre 
defending againstYes, this is a security platitude along the lines of just patch your systems. 
And yes, this concept has filled many PowerPoint decks with mention of 
protecting your crown jewels and Sun Tzu quotes. But maybe theres a 
legitimate reason for that.Its hard to dismiss the datas message here. Tracking key systems and data is 
the \#1 most effective activity overall. Identifying top cyber risk scenarios is \#2\. 
That means two activities that fall under the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 
Identify function may do more for improving your security resilience than 
functions normally associated with resilience like Detect, Respond, and 
Recover. Food for thought (and action!), right?37Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceObservation 2Cyber resilience
isnt just about youUpon reviewing the Cybersecurity Framework activities that correlate with 
resilience outcomes, its hard to ignore the sense that a significant amount 
of an organizations success ties to external parties. Backing up your 
defenses with a sufficient cyber insurance policy ranks \#4 overall. Managing 
PR during the incident response and recovery process is \#5\. Testing 
essential third\-party services follows at \#6, and \#8 ensures those services 
continue to be delivered during a cyber event. Finally, coordinating response 
plans with external parties lands in ninth place.So, by all means get your own ducks in a row in preparation for unexpected, 
disruptive cyber events. But dont be left as a lone sitting duck when that day 
comes. Practical experience, along with this data, clearly demonstrates that the 
true extent of cyber resilience goes far beyond your own perimeter and people.Observation 3People and plans
have a high ROIObservation 4Its not all about
the money, but . . .The mention of people at the end of the last point segues into another theme 
that jumps out at us from the matrix above. Namely, multiple Cybersecurity 
Framework activities involve people or plans (which are created with people
in mind).One activity establishes that an incident response plan be created and 
communicated to employees. Another requires that plan to be updated regularly 
rather than simply gathering dust on a shelf (or a shared drive). And weve 
already mentioned the importance of response plans covering coordination with 
external parties. Of course, none of these plans are worth anything if response 
staff arent adequately trained on how to carry them out.There are a lot of technical solutions out there to help organizations improve 
their security resilience. But behind every single one of those solutions are 
people who configure, maintain, and operate them during a cyber crisis. Help 
your organization by helping them know what to do and how to do itmitigating financial losses from a security event is the most important 
resilience outcome to CISOs and organizations that have experienced a major 
incident in the past. Its helpful to note, therefore, that our analysis reveals 
that 8 of the 13 Cybersecurity Framework activities increase the chances of 
successfully achieving that outcome.We wont list all of those activities you can do that on your own and 
then refer to NIST documentation for additional details and implementation 
guidance. What we will do is emphasize that the effective activities highlighted 
in the matrix span governance, people, process, and technology\-based 
controls. This corroborates the theme that minimizing losses and maximizing 
resilience requires much more than a one\-dimensional point solution.38Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceConclusionSo there you have it. Are you feeling more resilient yet? Or at least like 
youre on the road to resilience? Building security resilience requires a lot of 
hard work, but it starts with a plan.As you set up your organization to thrive no matter what comes next, 
were ready to support you in developing and executing on that plan and 
finding clarity in chaos. Whether youre struggling with risk assessment, 
ransomware, regulatory compliance, response and recovery, or other 
security challenges, you dont have to go it alone.For further insights:

Security resilience outcomes1 .Containing the spread or scope of security incidents: When security 
incidents do occur, their scope is contained by controls and processes 
that limit lateral movement, privilege escalation, dwell time, propagation 
to other departments, etc. A track record of keeping incidents in check 
that might otherwise have been much bigger or recent tests that 
validate these capabilities would be an indicator of success here.2 .Mitigating financial losses stemming from security incidents: When 
security incidents do occur, their cost is reduced through controls and 
processes that mitigate their extent of impact and associated losses. 
Examples include plans and procedures to recover quickly, limit brand 
damage, reduce downstream losses to other parties, avoid litigation, 
transfer risk through cyber insurance, etc. Hoping for the best or a 
strategy of well deal with what may come would be a sign of struggle.3 .Adapting to unexpected external change events or trends: The security 
program is agile and able to respond effectively to changing conditions 
triggered by unforeseen and uncontrollable events outside the organization. 
Adapting well to the sudden transition to a remote workforce during the 
COVID\-19 pandemic and handling the subsequent trends of hybrid work 
and quickening digital transformation would be evidence of success.4 .Keeping up with the demands and growth of the business: The 
security program responds well to changing business needs and 
doesnt impede new lines of revenue. In some cases, security may 
provide competitive advantage or even be a net revenue generator. If 
security is viewed as a business roadblock or purely as a cost center 
by business execs, its a sign of struggling to meet this goal.5 .Continuing to mature and improve security capabilities: Thesecurity program establishes goals, tracks progress, and seeks to 
continually improve its efficacy over time. The program may not 
yet be mature in all areas but should know where it most needs to 
improve and have a plan to get there. A stagnant security program 
thats falling behind modern threats or a philosophy of being done 
after the next control is implemented would be signs of struggle.43Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security Resilience6 .Preventing major cybersecurity incidents and losses: We expect that an 
organization thats highly successful in achieving this goal has not had a 
serious or highly impactful security incident (high internal andor external 
visibility) in the last couple years. Furthermore, theres no reason to suspect 
that its merely a matter of time until a major loss event occurs. Minor and 
even moderate incidents are expected, but the question here is whether 
the organization has and will continue to stay out of the headlines.7 .Ensuring business continuity through disruptive events: System 
failures, network outages, and other technology disruptions have 
minimal impact on critical business operations. The organization is 
able to successfully navigate sudden and unexpected events that 
force extensive or rapid architectural andor process changes.8 .Maintaining a cost\-effective security program: Executive leadersview the security program as having good ROI. No recurring 
rumblings about the overly high costs of security. Low rate of 
shelfware purchases. Staffing is lean yet not starved. A plan among 
executives and security leaders to reduce the security budget 
without increasing risk would be a good sign of success here.9 .Recruiting and retaining talented security personnel: The organization 
has a positive reputation in the security community as being a good 
place to work. Open security positions are generally filled quickly and 
without undue incentives. Talented staff move up instead of move out 
and attrition rates remain low. Employee satisfaction is consistently high.44Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3Achieving Security ResilienceAmericas Headquarters
