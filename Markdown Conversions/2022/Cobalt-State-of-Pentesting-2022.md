Every individualhas a part to play, but as digital transformation and DevSecOps adoption accelerates, security anddevelopment teams both take center stage. The struggles and wins of one team increasingly affectthe other. Which is why for this years State of Pentesting report, we decided to focus on issues andstats that are relevant to both security and development teams: to separate these two inextricablylinked groups would only yield a partial picture of the security landscape.Cobalt is a Pentest as a Service vendor, so we get to directly observe how organizations deal withvulnerabilities and the challenges threatening their security. One of their most pressing issues?They dont have enough people on their teams to handle the workload. Headlines around The GreatResignation continue to populate news feeds, but those working in tech might argue they havealways had to deal with a lack of manpower. We began to suspect things have moved to a criticaltipping point when our 2021 pentesting data started showing results like this: Teams have been struggling with the same vulnerabilities for 5 years in a row. Most of the findings we discover are connected to missing configurations, outdatedsoftware, and lack of access management controlsall issues that can start piling whenworkloads are getting out of control. Teams want to fix all of their vulnerabilities, but end up neglecting those that arent Criticalor High risk. Most findings that get fixed take approximately 14 days to address, but there are situationswhere they take 31 days or longer.Research MethodologyCobalts State of Pentesting report data comes from two sets: 2,380 pentests conducted over the course of 2021\. A survey of 602 cybersecurity and software development professionals.For more information see Appendix B, Methodology.02THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|EXECUTIVE SUMMARYWe started to think, are teams reaching a breaking point, dealing with too much work? If so, could wecapture or quantify the impact? Here are a few takeaways from our research that may make you pause: Nearly every team we surveyed has been affected by talent shortages. As a result, organizations are losing strength in their security posture and code quality,creating considerable risk of successful breaches. Try as they might to retain their talent, organizations are seeing a lot of resignations. Morethan half of survey respondents are considering quitting their jobs.These stressful circumstances can wreak considerable damage, both to organizations and theirpeople. Leadership should take a hard look at what is causing burnout and disillusionment, take stockof their go\-to\-market priorities versus their teams capacity, and consider the daily interactions theyhave with their colleagues. Our research highlights underlying concerns, but also proposes solutions.The first step? Acknowledge that business as usual is not usual. Not anymore, and perhaps maynever go back to pre\-pandemic expectations.NEXT CHAPTER: THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022 AT A GLANCE03THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022 AT A GLANCEThe State of Pentesting 2022 at a GlanceTop Vulnerability CategoriesTop Findings1\.Server Security Misconfigurations1\.Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS): Stored2\.Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS)2\.Broken Access Control: Insecure Direct3\.Broken Access Control4\.Sensitive Data Exposure5\.Authentication and SessionsThese vulnerability categories have stayed atthe top of our list for 5 years straight.Object References (IDOR)3\.Components with Known Vulnerabilities:Outdated Software Versions4\.Server Security Misconfiguration:

Vulnerabilities?The answer to this question comes in two parts. The first step is to look at Vulnerability Categories,such as Broken Access Control or Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS). Nested within these categories areFindings, which are more granular descriptions of the specific flaw an attacker could exploit.Heres an example:Vulnerability Category: An application is vulnerable to Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Thishappens when the application doesnt validate and encode user\-supplied input properly, so it getstreated as code, rather than as text. There are two possible findings under this category:Finding \#1: An instance of Reflected XSS.An attacker creates a URL that contains avulnerableparameter. When they send that URL to anotheruser, the users browser accepts the code string andperforms whatever actions it describesfor example,generating an alert box that prompts users to sharesensitive information.Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS)Reflected XSSStored XSSFinding \#2: An instance of Stored XSS. When an attacker passes script code to the server in a user\-editable location, the application stores it on the server. When another user accesses the affectedpage, their browser interprets and renders the stored code as part of the page.Top 5 Vulnerability CategoriesFollowing the same hierarchy, we started our analysis with the 5 mostfrequently discovered vulnerability categories in 2021:1\.Server Security Misconfigurations: 38%2\.Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS): 13%3\.Broken Access Control: 11%4\.Sensitive Data Exposure: 10%5\.Authentication and Sessions: 8%of our 2021 findings are

Each of our top vulnerability categories had a spot in their 2021 list.OWASP Top 10OWASPs most widely\-known project is reporting the frequently observed vulnerabilitiesfor web applications in their Top Ten list. Cobalts reporting has largely referred to theirtaxonomy, with a few exceptions: in 2021, OWASP filed Cross\-Site Scripting under the largerInjection category and renamed Sensitive Data Exposure to Cryptographic Failures.Authentication and Sessions in our list maps to Identification and AuthenticationFailures in theirs.Whats interesting is how our top vulnerability categories haveor rather, haventchanged in thelast 5 years.20172018201920202021Server Security

If your application is missing a Content SecurityPolicy (CSP) headera type of security configurationyou are more vulnerable to an injectionattack like XSS. The prevalence of these vulnerabilities boils down to the following problem: Theressomething you can turn onbut you didnt. We typically see this after teams forget to adjust defaultsettings when deploying their applications to a cloud environment.07THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?TOP 5 VULNERABILITY CATEGORIESWhats different: Where we saw a notable difference is the rise of the Broken Access Controlcategory, and were not alone in our observations. OWASP noticed the same uptick. In the 2017version of their list, Broken Access Control was at 5th place, but it shot up to the top position intheir 2021 update with this stat attached: 94% of applications were tested for some form of BrokenAccess Control.One possible reason for this is growth in operations. We like to think of it like this: If you had ahouse with one door, all you have to worry about is keeping that one door locked. But if you expandthat house and add a garage door and 5 windowsor in our case, adopt more technology, expandsystems, widen networks, and manage more usersyoure more likely to forget to lock everything.Creating or updating your useraccess matrix can help.Top 5 FindingsFor a detailed breakdown of how to fix and prevent each of the findings listed here, checkthe Appendix in The State of Pentesting 2021\.Diving deeper into our data, we uncovered a similar pattern when it came to the top 5 findings: mostflaws from 2020 stayed at the top, but a couple of new issues made their way onto the list.20202021\#01Broken Access Control: Insecure Direct Object

HeadersFigure 2: The top 5 most common findings in our database for 2020 and 2021For a detailed breakdown of the top vulnerabilities according to asset type, check APPENDIX A.08THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?TOP 5 FINDINGS01\. Stored Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS)Stored Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS) took the top spot for most common findings in 2021\. This is avery common vulnerability across the web, observed even in web apps as prominent as ApplesiCloud. In theory, any feature that allows user input can be vulnerable, because it gives attackers anopportunity to inject and store malicious scripts into web applications.Breaking Down Stored XSSHeres an example of how it works: A web form has a field that accepts user text input, thenstores that input somewhere on the servers database. An attacker accesses that web formand enters a line of code, which the server accepts and stores in the database.The next time a user pulls up data that includes the attackers input, their browser attemptsto run the malicious code.How do you fix and prevent Stored XSS?Overall, you should treat all user\-supplied input as untrusted (or potentially malicious) data.This means taking the following steps while designing the application:1\.Only accept untrusted data input in select locations.2\.Create a whitelist of allowed characters.3\.Always sanitize input, encode output, or both, for any data that comes into or out ofthe application.Diving deeper into our data, we uncovered a similar pattern when it came to the top 5 findings: most4\.Use a well\-known and secure encoding API for input and output encoding, such asthe OWASP ESAPI, or research and use an existing output encoder.
flaws from 2020 stayed at the top, but a couple of new issues made their way onto the list.Note: We do not recommend trying to write input and output encoders, unless absolutely necessary.02\. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) were a prevalent finding both in 2020 and 2021\. This typeof flaw has the potential to give attackers access to personally identifiable information, which laterenables identity theft, fraud, or blackmailing. In 2017, pentesters found an IDOR vulnerability thatcould leak users Airbnb messages.09THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?TOP 5 FINDINGSWhat to Do About IDORInsecure Direct Object References (IDOR) can give access to resources via user\-suppliedinput. Attackers could bypass authorization by modifying a value of a parameter that pointsdirectly to an object in your database.Heres an example: Due to the way a website or application handles resources, onecustomers file has the ID file123 in the URL, which corresponds to that files location inthe database.An attacker who can access file124 changes the resource ID number in the URL to adifferent number, such as file123 and can view the other customers file.How do you fix and prevent IDOR?Use per\-user or per\-session indirect object references. For example, instead of using theresources database key, you could use a drop\-down list of six resources authorized forthe current user with the numbers 1 to 6 to indicate which value the user selected. Theapplication then maps these per\-user indirect references back to the actual database key onthe server, and returns the requested information.Check the users access when they try to view content. Each time the application usesa direct object reference from an untrusted source, the application should also make anaccess control check to ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested object.03\. Outdated Software VersionsThe Outdated Software Versions finding was at third place for both 2020 and 2021\. At first glance,outdated software doesnt sound risky or important, but recent security news suggest otherwise.Why Outdated Software MattersLets look at a recent example of a vulnerability that sidetracked development and securityoperations everywhere: the Log4j flaw. In late 2021, any team using the Apache Log4j libraryfor logging and configurations was vulnerable to a remote code execution attack. Hackerscould run code on vulnerable devices and take full control of them.Apache issued a patch to fix this vulnerability on December 6th. It later became clear thispatch didnt fully address the problem, so they released another patch on December 13th.10THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?TOP 5 FINDINGSThen another one on December 17th. And another one on December 28th. Teams whodidnt stay on top of patch releases and ran outdated versions of the software were stillvulnerable to a flaw that has been described as a a severe risk by the Cybersecurity andInfrastructure Security Agency.How do you fix and prevent Outdated Software Versions?The core of the problem is version management, which can add a lot to teams workloadswhen it takes dozens of apps and programs to keep a website, product, or business running.Staying on top of updates for all of them can quickly spiral out of control, which is why ourpentesters recommend using an automated Vulnerability Management System to scan forsoftware updates and notify the IT team when there are fixes to deploy.04\. Insecure SSL or TLS protocolsWhere we started to see year\-over\-year differences in our data was in the increased frequency ofmisconfigurations around encryption, particularly around the use of SSL protocols.SSL in itself is outdated and insecure, and should be replaced with TLS 1\.2 or 1\.3\. This vulnerabilityis common with applications deployed to the cloud, because teams dont always go into theproviders settings and adjust security configurations.While this is another example of a low\-severity flaw, the use of outdated transport protocols doesntcome without its risks. Attackers with a Man\-in\-the\-Middle (MITM) position can break into older securecommunication channels and attempt to decrypt the information. Some configurations also allow anattacker to downgrade communication from a stronger cipher suite to one that they can crack.SSL vs TLSSSL stands for Secure Socket Layer, which is a type of protocol responsible for encryption,protecting the transfer of sensitive information like credit card details, Social SecurityNumbers, or other types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).Because SSL has serious cryptographic weaknesses, the next version of the protocolTLSor Transport Layer Securitybecame available in 1999\. There have been multiple securityupdates since then, but many servers still take connections using outdated versions of theprotocol. What we recommend is that your servers accept TLS v 1\.2 or higher.11THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?TOP 5 FINDINGSHow to fix and prevent Insecure SSL?1\.Use only the most up\-to\-date TLS protocols. Configure your servers to accept onlyTLS version 1\.2 or 1\.3\.2\.Do not accept any Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) versions.3\.Configure the server to use only strong cipher suites, which include AES ciphers at128 bits or higher, TDESTDEA triple\-length keys, and RSA at 2048 bits or higher.Note: For legacy clients that require insecure browsers (sorry, Internet Explorer), it maybe necessary to enable TLS 1\.0\. However, if you need to be PCI DSS compliant (e.g. yourcompany processes credit card information), this is strictly forbidden.While youre at it, now is also a good time to check your SSL certificates and make sure theyInsecure SSL or TLS protocolshave not expired.05\. Lack of Security HeadersSetting up security headers can be an effective and inexpensive way to strengthen the security of aweb application. At the same time, implementing them can seem tedious, especially to a stretcheddevelopment team.The impact of lacking security headers can vary depending on the context of the application. Amissing HTTP Strict Transport Security header on an online banking application is concerning,because an attacker could successfully intercept users HTTP requests and redirect them to a clonepage to steal their information.Teams should carefully consider which headers are most important to both their operations andusers, and work towards adding them across their servers.Why Bother with Security Headers?Security Headers are a type of HTTP response headercode which instructs browsers howto display content and interact with a web page without any of that instruction rendering onthe users screen.12THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?TOP 5 FINDINGSSecurity headers regulate security features around that communication and can help mitigatedifferent attacks, such as Clickjacking, XSS, and encryption\-related downgrade attacks.They can also strengthen privacy by enabling users to use their browsers security featuressuch as disabling access to their webcam or microphone.How to implement security headers:Consider implementing the following recommended security headers, at minimum: HTTP Strict Transport Security X\-Frame\-Options X\-Content\-Type\-Options Content\-Security\-Policy X\-Permitted\-Cross\-Domain\-Policies Cross\-Origin\-Resource\-PolicyFor more information on these and other headers that your servers may need, see theOWASP Secure Headers Project.NEXT CHAPTER: HOW MUCH RISK ARE TEAMS MANAGING?13THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|HOW MUCH RISK ARE TEAMS MANAGING?How Much Risk Are Teams Managing?In 2021, the majority of vulnerabilities we found were lower risk, with 54% classed as Low severityand 11% classed as Informational. 24% were Medium, 10% were High, and less than 1%0\.88%to be exactwere Critical.What These Risk Levels MeanEvery pentesting company describes their findings risk level differently. Until 2021, Cobaltused a 3\-level system based on Impact (how the flaw could affect technical and businessoperations) and Likelihood (how likely it is attackers will exploit the flaw).In 2021, we switched to 5 more granular and descriptive levels. These are still based onImpact and Likelihood, but capture more nuance to the highest and lowest ends of the riskscale. Heres what they mean:Informational: Notes vulnerabilities of minimal risk to your business.Low: Specifies common vulnerabilities with minimal impact on their own, butpossibly dangerous if chained.Medium: Vulnerabilities that are Medium risk \<\> Medium impact, Low risk \<\> Highimpact, or High risk \<\> Low impact.High: Impacts the security of your application platformhardware, including supportingsystems. Includes high probability vulnerabilities with a high business impact.Critical: Includes vulnerabilities such as administrative access, remote codeexecution, financial theft, and more.Compared to 2020, we reported fewer findings with a severity level of Medium, High, andCriticalwhat organizations might label importantwhile Low and Informational became morecommon in 2021\. Do these drops signal that assets are becoming more secure? Not necessarily.14THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|HOW MUCH RISK ARE TEAMS MANAGING?% of findings with Critical severity% of findings with High severity% of findings with Medium severityFigure 3: Percentage of total findings with Critical, High, or Medium severity levels in 2020 and 2021Low and Informational vulnerabilities often get ignored or postponed because they dont triggeralarm bells. These flaws pile up and attackers can chain them into more impactful attacks. Heresan example:Finding \#1: Username enumeration with a lack of rate limiting. Attackers can send hundredsor thousands of login requests without being stopped.Finding \#2: Weak password policy. Customers can set passwords like 12345\.On their own, these findings might not look critical, but together they give attackers the opportunityto brute\-force their way into the application. It takes only one user with a weak password. Onceattackers have access, they can look for other ways to increase their privileges and do more damage.As we help customers patch vulnerabilities, we can observe how teams react to these findings. Thescenarios we see are: Teams fix the finding and request a retest to confirm if the fix is working correctly. Note that 
we offer retests on discovered findings for free, so there is no financial barrier to retesting. Teams mark the finding as Accepted Risk because its severity level doesnt meet theirremediation threshold. Teams dont report their decision back to us. The finding could have been fixed, but a retest 
hasnt checked if their patch is working. Alternatively, its staying in their backlogs for anindefinite period of time.15THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|HOW MUCH RISK ARE TEAMS MANAGING?Figure 4: Percentage of findings marked Accepted Risk or lacking return information in 2021Even if we dont know the reason, the intent behind Accepted Risk findings is clear: there willnot be immediate action to remove this vulnerability. Findings with no return information are moreambivalent. We dont know the outcome on the customers side, but we do know that the patchhasnt been retestedchances are, there could still be an issue that gives attackers access. When welook at our data, we see a clear trend. The less critical a finding is, the less likely it is that teamswill fix and verify it. That might seem obvious, but the reasoning isnt what you think.Its wrong to assume the core of the problem is that teams dont care. We looked into this in lastyears report and we found a much more nuanced situation: security teams are determined toprioritize low\-risk flawsnearly 80% said they wished their organization focused on them justas much as High or Critical flaws. The challenge is a lack of resources, where 25% of ourrespondents said it took at least 60 days to patch low\-risk findings.NEXT CHAPTER: HOW MUCH TIME DOES IT TAKE TO FIX VULNERABILITIES?16THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|HOW MUCH TIME DOES IT TAKE TO FIX VULNERABILITIES?How Much Time Does It Take to 
Fix Vulnerabilities?The median number of days teams needed to fix vulnerabilities was 14\. But things started to changeas we dug into that number. Do findings with a certain risk level get fixed faster, or slower? Doescompany sizeand by extension security and development team sizeinfluence that number in anyway? Based on industry benchmarks around company and team sizes (these dont hold true foreveryone, but theyre a good place to start), we broke down our remediation data one step further.Figure 5: Median number of days to fix findings per severity level and company sizeSmallMid\-SizeCorporateEnterpriseCompanies with 1\-50Companies with 51\-500employeesemployeesCompanies with 501\-
1500 employeesCompanies with 1500\+employeesNo dedicated securityUp to 5 security team5\-10 security team10\+ security teamteammembersmembersmembersOur expectations were that the closer a findings risk level is to Critical, the faster it gets fixed.This is true in most cases, with the exception of Enterprise companies who need 21 days (median)for the task. A couple of factors could be causing this: they are the largest company type in ourlist and are therefore more likely to have more complicated environments and slower change\-management processes.17THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|HOW MUCH TIME DOES IT TAKE TO FIX VULNERABILITIES?What surprised us was that Enterprise companies on average took 7 days to fix Informationalfindingswe expected these to be left as the lowest priority, requiring 31 days or longer. It could bethat they are more straightforward to fix and get remediated first as low\-hanging fruit, while othersare stuck somewhere in the pipeline.This graph does confirm that smaller companies are faster in fixing their findings. The Smallcategory seems to be the fastest with every risk level, but Mid\-Size arent too far behind.Why is this? We admit that a research best practice is to translate data into actionable insight, butwe came up short when we tried to posit a conclusive answer. Our assumptions are that smallercompanies might be more nimble, with smaller attack surfaces and fewer processes to follow.They can maintain velocity because they are often born in the cloud, practice agile processes, andsmaller teams face greater scrutiny and individual accountability than their enterprise counterparts.Enterprises may follow a waterfall methodology, or be undergoing digital transformation to migratelegacy systems and processes.Regardless, we recognize that this is guesswork and aim to make it a point of further exploration inThe State of Pentesting 2023\.NEXT CHAPTER: TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENT18THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENTTalent Shortages Holding Back 
Security \& DevelopmentOur pentesting data helped us conclude that: Teams are struggling to fix and prevent the same vulnerabilities for at least the past 5 years in a row. The majority of findings stem from not staying on top of configurations, software updates,or access management controls. Teams want to fix every vulnerability, but end up neglecting those classed as low\-risk. The findings that do get fixed typically take 14 days, but this number can fluctuate 
considerably based on the risk level, with some findings needing 31 days or longer.Teams want to have robust security, but struggle to meet that objective. Cobalts State of Pentestingreports explore why; last year we looked into tools, processes, and where workflows could be moreefficient. But thats only part of the story.Before anything else, successful security programs need the right people, and enough of them.Everyone within an organization can be a part of this process, but as companies move towards aDevSecOps approach, the two main pillars are the security and development teams.Both have to balance a multitude of competing priorities: business objectives, go\-to\-marketstrategies and launch roadmaps, compliance and risk governance, maintaining infrastructure,monitoring for vulnerabilities, remediating as many flaws as possible, staying prepared for a growinglist of attack vectors, training employeeswe can keep going, but you get the point. As organizationsstruggle to remain competitive amidst an unpredictable global economy, heavy expectations fall onthe shoulders of these two teams.Do they have what they need to succeed? Our research has come back with a resounding No.Both security and development teams are struggling with alarming talent shortages. Its up to debatewhether The Great Resignation is causing this problem, or is exacerbating an issue going much furtherback in time. Its more important to focus on what teams are sharing right now: theyre stressed,struggling to keep operations running at required standards, and thinking of leaving. The rest of ourreport explores these issues and shares what employers and team leads could do to reverse them.19THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENTThe Impact on Security TeamsNearly every security team has been, is, or will be struggling withfinding and retaining talent. 45% of security respondents said theirdepartment is currently experiencing a shortage of employees,11% expect to have this challenge in the near future, and 38% saidthey had to deal with it in the last 6 months, but have been able toresolve it for now.of security respondents 
affected by labor shortagesThis talent shortage isnt happening solely because there are toomany jobs and too few candidates. Theres a more distressingtrend: people are quitting their jobs. 84% of respondents said thatsomeone from their team has left within the past six months.The Hard Hit to Security Programs90% of respondents who have suffered shortages or lost team members are struggling withworkload management. Heres the impact we see:struggle to maintain high 
quality security standardsstruggle to consistently 
monitor for vulnerabilitiesstruggle to monitor for and 
respond to security incidentsThe majority are feeling the hit in multiple areas. Security teams have historically been strugglingto keep up with business needs, and talent challenges are not making things easier. The securitystandards hardest hit are: Compliance to cybersecurity frameworks: 62% of respondents selected Supporting secure development: 50% Risk governance: 49% Maintaining critical security infrastructure: 46% Employee training: 34%20THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENTTHE IMPACT ON SECURITY TEAMSAs far as vulnerabilities are concerned, the categories teams worry about most are: Server security misconfigurations: 51% of respondents selected Insecure data storage: 45% Server\-side injections: 43% Sensitive data exposure: 42% Using components with known vulnerabilities: 36% Broken authentication and session management: 33% Cross\-site scripting: 25% Cross\-site request forgery: 23% Lack of binary hardening: 21% Broken access control: 17% Network security misconfigurations: 16%As for monitoring and responding to incidents, the threats that keep teams up at night are: Social engineering: 55% of respondents selected Third\-party software exposure: 45% Networkapplication compromise: 45% Phishing: 41% Information leakage: 41% Ransomware: 37% IoT attacks: 27% Damage to reputation: 19% DoS and DDoS: 16%Impact on Team MembersPlagued by limited resources and mounting pressure, people seetheir colleagues leave and their work increase. Burnout startsto enter the picture. 58% of respondents said they are currentlyexperiencing it, 63% said their mental health has been impacted,and 64% even said the job stress has affected their physical health.Its only a matter of time before they start thinking of leaving too. Infact, a startling 54% of our security respondents said they currentlywant to quit their jobs.of security respondents are 
considering quitting their jobs21THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENTThe Impact on Development TeamsWhile security teams are looking to developers for help in fixingand preventing vulnerabilities, development teams are dealing withtalent problems of their own. 45% of the developers we surveyed arecurrently dealing with a shortage of employees, 12% said they expectto have this issue in the next 6 months, and 36% said they had talentshortages in the past 6 months, but have resolved them for now.of development respondents 
affected by labor shortagesOnly 7% said they have been adequately staffed and expect tocontinue that way. This aligns with mass job resignation, as 81% ofrespondents confirmed someone from their development team hasleft the company within the last 6 months.Development Gets SidetrackedJust as with security teams, talent shortages have caused noticeable disruptions for dev teams. Themain impact to their work includes: Decreased standards: 70% of developers said their teams ability to adhere to code qualitystandards has suffered. Lowered response time: 74% said labor shortages cause noticeable disruption to their usualresponse time for fixing security vulnerabilities. Decreased security participation: 70% agreed that labor shortages interfere with their abilityto participate in security objectives such as tabletop exercises and threat profiling. Monitoring and logging disruption: 75% agreed that the labor shortages weaken their abilityto keep an eye on monitoring and logging tools. Administrative disruption: 71% agreed that labor shortages disrupt administration of DevOpstools and workload systems (Jira, GitHub, CircleCI, etc.).

with them, but additionally 73% agreed that labor shortages disrupt their personal learningand education goals.22THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENTTHE IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT TEAMSImpact on Team MembersEach talent loss has detrimental consequences for dev teams. Infact, 63% of respondents said that their mental andor physicalhealth has been negatively impacted by labor shortages. And likesecurity employees, the majority (66%) are feeling burnt out. Thetalent crisis also has negative implications for personal (86%) andteam (78%) morale, so its no surprise that development teamsmight also be facing continued losses, with 53% of our respondentssaying they currently want to quit their jobs.of development respondents are

RelationshipAs talent shortages hit teams individually, by extension they also make it harder to collaborate.More security respondents (89%) felt that DevSecOps workflows are strained compared to their devcounterparts (70%). The good news is both teams report that their colleagues show empathy and tryto fill in the gaps where possible.Its harder to collaborateThe other team tries to help89% agree70% agree91% agree84% agreeFigure 6: Talent shortages impact on collaboration between security and developmentWhat specific challenges do talent shortages cause? We asked both sides, and their responsespoint to the same thing: security concerns arent as top\-of\-mind as they should be.In fact, 69% of security respondents reported a lack of urgency in patching vulnerabilities and 63%reported issues repeating themselves in later code releases.23THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENTIMPACT ON THE SECURITY \<\> DEVELOPMENT RELATIONSHIPThis can easily turn into a frustrating situation for the security team, but developers seem pushedagainst all odds in managing multiple priorities, based on the list of challenges they shared: Deprioritization of security posturecollaboration due to other developmental commitments:62% of respondents selected Policies and procedures changing when personnel changes: 55% Lack of trust andor discomfort with level of accountability when working on security issues: 47% Loss of knowledge holders: 44% Difficulty keeping up with noisy monitoring and scanning tools: 34% Increase in the overall number of issues to reviewresolve: 30% Disagreements about required strength of security posture: 14%Notice that disagreements about the overall security posture is not a prevalent issue. This suggestsdevelopers want to be focused on remediation and prevention, but are unable to under the currentcircumstances. Their workload either has to decreasewhich is unlikely in todays highly competitivetechnology worldor they need more manpower, which is a thorny problem.Talent shortages and collaboration issues manifest into larger problems that should put organizationson high alert: security and operations are at risk.of security respondents

compromise the quality and 
security of their codeOne might assume that teams can manage as long as they realign their priorities: low\-risk issueswould have to be ignored for some time, opening up enough resources to fix the most criticalfindings and launch the most important features.24THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENTIMPACT ON THE SECURITY \<\> DEVELOPMENT RELATIONSHIPThe truth is teams have been doing this juggling act for years, and there isnt much more left to putin the backlog that wont significantly hurt operations. Here are the hard stats:96% of security respondents who reported collaboration issues said they are now slowed down inpatching critical vulnerabilities. This creates considerable risk of a successful breach.The majority (97%) of developers feeling the strain reported its harder to meet critical deadlinesfor feature launches, and 80% said collaboration challenges compromise the quality and security oftheir code.A vicious circle forms: remediation is delayed, new code comes out with more flaws that add to theproblem, and overstretched teams have more to deal with. The end result for the individual can befrustration and disillusionment, while for the organization it can be a breach that sets them backeven further.Hiring, Onboarding, and RetentionKeeping the Talent You HaveWith these rates of burnout, team disconnect, and work overload, how can organizations bestrespond? Fighting to retain talent is the first step that comes to mind. But we see a dissonancebetween efforts and results.95% of our respondents said that their organization prioritizes retaining and nurturing them. But ifemployers are trying this hard, why are so many planning their exit? Are organizations missing themark when it comes to what their teams truly value?One of our theories is that employers are being reactive, instead of proactive. A common scenario is tohave a knee\-jerk response when a team member puts in their resignation, offering a pay raise or additionalbenefits. But this could be too little, too late: the employee has made up their mind, not because of thisone conversation, but because of what has happened throughout their time with the team.So what can organizations start doing today? We asked our respondents, and heres what theyshared was important to them: 59% said they need a strong focus on their personal and professional development. 55% said they want a stronger community feeling while their company is primarily workingfrom home.25THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENTHIRING, ONBOARDING, AND RETENTION 44% said they wanted additional compensation options, such as bonuses or stock options. 41% said they wanted attention paid to their physical andmental wellbeing. 39% said they wanted more competitive pay that doesntfall behind the market. 39% said they want clearly structured and manageableworkloads. 31% said they want strong and supportive leadership.said they wanted more 
competitive pay 16% said they want varied career opportunities such as a flexible career ladder or options toswitch teams.These results gave us some food for thought. Competitive pay wasnt at the top of the list, like many(including us) might have expected.Instead, the focal point seems to be around needing fulfillment and community. Respondents wantto continue growing in their careers, rather than treat their roles as just a job. They want to feelconnected to their colleagues, especially when people arent together as often or at all while workingfrom home. Making these improvements isnt quite as straightforward as throwing money at theproblem: they take time and careful consideration, but can pay off considerably in the long term.Filling Open RolesWhile managing their retention, companies still have a major task ahead of themfilling their vacantroles. Of the respondents who have visibility into hiring efforts, 47% on the security side said itsslow and challenging to fill open positions. Interestingly, that number was lower for developmentrespondents: only 32% of them said theyre having difficulties finding the right people.Looking at Figure 7, for both sides the main problem seems to be finding the people with the rightskills: both hardhaving adequate technical knowledge, or experience with relevant toolsand soft,such as project management skills, handling feedback, and the ability to collaborate. At first glancethis might not be surprising. But when we combine it with the finding that people want more supportwith their professional development, we start to wonder if the current recruitment philosophy is flawed.26THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENTHIRING, ONBOARDING, AND RETENTIONFigure 7: The recruitment challenges security and development teams are experiencingRather than find the candidate who covers 95%\+ of the bullet points in the job description, it mightbe more sustainable to consider candidates who are missing a few core skills, but are eager to learnand can be coached.Companies could also do well to review their recruitment processes and cut out unnecessary steps.Inefficiencies can hurt both sides: the hiring team is stretched further, while the candidate startsgetting frustrated with the bureaucracy. This seems to be a pain point for security roles in particular.Our results show they are more likely to have to wrangle too many open roles at once compared tothe dev team.As far as which roles are the hardest to fill, the same level tripped up both teams: managers and teamleads. Security teams are struggling to find the right Directors or CISOs, while developers have thetoughest time finding DistinguishedPrincipalStaff Engineers, Engineering Managers and Tech Leads.Both teams need a long time to fill most of their positions. 70% of respondents said that, on average, ittakes at least 3 months. And the challenges dont end once an employee is hired66% of respondentssaid it typically takes at least 3 months to fully integrate a new team member into their department.Delegating and OutsourcingWhile teams are trying to fill roles, theyre looking to alternative solutions like outsourcing to a thirdparty. 82% of security respondents said they follow this strategy, and the dev team wasnt too farbehind with 80%.27THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|TALENT SHORTAGES HOLDING BACK SECURITY \& DEVELOPMENTHIRING, ONBOARDING, AND RETENTIONHeres what they typically outsource:SecurityDevelopment Detection and response: 71% Software development: 83% Pentesting: 69% IoT security: 41% Red teaming: 33% Threat intelligence: 30% Security compliancetesting: 43% InfrastructureDevOps: 40% Product managementDesign: 37% Testing (QATA): 29% Data engineering: 23% Visual Design (UIUX): 13%Pentesting was the second\-most outsourced security service in our survey. In part this is becausecompliance frameworks require a third party to execute it. But theres unquestionable value inhaving a professional team find vulnerabilities before an attacker does. Those who outsourcepentesting are generally satisfied, rating their experience as 4 out of 5 on average.However, there is still room for improvement. The number one change respondents are after? Speed.74% said their pentesting provider could optimize their experience by getting tests scoped andrunning in less time. But speed alone isnt enoughthey also need the process to be easier, morecollaborative, and more transparent. After all, a vendor shouldnt be adding more complexity to analready stretched team. They should be making things easier.Figure 8: What changes respondents want to see with pentesting servicesTraditional vendors like consultancies struggle to match those requirements. Pentest as a Servicevendors are more aligned with flexibility and speed. We explore how these two options stack upagainst each other in The Buyers Guide to Modern Pentesting.28THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|CONCLUSION: ENABLING TEAMS TO SUCCEEDConclusion: Enabling Teams to SucceedEvery team wants to do great work. Yes, our data points to talent shortages, collaboration hiccups,mounting attack scenarios, and growing numbers of vulnerabilities that get pushed to backlogs. Butwe also observe that despite these odds, teams keep running. They keep trying.A truly humbling moment in our research was when we asked our respondents Do your securitydevelopment counterparts help you fill in the gaps? We got a resounding Yes from both sides.Despite everything about their work radically shifting in the past 2 years, people show empathy forone another and try to keep each other up. They might not be getting it all done, but they have theireyes on the prize: enable and defend the organization. It goes without saying that the organizationshould do the same for them.The challenges we outline in this report are difficult, but theyre not impossible to solve. Wevebroken down our proposed solutions into two groups:Group 1: Vulnerability Management \& Remediation\#1\. Focus on learning.Share regular training with teams based on security reports like the OWASP Top 10 listand Cobalts State of Pentesting reports2\. Do some spring cleaning.Review your security configurations, accessuser matrixes, SSL certificates, softwareversions, and security headers. Having these set up and consistently monitored canaddress a big portion of the top vulnerabilities we see each year3\. Clearly communicate risk.Show leadership how inadequate resources and mounting low\-risk findings can link up andturn into much bigger security problems. Our 2021 report can help you with some stats4: Outsource to agile vendors.Find vendors who help you, rather than burden you. Be ruthless with questions aroundhow much time they need to deliver results, how they integrate with your systems, andwhat efficiencies they can bring to your workflows. Check out this buyers guide forsome sourcing tips.29THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|CONCLUSION: ENABLING TEAMS TO SUCCEEDCONCLUSION: ENABLING TEAMS TO SUCCEEDGroup 2: Employee Wellbeing and Sustainable Recruitment\#1: Put employee development first.The majority of our respondents want more support in growing personally andprofessionally. In addition, a large portion of teams are struggling to find new candidateswith the right hard skills. It could be a better strategy to hire less experienced talent andinvest more in their training and certifications2: Keep recruitment simple.Inefficient recruitment processes were the biggest hiring complaint after candidateslacking hard and soft skills. Review your hiring steps and consider where you canstreamline without sabotaging your vetting process: it could be fewer interviews, orcandidates talking to multiple members of the hiring committee in one call, or cuttingback on the number of assignments3: Streamline your onboarding.On average it takes 3 months to fully onboard a new hire. This can put a lot of strain onyour established team, especially if they have to put training time aside for every new hire.Consider pre\-recording training sessions that are universal to roles and including them inyour onboarding decks.We said it at the start: Security is the result of decisions and actions made by many different people.With this report, we hope readers feel empowered to take the actions that will have the strongestimpact, empowering and supporting their teams throughout the rest of 2022\.30THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022\|COBALTS TAKE ON PENTESTINGCobalts Take on PentestingStart Testing
