In 2021, its infrastructure was taken down through the collaborative effortof various law enforcement agencies from different countries.7However, the dismantling of its infrastructure did not signal the end of Emotet. Just a few months later, itwas observed being used in a Trickbot campaign.8 In the first half of 2022, we saw a massive uptick inEmotet detections compared to those in the first half of 2021, proof that the botnet is thriving as a resultof threat actors opting to integrate it into their operations.

Asevidenced by a March 2022 campaign that we analyzed, however, these cyberattacks are not a one\-waystreet. In this campaign, operators used a piece of malware called RuRansom designed to infect Russiantargets. Although its name implies otherwise, RuRansom is not an example of ransomware but a wiperdesigned to destroy its victims data and backup files. Our discovery of numerous versions of RuRansomindicates that the malware is still under development.10 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportAlthough several ransomware groups became involved, it would be a mistake to think that ransomwaregangsweretheonlyonestotakepartintheRussia\-Ukrainewar.Forexample,hacktivistcollectiveAnonymous took part in the cyber conflict by targeting Russian assets and information in attacks thatincluded publishing confidential files from the Russian central bank, taking over state\-controlled television,and leaking the personal data of Russian military personnel.16Other malicious actors, while not directly targeting either side of the conflict, still attempted to capitalizeon the situation. Through our honeypot, we found war\-related spam emails aiming to take advantage ofthe situation under the guise of asking for donations and using scams to create bogus recipients of suchdonations.

Phishing emails remain a common infiltration technique, with attackers using GoogleDrive links to drop BazarLoader and the attack eventually leading to an infection. Conti can also arrive ona targets machine by exploiting vulnerabilities like the FortiGate firewall vulnerabilities CVE\-2018\-1337924and CVE\-2018\-13374,25 as well as various ProxyShell Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.2614 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportOnceinsidethesystem,toolslikeWhoami,Nltest,andNetareusedtoprovidetheattackerssomesystem information, such as the rights and permissions they have gained via the compromised machine.At the same time, the threat actors actively search for files that they can exfiltrate for use in their doubleextortion technique.

The infection chain used in a typical Conti attackAlthough relatively new to the ransomware scene compared to LockBit and Conti, BlackCat still managedto make waves in the months that it was active by going beyond the typical double extortion scheme usedby modern ransomware groups. Instead, BlackCat resorted to a triple extortion scheme29 where it notonly threatened to encrypt files and leak sensitive data but also warned its victims that it would launchdistributed denial\-of\-service (DDoS) attacks on their infrastructure if the groups demands are not met.3015 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportBlackCats operators typically exploit exposed and vulnerable applications to gain entry into their targetsystem. They then use third\-party frameworks and toolsets such as Cobalt Strike to deliver the ransomware.In April 2022, we launched an investigation into BlackCat via the Trend Micro Vision One platform, wherewe gathered information about its routine. We found that the malicious actors were actively exploiting theMicrosoft Exchange Server vulnerability CVE\-2021\-3120731 to insert a web shell into the victims server forremote access. This allows the attackers the ability to remotely perform different tasks like stealing dataand dropping malicious tools. The attackers then use these tools to move laterally within the system, scanthe environment, and prepare it for eventual BlackCat infection.Due to BlackCats sophistication as the first professional ransomware family to be written in Rust, a secureprogramming language that has concurrent processing capabilities, as well as its unique monetizationmethod, extensive infrastructure, and wide array of supplementary tools in its attacks, it has the potentialto become a staple in the RaaS scene in the foreseeable future.Based on both our data and data from leak sites, we were able to note that these ransomware familiesare used mainly to target small businesses with up to 200 employees at most as well as medium\-sizedbusinesses with up to 1,000 employees. The likely reason for this is that these types of organizations haveless resources and a smaller workforce to properly deal with cyberattacks.32Linux Systems Become a Prime Target

Still, there is nothing newabout cybercriminals targeting ESXi. RansomEXX34, for example, has been exploiting ESXi vulnerabilitiesin its campaigns since at least 202135 and it seems that other threat actors are now following suit.InOctober2021,LockBitsoperatorsannouncedaLinux\-basedvariant,LockBitLinux\-ESXiLockerversion 1\.0, in an underground forum. This variant targets ESXi servers through a combination of AdvancedEncryption Standard (AES) and elliptic\-curve cryptography (ECC) algorithms to encrypt data. Since then,samples of this variant have been found in the wild.In May 2022, a new ransomware variant named Cheerscrypt was also found targeting devices using ESXi.36Based on the source code of the Babuk ransomware that was leaked in September 2021,37 Cheerscryptencrypts log files and other VMware\-related files using the double extortion technique.Although neither LockBit Linux\-ESXi Locker version 1\.0 nor Cheerscrypt deviates from the typical doubleextortion scheme used by many other ransomware variants, the potential impact of an infection is notableinthiscasesinceESXiserversarewidelyusedbyenterprisesforservervirtualization.Organizationscan also use these servers to host multiple virtual machines (VMs) where they keep important data. Thismeans that they are often part of an organizations critical infrastructure, and therefore any successfulattack on these components can deal great damage to an organization.17 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportBig Game\-Hunting Ransomware

The user also mentioned that they were offering a share of the profits to anypotential partners.Currently, information on the scope and structure of the malicious actors operation is limited. Given BlackBastas initial advertisement, however, it is likely that the group uses stolen credentials to gain access toits victims systems. It then proceeds to perform its encryption routine, first by deleting shadow copies viavssadmin.exe and then booting the device in safe mode. It then deletes the service called Fax, creates anew one using the malwares path, and adds it to the registry for persistence.

As a result, malicious actors see DDS as anattractive target. Since it serves as a security\-critical building block of the system, the exploitation of asingle vulnerability has the potential to leave an impact on the rest of the software stack.In January 2022, Trend Micro Research, TXOne Networks, and ZDI in collaboration with ADLINK Labs andAlias Robotics published an entry discussing DDS from a cybersecurity perspective. The entry includedinformation on 13 new vulnerabilities for the six most common DDS implementations.63 These new bugsalso affect Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2\), the default operating system for robotics and automationthat uses DDS as middleware, meaning that the impact of each vulnerability could affect more than justDDS itself.25 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportATT\&CK ICSSurfaceVectorCVEScopeCVSSWeaknesses (CWE)T0804: Brute Force IO

It exploitsa flaw in the Linux kernels memory management, specifically through how pipe page caches are mergedand overwrite other page caches.70 Dirty Pipe, which can potentially allow the elevation of an attackerto root privileges on the host, is relatively easy to exploit. It is therefore vital for organizations to checkwhether they are using vulnerable versions of the Linux kernel.

 TechnologiesIf there is anything we can glean from the current state of cybersecurity, its that the growth of the digitalattack surface has organizations scrambling to fill as many security gaps as they can. After two years ofremote work, some employees have started to shift back in some capacity to their on\-site workplaces,while others have adopted a hybrid arrangement. These varying configurations in working environments,together with the growing number of technologies that are being integrated into business operations, area call for organizations to allocate additional resources to cover as much of the attack surface as possible.Over time, threat actors have become more dangerous, launching attacks that have grown in both scaleand sophistication. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that threat actors now exploit multiple sections ofthe attack surface in a single campaign: After all, the rising popularity of service\-based malware has madeit easier for cybercriminals to launch attacks and for malware developers to hide their tracks.The evolution of ransomware from the more innocuous attacks of yesteryear to the double and eventriple extortion schemes of today means that defending systems against modern ransomware familiescannotbeviewedasanythinglessthantoppriority.Inthesamevein,widespreadtechnologiessuchas cloud services, where organizations do not physically control the infrastructure, must still rely on theshared responsibility model for effective security.92The first step in attack surface management (ASM) is the discovery of the attack surface itself, whereorganizations examine their assets and determine elements such as the critical importance of an asset,any potential vulnerabilities, the level of threat activity, and how much threat intelligence is being gatheredfromtheirassets.Assessingavailablesecuritycontrolsandhowtheyoffsetrisksisalsoanimportantpreliminary step in planning an organizations ASM.35 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportOne integral component of ASM is visibility, as it provides valuable information on potential threats. Inturn, this can help enterprises determine their risk exposure and allow them to take the necessary stepsto mitigate these risks.93Proper security protocols and best practices go a long way toward helping businesses protect their systemfrom attacks. Organizations should prioritize updating their software as soon as possible to minimize thechance of attackers successfully exploiting vulnerabilities in their system. Other options, such as virtualpatching, can help organizations protect their machines while they wait for vendors to provide securityupdates. Cloud users, meanwhile, should ensure that their cloud infrastructure is set up properly withappropriate security protocols in place to prevent attackers from capitalizing on misconfigurations. Usereducation is also a key part of a successful security posture since end users often serve as the weakestlinks that malicious actors try to exploit to gain access to other parts of an organizations system.However, the complex reality of securing infrastructure, systems, and endpoints means that even withthese in place, securing each possible point of attack would still be challenging without the right securitytools in place.While there are technologies that can individually handle security for different parts of a system, thesealso come with their own drawbacks, such as the inability to correlate different data points from eachsiloed source. Security teams are thus limited to working with only pieces of the puzzle at a time whentrying to determine how an attack happened and where it came from.A single platform that can cover the entire attack surface is the ideal solution for organizations, especiallythosewithlimitedresources.Withacomprehensiveplatform,organizationsstandtogaincompletevisibility over their attack surface, not to mention the ability to correlate different indicators so that theycan focus on the bigger picture. A unified security platform can also provide multilayered protection whilehelping reduce expenditures that would otherwise be spent on multiple security technologies.94 Lastly, tominimize potential security gaps, this platform must be configurable and capable of providing continuousprotection of digital assets to minimize potential security gaps.36 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity ReportThe Threat Landscape in BriefIn the first half of 2022, the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network protected users from more than 63billion threats consisting of email threats, mobile app threats, IoT threats, network threats, malicious files,and malicious URLs.63,789,373,773 2,911,929,067,913Blocked threatsOverall queriesBlocked email threatsBlocked malicious URLsBlocked malicious files33,316,115,0881,299,974,1626,340,820,72338,493,160,6921,398,395,52422,418,695,205010B20B30B40B0300M600M900M1\.2B1\.5B05B10B15B20B25BBlocked mobile app threatsBlocked IoT threats18,395,05717,494,6422,197,2182,448,759Blocked Smart Home
