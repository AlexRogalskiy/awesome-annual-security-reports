Executive Summary 
The 2022 Security Culture Report (SCR) is the largest, globally recognized research into security 
awareness, behavior and culture available. The SCR offers unique insights which allow organizational 
leaders to better understand how employees view security within their organizations. This information 
is also leveraged by business leaders to ensure necessary investment dollars are allocated to the 
most critical part of the security infrastructure: the human element.
The SCR provides a number of key resources essential in understanding and measuring an 
organizations security culture.
A Standard Way to Measure and Report
This report uses the globally recognized Security Culture Index. The use of a standard index offers 
direct value by allowing the reader to compare the information presented in a meaningful way. 
The index ranges are as follows: 
 
90 up to 100 Excellent
 
80 up to 89 Good
 
70 up to 79 Moderate
 
60 up to 69 Mediocre
 
0 up to 59 Poor
Ensure necessary investment 
dollars are allocated to 
the most critical part of the 
security infrastructure: 
the human element.
4
To identify where on the index an organization belongs, the Security Culture Survey (SCS) is used. 
Leveraged by 2,910 companies worldwide, the SCS is the most comprehensive measurement 
instrument available to assess an organizations security culture. 
The Global Pandemic Improved Security Culture
The impact of the global pandemic showed that while some industry sectors have reduced their 
security culture significantly, others have improved. The most significant finding is that no industry is 
found to have Poor or Mediocre security culture scores. Although all industry sectors have a security 
culture that is considered Moderate, many of the industries include organizations that have been 
rated as Good.
Security Culture Varies Around the World
Our results show that some regions and countries 
are reporting a much better security culture than 
others. A notable example is the United States 
of America, which generally trends higher on all 
aspects of security culture compared to other 
countries. Behind the USA is Europe, which has a 
much larger variation in security culture between 
countries, which results in a lower average. 
Africa, Asia and South America generally show 
a lower security culture, suggesting that more 
work is needed.
The impact of the global 
pandemic showed that 
while some industry sectors 
have reduced their security 
culture significantly, others 
have improved.

Industry Benchmarking With Trends
In 2022, we have introduced new graphics to the industry benchmark to make it easier to review 
and process. The new trend graph places the current score into context. We also provide a 
breakdown based on organizational size, 
allowing you to more accurately assess where 
your organization sits. Additionally, each 
industry benchmark is presented on a single 
page, making it easy to print and share only 
the information you need. 
Board Level Concern
Security culture has garnered attention from 
board\-level executives. The SCR provides all 
levels of executives, management and practitioners with the necessary context and data to help 
navigate the complexity of security within their own organization. In the ever\-increasing landscape 
of social engineering, and the challenge that the human factors bring to any organization today, 
it is critical that top\-level management understand the risk and the impact that security awareness, 
behaviors and culture has.
Defining Security Culture
It is important to note that the phrase security culture is beginning to find its way into the lexicon 
of security leaders. CISOs and security executives now commonly cite security culture as being 
a critical element of their security posture. But there is a problemsecurity leaders have vastly 
different definitions of security culture, meaning that they do not really know what they are all in 
agreement about. 
We define security culture as the ideas, customs and social behaviors that influence an organizations 
security. A common definition makes it possible to discuss the same thing, in the same way. We all 
know that if you do not measure something, that something does not exist.
Security culture: The ideas, 
customs and social behaviors of 
an organization that influence 
their security.

Introduction
The SCR is produced annually by KnowBe4 Research, allowing us to analyze the security culture 
of thousands of organizations globally. It is the largest report ever published on this topic, with an 
increasing data set year\-over\-year. The report offers the reader insight into the state of security 
measures and their impact, through the human factors lens. As such, this unique report offers 
important information to the global security industry and should be used by top management within 
an organization to inform their security program improvements for 2022\.
The first SCR was published in 2017, by the Norwegian research company CLTRe. After being 
acquired by KnowBe4 in 2019, the research unit became KnowBe4 Research, and is considered 
the leading security culture research organization in the world.
In the 2022 report, we introduce several new sections. For the first time, we can present security 
culture trends, exploring how industries change over time. We also presented data that helped 
explain the impact of the pandemic, and that should be used to understand how your industry sector 
performs. Additionally, we have added a regional breakdown, where we offer two different views 
into security culture around the world: 1\) general security culture; 2\) the impact that organizational 
size has on security culture globally. 
The Security Culture Industry Benchmark offers a deep dive into each industry sector. We have made 
several changes to this section in this report, introducing trends and organizational size perspectives. 
The 2022 SCR is divided into the following sections:

Changes in the Security Culture Report 2022
The following new sections have been added to the 2022 report:
 
A Global Perspective on Security CultureRegional data breakdown of Europe, USA, 
Canada and Latin America with regional map visualizations. This section also includes security 
culture as measured by organizational size security culture and dimension scores by size of 
organizations: small, medium and large.
 
TrendsHow different industries have performed regarding security culture over the past two 
to three years. 
These new sections have one thing in commonthe data is represented visually via graphs and 
maps. We believe visualizing the data makes the information easier to digest. However, if you prefer 
to see the actual numbers in table format, you can find this in the Methodology section.
To make space for all this new content, the Detailed Analysis of Security Culture section was removed. 
Our plans are to publish this type of analysis in a different report in the future. Additionally, the 
Comparing Dimensions Scores Across Industries section has been discontinued with the data now 
available on each industry page. 
Another change this year is the Industry Benchmark section. This year, the boxplots have been 
removed to allow space for trend data on all dimensions and an analysis of scores by organizational 
size. We are excited about this change, as it allows for a more detailed and longterm perspective 
on security culture. For those still interested in the statistics associated with the boxplot, you can find 
these in the Methodology section.
Lastly, there have been some changes to the industries included in this years report.
 
Internet and Software Services, which was previously in the Other category, is now in Technology.
 
Hospitality, also in the Other category, is now an independent benchmark.
 
SCS data where the industry is unknown has been removed and therefore has eliminated the 
Other category.
Our continuous content review and subsequent changes allow us to keep providing you with the 
most relevant and useful data available.

Security CultureA HighLevel 
Perspective
In this section, we offer a brief overview of what security culture is. 
What Is Security Culture
We define security culture as: The ideas, customs and social behaviors that influence 
an organizations security. 
This definition makes it clear that security culture is a combination of thought 
processes and knowledge, the habits that employees have adapted and the 
behaviors that are demonstrated when in the workplace. By workplace, 
we mean any such place where employees perform their work. We 
define security broadly. 
With this definition in mind, organizations should focus their 
efforts on a combination of employee engagement with 
assessments and training, improve process and procedures 
and by implementing technology that makes it easy 
for the employee to do the right thing. 
For more in\-depth information on what 
security culture is, and how to successfully 
implement a security culture program at 
your organization, refer to The Security 
Culture Playbook, An Executive Guide 
To Reducing Risk and Developing 
Your Human Defense Layer by 
Perry Carpenter and Kai 
Roer (Wiley, 2022\). 
9
Security Culture Dimensions
We systematically evaluate culture across seven 
distinct dimensions:
 
Attitudes: The feelings and beliefs that 
employees have toward the security 
protocols and issues.
 
Behaviors: The actions and activities 
of employees that have direct or indirect 
impact on the security of the organization.
 
Cognition: Employees understanding, 
knowledge and awareness of security 
issues and activities.
 
Communication: The quality of 
communication channels to discuss security\-
related topics, promote a sense of belonging 
and provide support for security issues and 
incident reporting.
 
Compliance: The knowledge of written 
security policies and the extent that 
employees follow them.
 
Norms: The knowledge of and adherence to 
unwritten rules of conduct in the organization.
 
Responsibilities: How employees perceive 
their role as a critical factor in sustaining or 
endangering the security of the organization.
Security Culture Index
The Security Culture Index (SCI) is the global 
index for rating organizations based on their 
security culture score. The index was created by 
the team of researchers at KnowBe4 Research 
and is calculated by analyzing the security 
culture of thousands of organizations around 
the world. More details on the index itself, and 
the direct risk attached to each level, can be 
found in the research paper Security Culture and 
Credential Sharing, available for download at: 
 https:
get.clt.recredential\-sharing\-research
 
90 up to 100 Excellent
 
80 up to 89 Good
 
70 up to 79 Moderate
 
60 up to 69 Mediocre
 
0 up to 59 Poor
Note: None of the industry sectors have 
demonstrated Excellent or Good security 
culture this year.

The Security Culture Maturity Model
The data\-driven and evidence\-based Security Culture Maturity Model, developed by KnowBe4 
Research, is the industrys first maturity model specifically geared to measure security culture. The 
model is fueled by KnowBe4s massive security awareness, behavior and culture dataset.

The Five Maturity Levels
The models range accounts for organizations with no formal or intentional awareness, behavior or 
culture plan other than to achieve basic compliance (Level 1\) all the way up to the most sophisticated 
organizations that seek to push beyond the pack and are actively working to shape even the 
unwritten rules and social dynamics of how their employees value security. Learn more about these

A Global 
Perspective on 
Security Culture
Measuring security culture is a global concern. 
Understanding the security culture of your 
workplace is proving increasingly important 
for the security posture of the organization. 
As we demonstrated in the 2021 SCR, 910 
global security leaders believe that security 
culture is a critical factor to their successful 
implementation of a security program. The 
gap between the acceptance of security 
culture being critical and the implementation 
of a security culture program, is demonstrated 
by the lack of data from many countries. 
Of particular interest, outside Europe and 
North America, we have noted a dramatic 
drop in organizations measuring security 
culture, leaving them blindsided when it comes 
to assessing the human factors of security. 
Below, we share regional breakdowns for your 
reference, but the important message is that 
organizations must step up their game and 
invest in security awareness, behavior and 
culture in the years to come. This is not a nice 
to have, it is a critical asset used to reduce risk 
and improve security. 
Security culture is found in every organization, 
all around the world. In this section, we are 
comparing security culture and commenting 
on the observations and measurements. When 
looking at security culture from a satellite 
perspective, the variation between regions is 
small, with only two points between the worst 
performing and the best performing.

Security Culture
Figure 2: The global perspective of security culture.
North America scored 74 (the best), with the rest of the world comparable to Europe and Asia 
scoring 73, and Latin America, Africa and Oceania scoring 72\. 
This global overview easily gives a false understandingthat all regions perform similarly and that 
things are not too bad. But the reality is more nuanced, and shocking, than what the aggregated 
picture may indicate. That becomes clear as we dig into each of the regions. 
In the breakdown below, we use the same scale across all regions and countries, to make it easy 
to visually compare regions and countries. 
Sample sizes are not large enough to further break down the regions of Central and South America, 
Africa and Asia. These regions are lagging behind in security investments in general, and especially 
in security awareness, behavior and culture. In 2022, it is common knowledge that human factors 
have a dramatic impact on security, regardless of the geographical location of an organization. It 
is therefore our strong recommendation that organizations and nations around the world invest in 
programs and strategies to dramatically improve the assessment and training of employees.
Security Culture According To Organizational Size Worldwide 
In this section, we examine security culture based on organizational size:
 
Large1,000\+ employees and are represented with the red line.
 
Medium250 to 1,000 employees and are shown with the green line.
 
Smallless than 250 employees and are represented with the blue line.

Global Overview
Figure 3: Security culture as seen by organizational size (Global overview).
We see an interesting pattern emerge when examining the security culture 
scores globally. At first glance, it seems like security culture is similar regardless 
of the size of the organization. In addition, the two valleys in the graph are 
appearing in the same place: in the Cognition and the Responsibility dimensions. 
Upon closer inspection, we see that large organizations report better attitudes and 
behaviors than smaller organizations. This may be related to the fact that many 
larger organizations are likely to be publicly traded, and thus regulated. 
On the other hand, small organizations scored better on all other 
dimensions, something that is really visible on the Communication 
dimension, where the Large organizations scored five points 
less. Communication tends to be easier in smaller groups, 
and this is clearly demonstrated here.

In Africa, we see that Large organizations generally do better than others when it comes to security 
culture. There are two notable differences: the Cognition and Communication dimensions, where 
Small organizations perform much better than the others. Africa has a sample size of 52 organizations 
and 14,121 employees.
Security Culture in Africa
In Africa, there is a tradition and interest in security culture, especially in South Africa (73\), where 
we expected a higher level of security culture than was achieved. In the other countries in Africa 
where we have data, we see very wide variations in security culture, which is likely explained by 
limited sample sizes. We expect to see more African countries measuring security culture in the 
future. In the meantime, we urge 
organizations and governments 
to focus on the human aspects of 
security and invest in education 
and training.

In Asia, we see that organizational size is a smaller factor than in some other regions. With the 
exception of Medium organizations on the Attitudes and Behaviors dimensions, we see that the 
organizational size has little impact on security culture. Our findings may be skewed due to the 
comparably small sample size of 39 organizations and 15,095 employees across the continent.
Security Culture in Asia
In Asia, we see a wide variation of security culture scores across nations. While Japan (76\) is doing 
reasonably well, countries like Malaysia (66\) and Indonesia (67\) show an alarmingly low security 
culture index score. Our general recommendation for organizations in Asia is to invest in security 
awareness, behavior and culture programs.

Europe shows a relatively consistent variation across the size of organizations. The most notable difference 
is seen in the dimensions Communication and Compliance. Small organizations are dramatically better 
at communicating than other organizations. Large organizations score the highest when it comes to 
compliance. Europe has a sample size of 141 organizations and 30,016 employees.
Security Culture in Europe
In Europe (73\), we observe large 
variations in security culture between 
countries. The worst performing 
countries are Portugal (64\), Latvia 
(66\) and France (67\). These results 
may be due to small sample sizes 
in these countries, suggesting that 
security measures in general are 
lacking. We urge these countries to 
implement measures to improve their 
security and reduce risk. 
On the more favorable end of the 
spectrum, we find Sweden (77\) 
and Ireland (78\), both often being 
considered technologically advanced. 
Along with them, we also find that 
Italy (77\) and Bulgaria (79\) score higher. Even so, no countries in Europe report a Good score on 
the Security Culture Index. Considering the ongoing geopolitical situation, our recommendations 
are that countries in Europe take action to improve their security culture by assessing their employees 
and implementing training and education programs to ensure the right security behaviors.

better and Small organizations underperform. It is also worth noting that the North American and 
European security cultures follow a very similar pattern. The sample size for all of North America 
is 1,144 organizations and 184,701 employees.

The North American region in this report consists of the USA and Canada. As a region, North 
America is more favorable than the rest of the world, with an average score of 74\. When looking at

In Canada, we see the overall security culture score of all three sizes of organizations (73\) is consistent. 
Canada also shows very little variation in the dimension scores across the size of organizations. Overall, 
the best performing dimensions are Attitudes and Communication, in which Small organizations 
outperform the others. Looking closer, Small and Medium sized organizations appear to perform the 
same or better than Large organizations on every dimension except Compliance and Responsibility. 
However, performance of these two dimensions is relatively low for all organizations in Canada. 
Canada has a sample size of 76 organizations and 7
,108 employees. 
Security Culture in Canada
Canada had a large variation 
between the state scores, ranging 
from the best performing Quebec 
(76\) and Saskatchewan (76\) to the 
worst performing Yukon (64\). A score 
of 64 is ranked as Mediocre on the 
Security Culture Index and signifies 
a large increase in human factor 
risks compared to the level above, 
Moderate. 
Sample sizes in many Canadian 
states are low, suggesting that most 
organizations do not have even a 
minimum level of security measures 
in place. It is our recommendation 
that organizations in these regions implement adequate security culture measures, including training 
and assessments.

In the USA, we see differences in security culture based on organizational size, where small

communicating than larger organizations, and have higher levels of Cognition and Responsibility. 
Large organizations rate the highest when it comes to Behavior. For organizations of all sizes, there 
are two notable valleys in Cognition and Responsibility. It is our recommendation that organizations 
assess their employees to identify weak spots in employees understanding around their role and 
responsibilities towards security, and implement targeted training and education programs to improve. 
The USA has a sample size of 1,068 organizations and 177,593 employees. 
Security Culture in the United States of America
The USA is underperforming when it comes to security culture. When breaking the country into the 
states, a more detailed image emerges: the national score is hiding differences in the scores between the 
states. We observe that both 
East and West coast states 
are generally performing 
with better scores, with 
Vermont (77\) and Rhode

In the region of Oceania, we noticed that, unlike other regions, none of the lines cross or even meet. We

while Small organizations outperform the others on all dimensions. Also worth noting is that Large 
organizations in Oceania perform very poorly on Compliance and Responsibility compared to Europe 
and North America, suggesting that these two dimensions should be given more attention going 
forward. The sample size for all of Oceania is 46 organizations and 9,635 employees. 
Security Culture in Oceania
Security culture in Oceania is showing 
that Australia (73\) and New Zealand 
(72\) are quite different from each 
other, and neither is doing particularly 
well. It is highly recommended that 
organizations in this region step 
up their investments in security 
awareness, behavior and culture 
going forward. The other parts of 
the region are lagging far behind, 
not even measuring on the Security 
Culture Index.

Figure 19: Security culture in Central and South America as seen by organizational size.
Our sample size for Central and South America is 24 organizations and 2,913 employees. The 
most notable difference in Central and South America is how Large organizations have very large 
differences between Behaviors (85\) and the other dimensions. Further, it is worrying to see how 
all organizations are struggling with the Cognition and Responsibility dimensions. These very low 
scores strongly suggest the need for more frequent training and assessments, and a focus on the 
need for every employee to take security seriously. 
Another interesting observation is how in Medium organizations, the dimension of Norms is spiking at 
79, much higher than any other region. This is likely due to the sample size, but we will be watching 
this closely in the future to learn more about why this is appearing. 
Security Culture in
Central and South America
Central American countries show a wide 
variation of security culture scores, with 
Mexico performing better than most. 
Sample sizes in many Central American 
countries are low, suggesting that most 
organizations do not have a minimum level 
of security measures in place. It is our strong 
recommendation that organizations in these 
regions implement adequate security culture 
measures, including training and assessments. 
Most of South America reflected low security 
culture scores, with the notable exception of 
Colombia (77\). We observe that the continent 
as a whole is starting to measure security culture, with more countries being added every year. 
Still, the low sample rate across the continent suggests that there is a long way to go, and organizations 
need to ramp up their security game.

Security Culture Industry Trends
New to our 2022 report is a comparative view of how security culture trends over periods of 
time, specifically from 2019\-2021\. The following snapshots will highlight movement and provide 
an understanding of how each industry fares on the Security Culture Index (SCI). Comprehensive 
details of each industry sector can be found on the corresponding Industry Benchmark pages for 
that industry sector.
Global Trends as Seen Across the Dimensions of Security Culture
When looking at security culture only by its total score, it seems like nothing has changed in the 
past three years. With a global, average score of 73, security culture seems stagnant. Our ability 
to measure across the seven dimensions of security culture provides us with a unique perspective 
into exactly how security culture changes over time, and as can be observed in the figure below, 
we see that security culture has indeed changed quite a bit since 2019\.

Security Culture
Figure 20: Global trends in security culture.
Using the detailed breakdown, we see improvements in the dimensions of Behaviors, Cognition and 
Norms. These are all crucial dimensions that look into what employees are learning (Cognition), 
seeing others do (Behaviors) and their sense of the unwritten rules (Norms) governing security. These 
three dimensions are closely related, and their influence on each other is strong. This suggests that as 
more companies are training their employees more frequently, the better security they will achieve. 
24
When examining the other dimensions, the changes are either neutral or negative. Communication 
seems quite stable and is the best performer across the world. Compliance also seems to be quite 
stable. However, if we look at Responsibilities, we see a strong drop from 2019 to 2020\. When 
considered along with Attitudes, that also shows a similar size drop, we suggest that organizations 
focus on making employees feel that they are a strong, positive force that can help secure their 
workplace against cyber attacks and threats.

The Consulting sector continues to show erratic movement in SCS year\-over\-year, making progress in 
2020 (76 to 78\), however dropping 3 points to a 75 in 2021\. With a sample size of 55 organizations 
and 10,544 employees, Consulting remains mid\-Moderate in rating.
The Education sector had nominal improvement from 2019 to 2020 (69\-70\), remaining at 70 for 
1\. Although the one\-point change in score moved this sector from a Mediocre SCI rating to 
Moderate, more needs to be done to position this sector more favorably. The Education sector 
represents 50 organizations with 9,081 employees. 
Data on the Legal sector was not available in 2019 and although two years of data (2020 and 
1\. is not statistically valid in providing trends, we did notice slight favorable movement from 
70 to 72\. With 20 organizations representing 1,673 employees, we will continue to monitor Legal 
sector data to mark additional movement within the Moderate SCI range. 
The Technology sector, having one of the larger data sets in our research, with 214 organizations 
and 35,008 employees, continues to maintain a strong Moderate score. With an SCI decrease 
from 2019 (76\) to 2020 (75\), the Technology sector regained a score of 76 in 2021\.

Industry Benchmark
In this section of the report, we describe the security culture scores of each industry sector in detail. 
Use this section to get a deep dive into specific industries, and as a benchmark to compare your 
own scores against those of different industry sectors.
Benchmark Overview
Security culture varies across industries. In the industry comparison section, we compare all industries 
according to their security culture scores. We also compare the industries across each of the seven 
dimensions of security culture.
This overview provides direct 
insights into the difference 
across the industry sectors 
and allows for you to compare 
your organization to others. 
You can also use this section to 
compare your industry score 
with other industry sectors.
Industry Benchmark
Compared to previous 
years, we see that the worst 
performing sector of Education 
now has moved into the 
Moderate security culture 
range, with its score of 70\. The 
same is true with the Energy 
and Utilities, Manufacturing, and Retail and Wholesale industries. This is great news, as it means 
that there are no industry sectors that show Poor or Mediocre security culture. This is the first time 
we have not reported industries with a Poor or Mediocre security culture. Worryingly, not much 
improvement is seen on the other end of the spectrum. Instead, some sectors show a decline in security 
culture, most notably Business Services, with a drop from 78 in 2019 to their current score of 74\.

Banking
Banking institutions experienced an increase in cyber attacks, which elevate 
operational risks. Many of these attacks continue to utilize phishing emails to 
obtain remote access to conduct ransomware or business email compromise 
attacks. The pandemics impact continues to reverberate throughout the 
banking sector as the industry adapts to additional compliance obligations. 
In November 2021, the federal government ruled that banking organizations 
must notify their primary federal regulator within 36 hours in the event of 
certain types of computer security incidents. Additionally, 2021 brought the 
conclusion of COVID\-19\-related assistance programs. These adjustments can 
provide opportunities for new social engineering attempts against banking 
infrastructure. The industrys consistent Security Culture Score of 76 bodes 
well for their approach to overall risk management strategy and defense 
against emerging threats.
Survey results reveal a number of areas in which the Banking sector has 
improved with minor, positive shifts in multiple dimensions. In the past year, 
the Norms dimension increased by two points (74\) while both Behavior (78\) 
and Communication (78\) also increased by a single point, consistent with the 
Banking industrys history of strong communications channels. Responsibility 
(72\), Cognition (73\) and Compliance (79\) are consistent with last years 
report. All scores remain in the 
Moderate range.
Areas for Improvement
The only area for improvement
the Attitudes dimension
experienced a downward trend 
over the last three years from 80 
to 77
. This may be attributed 
to ongoing COVID\-19 
exhaustion as the industry 
continues to manage personnel 
hybrid working and the ongoing 
safety protocols required for 
in\-person operations. Banking 
sector security advocates can 
reverse this trend through 
targeted security awareness 
campaigns spearheaded by 
senior leadership, and focused on the vital role everyone plays in protecting high value financial 
data and maintaining a strong security culture.

Business Services
The Business Services sector represents a wide range of organizations typically 
offering assistance in areas such as office administration, physical security, 
waste disposal, cleaning services and hiringplacing personnel, which makes 
for an interesting mix in overall measurement of descriptive statistics. As an 
industry historically prone to a high percentage of targeted phishing attacks, 
we saw the Security Culture Score remain constant this year at a moderate 
1\. In an industry built heavily on relationships, the threat of a cyber attack 
could potentially damage existing customer relationships, disrupt customer 
loyalty and prevent new business opportunities.
The dimension of Behavior remained unchanged this year at 74, still 
considered Moderate on the scale. The Cognition dimension also remained 
unchanged at 71, and although is in the low\-Moderate range, is close to 
falling to Mediocre. If organizations within the Business Services sector fail 
to provide their employees with the necessary tools to best understand how 
and why they should be more security aware, then the Behavior dimension 
will certainly be negatively affected. Survey results also reflect a one\-point 
increase in the Norms dimension (from 73 to 74\), indicating that employees 
have the capacity to uphold unwritten rules of conduct when trained to do so. 
Areas for Improvement
The Business Services industry 
saw declines in the following 
dimensions in 2021: Attitude 
(76 to 75\), Communication 
(80 to 78\), Compliance (75 
to 74\) and Responsibility 
(72 to 71\). Although most of 
these downward trends seem 
nominal, as a whole, they 
indicate that there are inherent 
challenges in demonstrating an 
eagerness and commitment to 
improvement. 
A strong commitment to 
comprehensive and continuous 
training and education will 
favorably impact these scores 
and position the organizations within this industry to create a stronger security culture. Increased 
training and awareness will help strengthen employee understanding and buy\-in for security\-related 
behaviors and values.

Construction
The Construction sector continues to face hardships due to pandemic\-related 
delays of the most basic goods and materials needed to conduct their 
operations. Their overall supply chain continues to be challenged by inflexible 
business operations and practices, political indecision and continued shortage 
of trained labor. This, coupled with the ease at which ransomware attacks 
occur, makes this industry an obvious and attainable target. The Construction 
sector, which often includes a complex collection of contractors (both supply 
chain and on\-site), scored a low\-Moderate 71, however is increasingly close 
to falling into the Mediocre portion of the scale. 
The only dimension to see an increase from last year is Norms (70 to 71\). 
This increase does not stand out as favorable because the score still ranks 
at the very bottom of the Moderate range. Cybercriminals will continue to 
attack industries they know are vulnerable. Construction organizations need 
to carefully evaluate their ability to drive favorable movement across all 
dimensions, leading the charge with awareness and training.
Areas for Improvement
The Construction industry saw declines in five dimensions in 2021: Attitude (72 
to 71\), Behaviors (72 to 71\), Communication (77 to 76\), Compliance (72 to 71\) 
and Responsibilities (69 to 68\). 
Although Cognition held steady 
at 67, it remains their lowest 
score. Many work environments 
in this industry are not conducive 
to traditional computer\-based 
training because much of the 
workforce is widely dispersed 
on job sites without access to 
computers andor centrally 
managed, handheld devices. 
Options with mobile training 
continue to improve, but 
have not yet been universally 
embraced and deployed. The 
Construction industry needs to 
continue finding non\-traditional 
ways (including mobile\-first 
options) to drive awareness 
and raise employees levels of readiness to detect cyber attacks.

Consulting
The Consulting sector, with an overall security culture score of 75, continues 
to be a very attractive, high\-profile target for cybercriminals. In August 2021, 
one of the largest global consulting groups, was hit with a massive $50 
million ransomware attack by the group LockBit with help from an internal 
source (insider threat). The reputation and brand damage that this very public 
attack brings is staggering.
Consulting companies are data rich, and clients expect elevated levels 
of confidentiality, which may prove challenging with the high\-paced and 
stressful environment in this sector. This industry dropped in every dimension 
since last year, yet their scores are still favorable at mid\-high Moderate. 
The strongest scores were in Communication (79\) and Attitude (76\). With 
Communication being a cornerstone in the Consulting sector, it is likely that 
employees understand their respective roles and what is expected of them 
relative to securing their environment.
Areas for Improvement
The two lowest dimensions for the Consulting industry are Responsibilities 
(72\) and Cognition (73\). With Cognition, it is likely that employees possess 
adequate understanding of what their roles and responsibilities are regarding 
driving a more secure culture. 
Employees know that they 
need security training, but the 
program should deploy content 
at the right time, in the right 
way, to the already receptive 
audience. The challenge is 
not whether they understand 
their role, it is if they perceive 
their role as a critical element 
in preventing a cyber attack. 
Leaders need to ensure that 
their employees can make the 
leap from understanding to 
doing through continued and 
comprehensive awareness and 
training engagement.

Consumer Services
The Consumer Services industry has an overall security culture score of 73\. 
Organizations in the Consumer Services sector typically offer support\-based 
products that are not physical in nature, making for an interesting mix in 
overall measurement of descriptive statistics. Companies in this sector are 
traditionally behind in the adoption of new technology and upgrading their 
overall security infrastructureoperations and are often seen as attractive 
targets by cybercriminals due to their reduced resilience to attack.
Although this sector experienced drops in every dimension with the exception 
of Norms (72 to 73\), they still have Moderate scores in the following: Attitude 
(74\), Behavior (73\), Communication (78\) and Compliance (73\). Based on 
these scores, organizations in the Consumer Services industry should harness 
the positive attitudes their employees have, coupled with their willingness to 
behave in a more security\-minded fashion. Having a dispersed workforce 
requires these organizations to use creative techniques to pull employees 
into a place where they feel like part of the overall team.
Areas for Improvement
The two dimensions that reside within the Mediocre portion of the scale are 
Cognition (69\) and Responsibilities (69\). The ongoing pandemic continues to 
challenge Consumer Services 
organizations because their 
workforce is still heavily shifting 
to work from home, and in an 
industry that struggles with 
updated technology, that 
combination of distraction 
and weakened defenses 
are an attractive target for 
cybercriminals. Additionally, 
if employees are remote and 
without proper training and 
technology, they cannot operate 
as an integral part of the human 
firewall. Furthermore, they 
likely will not be equipped to 
translate that role into personal 
responsibility and the actions 
that they must take to be more 
security ready.

Education
Cyber attacks on schools and colleges, particularly targeting kindergarten 
through twelfth grade (K\-12\) institutions, have grown more frequent during the 
pandemic due to their increased reliance on technology. Public school systems 
often face limited budgets for cybersecurity tools, training and other resource 
constraints which make them an inviting target of ransomware attacks which 
can render systems inoperable. These attacks have also resulted in theft of 
confidential student data and the disruption of distance learning services. This 
increased threat environment requires that educational leadership, information 
technology personnel and security personnel will need to balance this risk 
when determining their cybersecurity investments. Educational institutions 
maintained last years Security Culture Score of 70, a score on the verge 
of falling down into the Mediocre range, which underscores the need for 
increased investment in several aspects of security culture. 
Norms saw a noteworthy increase of two points (70\) while Cognition also 
increased to 68, a one\-point difference over last year. Behavior (69\) and 
Communication (73\) remained consistent with last years scores.
Areas for Improvement
The Attitudes dimension (73\) has 
maintained its downward trend 
for the third year in a row and 
Responsibility (67\) has taken 
a slight downturn one point 
from last years survey, both are 
likely attributable to COVID\-19 
exhaustion. With increased 
funds for COVID\-19 testing 
and hygiene protocols, and if 
schools maintain their return to 
in\-person status, we can expect 
these dimensions will return to 
their pre\-pandemic scores. As 
with last year, Education ranked 
last (along with Hospitality) in 
our industry comparisons. The 
incremental improvements noted 
above indicate the Education 
sector is moving in the right direction towards improvements in security culture.

Energy and Utilities
The critical nature of Energy and Utilities was the subject of international 
headlines in the Spring of 2021\. This was due to the largest cyber attack on 
an oil infrastructure target in the history of the United States, the Colonial 
Pipeline. In response, many companies in the sector sought cyber insurance 
coverage amid increased engagement with government regulators\[1]. In 
addition, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published 
updated guidelines to help organizations align compliance and security 
programs to better manage risk\[2]. The incident also highlighted the criticality 
of security planning and incident response across private and public sectors, 
which likely contributed to the increases in multiple security dimensions this 
year. The industrys overall Security Culture Score remains steadfast at a 
low\-Moderate 71\.
Four of the seven dimensions measured showed incremental improvement 
over last years survey. Behaviors (72\), Cognition (67\), Compliance (72\) 
and Norms (70\) have increased by one point but are either in or moving 
towards the Mediocre range. Communication remains the industrys strongest 
dimension at 75\.
Areas for Improvement
The Attitudes dimension dropped 
from last year, down from 74 to 
72, which may be attributed to 
the negative effects on industry 
morale by the high profile nature 
of recent ransomware attacks. 
As noted in previous Security 
Culture Reports, the Energy \& 
Utilities sector has much room 
for improvement. This year, it 
is ranked in the bottom, only 
one point behind Education 
and Hospitality at 70\. While 
incremental improvement 
has occurred in the last year, 
the vital nature of this sector 
necessitates a greater emphasis 
on continuous security training 
and testing, while providing constructive feedback to employees.

Financial Services
The Financial Services sector maintained their Moderate Security Culture 
score of 75, and continues to have strong Moderate scores across each 
dimension. Within this industry, controlling trades and governing significant 
amounts of money while housing highly confidential financial and personal 
client information, makes them a high value target. The past few years have 
been painful for the Financial Services sector, with Experian experiencing 
a loss of 24 million customers and 800,000 business records, and Capital 
One losing 100 million credit card applications\[1]. These are just two of the 
many Financial Services companies that have been successfully compromised.
As companies in this sector continue to adapt to new pandemic\-era remote 
and hybrid working conditions, the safety of normal business functions remains 
under scrutiny. Cyber attacks will not stop in this sector. Financial Services 
organizations need to adopt robust, multi\-layered defense strategies and 
immerse their employees in comprehensive and continuous security awareness 
training to increase employee resilience to social engineering attacks. The 
highest scoring dimensions were Communication (78\), Attitude (77\), Behavior 
(77\) and Compliance (77\), highlighting that engaged employees believe, 
behave and follow security policies.
Areas for Improvement
The least favorable dimensions 
of the Financial Services 
industry are Responsibilities 
(72\) followed by Cognition 
(73\). Cybercriminals continue 
to exploit organizations 
with untrained users, lower 
comprehension levels and 
click\-happy employees. 
If an employees overall 
understanding is low, then there 
is a high probability that they 
lack needed resilience in the 
face of a cyber attack. Security 
awareness training combined 
with ongoing simulated 
phishing tests are critical to 
help employees build the muscle memory and gut instincts needed to sort the good from the bad.

Government
At the federal level, the Department of Defense (DoD) released their 
Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) for use in assessing the 
cybersecurity environment of DoDs vendor supply chain. Additionally, the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) continues to update 
enterprise risk management\[1] guidance on how federal agencies should 
utilize the Cybersecurity Framework\[2]. State and local governments face 
the challenges of a multi\-tiered regulatory environment and an expanding 
attack surface. Although recent legislation allocated billions of dollars in 
cybersecurity\[3] funding from this grant program, it will take time for the funds 
to make their way to intended recipients. There were improvements in several 
dimensions, resulting in a slight increase to a low\-Moderate 72 score.
The noteworthy improvement of five out of seven dimensions throughout the 
government is likely due, at least in part, to the high profile nature of the SolarWinds\-
related malware attack. In December 2020, the U.S. government issued an 
Emergency Directive in response to a known compromise involving SolarWinds 
Orion products. The attack was unprecedented and a significant cyber incident 
impacting enterprise networks across federal, state, and local governments, as 
well as critical infrastructure entities and other private sector organizations.\[4] 
This intrusion was subsequently attributed to the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service (SVR)\[5]. That a foreign intelligence service targeted local\-level networks, 
impacted awareness throughout 
the Government sector. Three 
dimensions improved by two 
pointsBehavior (73\), Cognition 
(69\), Compliance (74\)while 
Communication (76\) and Norms 
(71\) increased by one.
Areas for Improvement
The Attitude (74\) dimension, 
though traditionally the 
strongest dimension among 
Government, was unchanged 
from last years survey. The 
Responsibility (68\) dimension, 
traditionally the weakest, also 
remained unchanged. The Government workforce can gain a stronger sense of responsibility for 
security culture by leveraging additional training and awareness to educate users on threats by 
foreign intelligence services and other bad actors against federal, state and local infrastructure.

Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals
Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals organizations have long been vigilant in 
the protection of intellectual property and financial information. However, 
the rapidly expanded use of telemedicine has increased the amount of data 
available through patient and healthcare provider portals and apps. These 
changes in providerpatient use of technology result in an increased attack 
surface; this can impact data ranging from personally identifiable information 
(PII) to intellectual property (IP), such as extremely valuable drug research 
efforts. Moreover, medical identity theft, which often includes both a patients 
social security and credit card number(s), are highly lucrative endeavors for 
cybercriminals. Compounding the threat is a need for medical providers to 
maintain immediate access to patient data; institutions often pay a ransomware 
attacker to regain access, which also makes this industry an attractive target 
to malicious actors. The industrys overall results remain consistent over the 
last two years, with a Moderate Security Culture Score of 74\. 
Last years Security Culture Report noted a need for improvement in the 
Norms dimension, which measures the unwritten rules related to security 
expectations and how employees are adopting them. This year, Norms (74\), 
as well as Cognition (72\) improved by two points. The Behavior dimension 
(76\) also improved by one point. Although consistent with last years scores, 
Attitude and Communication maintain a strong showing (77\). 
Areas for Improvement
The Responsibility (70\) and 
Compliance (74\) dimensions 
remain unchanged. There 
are several opportunities for 
improvement, particularly 
Responsibility, which is on the 
verge of dropping into the 
Mediocre range of the scale. 
This dimension measures an 
employees understanding of 
the safeguards they provide, 
as those safeguards relate to 
their organizations security 
posture, which is required by 
federal and state regulations 
to include the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996\. The industry would benefit from additional 
training to understand how professional security measures translate into a safer personal home 
environment as well.

Hospitality
In past years, the Marriott chain, The Ritz London hotel, MGM Resorts and 
Choice Hotels International were hit with major security breaches\[1]. This is 
just a sample of the many breaches that occurred in the Hospitality industry. 
In these cases, cybercriminals were looking for private information (i.e credit 
card, emails and other personal data) of guests booking reservations through 
online portals, check inout and meal services. Additionally, with the sheer 
volume of people going in and out of hotels and restaurants, it is difficult to 
keep track of authorized access for employees and guests, making it easier 
to infiltrate physical environments.
With an overall security culture score of 70, the Hospitality industry maintains 
its spot as a preferred target and joins Education for the lowest Security 
Culture Score.
There is a three\-way tie of the highest rated dimensions: Attitude (73\), 
Behavior (73\) and Communication (73\), but still at low\-Moderate on the 
scale. These scores make it clear that employees have a strong willingness 
to help build and be part of a more secure culture. Through communication 
and jobspecific awareness and training, employees can raise their readiness 
levels to spot different physical and cybersecurity threats.
Areas for Improvement
Cognition (66\) is the lowest 
ranked dimension with 
Compliance and Responsibilities 
not far behind at 67\. More 
frequent and consistent training 
is needed to ensure that 
employees understand what 
the inherent risks are within 
their respective environments 
and what steps they can 
take to mitigate those risks. 
Understanding, coupled with 
enacting policies and guidelines 
that outline what is expected, 
will help minimize the current 
gap. Hectic work environments 
need security aware employees.

Insurance
Cyber attacks in the Insurance segment continue to grow due to the amount of 
personal, financial and medical information retained by these organizations. 
In contrast to other sectors, which hold mainly sensitive financial data, 
insurers typically also collect a large amount of protected personal sensitive 
information\[1]. In March 2021, one of the largest insurers, CNA Financial 
Corp paid $40 million in ransom to reclaim control of their networks after 
a targeted cyber attack.\[2]
The Insurance sector has some of the highest dimension scores across all of 
the industries surveyed. With an overall score of 76, the following dimensions 
are among their highest: Communication (80\), Attitude (78\) and Compliance 
(77\). Communication and Compliance are key in this industry. Employees 
need to understand and always adhere to security policies. Additionally, 
this is a highly regulated industry and insurers need to make certain that 
they always meet regulatory standards. Additionally, having accurate and 
timely information to respond to policyholders is critical in order to promote 
assurance in their business transactions.
Areas for Improvement
The lowest dimension score is 
Responsibilities at a Moderate 
1\. In Perry Carpenters book, 
Transformational Security 
Awareness, Carpenter notes, 
Just because I am aware, 
doesnt mean that I care.\[3] 
Meaning, employees could be 
following security policies and 
understand their role in better 
securing the organization, but 
still may not care. Making a 
strong connection between 
what they need to know and 
do, and how this knowledge 
will benefit them personally, is 
a strong recipe to gain buy\-in.

Legal
Law firms continue to be a favorite target of cybercriminals. An October 
2021 American Bar Association report found 29% of law firms reported 
a security breach, with more than 1 in 5 saying they werent sure if there 
had ever been a breach and 36% reporting past malware infections in their 
systems.\[1] With an overall security score of 72, law firms hold significant 
amounts of confidential and sensitive information available now online 
compared to law firms of the past which relied on physical copies. Law 
firms are also fighting a double\-edged sword: not only does the firm suffer 
monetary and reputational damages when compromised, but they could 
also face significant fines for failure to follow government regulations.
The highest dimensions in the Legal sector are Communication (78\), Compliance 
(74\) and Attitude (74\). Law firms excel at communicating and leverage that 
critical skill to ensure the entire firm understands and has access to what they 
need. Employees are well versed in policies and believe it is their responsibility 
to ensure the organization is well protected.
Areas for Improvement
The two lowest dimensions are Behaviors (67\) and Norms (69\), both of which 
are Mediocre on the Security Culture Index. The dimension of Behaviors had 
a three point drop from last 
year, which may be attributed 
to pandemic required remote 
work environments. Again, 
employees may fully understand 
and comply with policies, 
but they need to know how 
to translate that into action. 
As with last years findings, 
it is important to note the 
correlation between Behaviors 
and Norms; an increased focus 
on reinforcing Norms to drive 
desired Behaviors, particularly 
in the current remote work 
environment, is recommended.

Manufacturing
The pandemic\-fueled rapid evolution of digital technology to support supply 
chain operations introduced greater vulnerabilities across the Manufacturing 
sector. According to the Department of Homeland Security, a direct attack 
on, or disruption of certain elements of the manufacturing industry could 
disrupt essential functions at the national level and across multiple critical 
infrastructure sectors.\[1] Global supply chains are investing heavily in software 
to better ensure the availability of reliable data for lean or just in time 
manufacturing practices which have fallen under scrutiny for COVID\-related 
shortages. Stakeholders must ensure their workforce is provided with the 
digital skills and security culture mindset necessary to match the industrys 
increasingly on\-demand environment. Again, these rapidly evolving factors 
are attributed to the Manufacturing sectors low\-Moderate score of 71 for 
the third year in a row.
The Manufacturing sector experienced a notable two point increase in both 
Behavior and Norms over last years research as employees have adapted to 
some changes within the industry. The Communication dimension remained 
consistent (74\) and remains the strongest dimension in the industry for the 
third year in a row.
Areas for Improvement
Although better than last year, 
Cognition remains at a Mediocre 
rating (68\) on the scale, 
indicating an elevated need for 
security awareness, as well as 
an increased understanding of 
how their cyber hygiene affects 
the Manufacturing industrys 
overall security posture. This 
correlates with the also sub\-
par rating for Responsibility 
(69\), which indicates a need 
for increased messaging to 
employees building their sense 
of personal responsibility for a 
stronger security culture.

Not\-for\-Profit
Nonprofits have long been considered an easy target among cybercriminals. 
With an overall low\-Moderate score of 72, Not\-for\-Profit organizations 
typically have lean operating budgets focused on marketing campaigns 
supporting their charter, which results in budgetary restraints on IT operations. 
As a result, cybersecurity is often neglected.
Communication remains the highest dimension for Not\-for\-Profits (76\), 
followed by Attitude (74\).
Since communicating is a critical component of building a strong security 
culture, it is important that Not\-for\-Profits push security information to the 
right audiences at the right time, both internal and external, raising employee 
readiness while increasing donor long\-term trust and confidence.
Areas for Improvement
The lowest dimension in the Notfor\-Profit sector is Responsibility (69\) 
followed by Cognition (70\). Not\-for\-Profits focus on acquiring funds and
or material items to improve the quality of life for a target population. These 
organizations tend not to have investment dollars to put into securing their 
digital environments.
Therefore, personnel and 
volunteers have varied levels 
of security awareness and best 
practices. Not\-for\-Profits will 
benefit from leveraging low 
cost or free security tools that 
are developed for their specific 
needs, reducing IT operational 
costs as a barrier.

Retail and Wholesale
The Retail and Wholesale sector has various compliance requirements ranging 
from PCI, SOX and HIPAA to various state privacy regulations, yet they remain 
an attractive focus for cybercriminals. Targets ranging from vulnerable Point 
of Sale (POS) systems to malicious software (malware) attacks via supply 
chain vendors (who often have trusted access to the corporate network) 
provide cybercriminals troves of user and credit card data. Social media 
and digital payment technologies also provide a host of new challenges. 
Whether it is social media\-enabled social engineering approaches or the 
implementation of digital wallets (often in support of contact\-free payments) 
and cryptocurrencies, the attack surface continues to expand for this sector. 
This underscores the need for ongoing investment in information security 
and employee training. The Retail and Wholesale sector scored one point 
over last year (71\), indicating a continued need for improving the industrys 
security mindset.
The dimensions Behavior (73\) and Norms (71\) enjoyed the strongest gains 
in this years survey, both increasing by two points. These organizations had 
to adapt faster because of the keeping the doors open effect for retail, yet 
straddling hybrid environments for officesupport functions. Attitude (73\) 
gained only slightly while both Communication (75\) and Compliance (71\) 
remained consistent with last years findings.
Areas for Improvement
Responsibility dropped one 
point (68\) remaining at a 
Mediocre rating, indicating 
that a strong emphasis
reinforced through a variety 
of communications channelsis 
needed for employees in the 
Retail and Wholesale sector 
to personalize the need for an 
improved security culture. The 
Cognition score improved two 
points (68\), but also remains a 
Mediocre rating, underscoring 
the need to engage employees 
with relevant security awareness 
training.

Technology
The COVID\-19 pandemic created massiveand likely permanentchanges 
in the Technology sector. Throughout 2021, COVID\-19 variants hindered 
return\-to\-office plans, forcing the industry to reconsider their company policies 
and work cultures in the face of partial or full\-time permanent remote work. In 
addition, these changes led to major technology and human capital investments 
to allow workers to securely connect and collaborate from anywhere. The 
distributed, virtual nature of this new normal in business operations requires 
companies to reconsider their approach to security culture. In\-person training 
tools such as posters and fliers have given way to accelerated simulated social 
engineering testing and online gamification of security awareness training. 
This industry is particularly accustomed to rapid adjustments as exhibited in 
their return to the pre\-pandemic overall score of 76\.
Technology, as expected given their area of expertise, enjoys some of the 
strongest scores in this survey. Three dimensions improved over last years 
results. Norms enjoyed the greatest increase, three points over last year (77\). 
This dimension measures an organizations security\-related unwritten rules 
and acceptable behaviors and how those are reflected in the actions and 
values of employees. Communication (79\) and Compliance (74\) increased 
by one point, while Behavior (77\) and Cognition (74\) were consistent with 
last years survey findings.
Areas for Improvement
The Responsibility dimension 
remains in decline for the 
third consecutive year at 72 
while Attitude dropped one 
point to a still respectable 
77
. The ongoing downturn of 
the Responsibility dimension 
suggests a diverse messaging 
campaign to employees 
regarding the professional and 
personal benefits that a stronger 
security culture can bring could 
be in order. The slight drop in 
the Attitude dimension is likely 
related to the dramatic increase 
of ransomware and other headline worthy cyber attacks.

Transportation
The Transportation industry faces a number of logistical and technological 
challenges. Increased fuel costs, supply chain issues, carrier capacity, staffing 
and other industry demands have all weighed heavily upon the sector. 
Transportation encompasses several subsectors to include aviation, mass transit, 
maritime, rail, etc. that at times require coordinated efforts between public 
and private sector partners, each with their own unique characteristics and 
cultural landscape. This diverse landscape requires the need for an effective 
and sustainable security culture framework that stakeholders can adhere 
to in an effort to promote a stronger environment. There are many areas 
of improvement in this years research results, however, the Transportation 
industry remains at a moderately low 72\.
The industry has exhibited marked improvements over last years research. 
Communication (76\) is the dominant dimension. Behavior (73\) and Norms 
(72\) have improved each by two points. Though Compliance climbed three 
points to 71, there is still room for improvement. The Transportation industry 
would be well served building on their strong Communication dimension to 
generate consensus and cooperative relationships while furthering security 
culture strategies.
Areas for Improvement
Although a slight increase 
over last year, Cognition (68\) 
remains an area that requires 
additional attention, as well as 
Responsibility, which remains 
at 68both rate Mediocre 
on the survey. Recently passed 
legislation\[1] could help provide 
funding necessary to advocate 
for stronger industry\-wide 
security culture as a critical 
core business value throughout 
the Transportation sector.

The Security Culture Survey, 
and therefore this report, is created as a 
multilevel statistical analytics tool, 
where individual respondents are aggregated 
to the level of an organization.
49
About the Report
This report was created by KnowBe4 
Research using the highest research 
standards. The report leverages 
anonymized data from KnowBe4s 
Security Culture Survey. The sample size 
represents 2,910 surveyed organizations 
around the world, with more than 
530,356 employees across 18 industry 
sectors, effectively making this the largest 
report of its kind published to date.
Methodology
Below is a description of the methods 
used to analyze the data, along with 
descriptive tables.
How Data Was Collected
The data for this report was collected using the Security Culture Survey, which is available 
to KnowBe4 customers via the Kevin Mitnick Security Awareness Training (KMSAT) platform. 
The Security Culture Survey was developed by CLTRe based on a scientific approach that 
integrates survey methodology, statistics and scientific findings from security culture research 
and psychometrics. The survey consists of four items for each distinct dimension of security 
culture, a total of 28 items; and the question set and methodology have been refined over 
several years. The data collection period was from 2019 to 2021 and represents customers from 
around the globe. The data for this report is based on a single data collection time point for 
each employee and was then anonymized and aggregated. All data analysis was performed 
in the software environment R (r\-project.org).
Data Preprocessing
To ensure validity and reliability, the data was cleaned before any calculations were conducted. A 
listwise deletion of missing data was conducted, which means that responses with missing values 
were deleted.
Furthermore, respondents who used less than two minutes on the survey were excluded, as they 
would not have taken the time to read questions before answering. Organizations with less than 10 
valid employee responses were excluded, as these were considered accounts for testing the survey 
and thus do not measure a representative proportion of the organization.

Statistical Analyses
The values that employees provide on the 28 security culture items are transformed into eight metrics 
for each organization. The first seven metrics correspond to each of the seven security culture 
dimensions. The final metric is the Security Culture Score, which is calculated by taking the mean 
of all the dimension scores. All scores have a range from zero to 100\.
The Security Culture Survey, and therefore this report, is created as a multi\-level statistical analytics 
tool, where individual respondents are aggregated to the level of an organization. One of the 
benefits of aggregating scores to an organization level rather than at the employee level, is that 
the effects of organization size on industry benchmarks were neutralized. The unique algorithm for 
this transformation was designed by CLTRe and based on a complex conceptual understanding of 
organizational security culture.
After statistical analysis, the scores were compared to the Security Culture Index. The Security Culture 
Index is the scale used to measure security culture, and consists of these five levels:
Poor
Mediocre
Moderate
Good
Excellent
0 up to 60
60 up to 70
70 up to 80
80 up to 90
90 up to 100
Data Size
The data consists of 530,356 employees and 2,910 organizations. For the trends analysis, the final 
sample after data cleaning consisted of 514,575 employees and 2,656 organizations that completed 
the Security Culture Survey. For the industry benchmarks for 2021, the final sample consisted of 
257,546 employees and 1,456 organizations that completed the Security Culture Survey. Data 
was collected from 68 countries.
