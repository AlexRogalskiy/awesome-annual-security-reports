GRIT
Ransomware Report2 0 2 2A NNUA LR EPOR TMethodologyData collected for this report was obtained from publiclyavailable resources, including threat groups themselves,and has not been validated by alleged victims. Thus, thenumber of publicly observed attacks and the actualnumber of attacks conducted may not be equal. Somegroups do not publicize all of their victims and almost allgroups offer an option to withhold announcement if thevictim pays a ransom within a specified timeframeandor remove the victims once a ransom has been paid.Additionally, some groups exaggerate their numbers byincluding incomplete information about their victim orclaiming an attack despite successfully attacking only asmall subset of their target. For these reasons, the datain this report is useful in aggregate, but should beevaluated as a report consisting of data sources thathave variability. Despite the variability, this report is stillan accurate representation of the total ransomwarethreat landscape.ContentsIntroducing the GRIT Ransomware 
Group TaxonomyRansomware Trends Across 2022Threat Actor Activity BreakdownMajor Events and ObservationsQ4 Ransomware RecapRansomware Predictions for 2023ConclusionA NNUA LRansomware 
Summary2022 was yet another year with ransomware topping the charts as the most prolific and impactful threat to our networks, 
data, and operational capabilities. With 2,507 publicly posted victims across 40 industry verticals, ransomware groups were 
responsible for publicly posting 6\.87 victims per day to their respective leak sites. GRIT tracked 54 groups utilizing a double\-
extortion methodology, many of which are utilizing a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) model to increase productivity and 
maximize revenue.The first quarter of 2022 started high with a posting rate that mirrored the value of Bitcoin, and as the price of Bitcoin became 
more volatile, so did the rates of victim postings, to a degree. Despite the volatility of cryptocurrency, ransomware victim 
postings remained frequent, as no quarter saw less than 569 total victims. Significant events, including the rebranding of 
Conti and the change in version from Lockbit2 to Lockbit3, also influenced the rates of ransomware victims and led to some 
volatility; however, yearly trends show that 2022 ended on a high note for ransomware groups.Unsurprisingly, as 2022 progressed, the United States and other western countries were the main targets of ransomware 
groups. Western countries made up 77% of all publicly posted victims in 2022, with the United States accounting for 38\.9% 
of total victims claimed by ransomware groups.Similarly, the manufacturing and technology industries were consistently the most targeted industries, with construction and 
healthcare following close behind. Much of the top 10 most targeted industries remained consistent during 2022, although 
there was some movement within the top targeted industries from month to month.As GRITs methodology introduced the concept of ransomware group categories, we began to take a deeper and more 
granular look into how ransomware groups operate, how they target, and some of the characteristics that make them unique. 
To kick this annual report off, we will cover the ransomware group taxonomy we created over the course of the year, then 
well dive deep into 2022 to examine ransomware statistics and trends. If you just want a breakdown of the Q4 numbers, 
well separate those out after the annual review. Finally, well finish with a look at 2023 with some predictions of what we 
can expect, as ransomware will likely continue to be front and center as the most impactful cybersecurity threat we must 
defend against on a daily basis.Total Publicly Posted Ransomware VictimsNumber of Tracked Ransomware GroupsAverage Posting Rate (per day)2,507546\.87Ransomware TaxonomyAs 2022 progressed, we realized that ransomware groups couldDuring our continuous monitoring, we now reclassify groups asbe divided into subtypes based on their behaviors and operationalthey progress in their operational maturity.

11\.2One of the strongest correlationsthat we found when analyzing thedata for all of 2022 was the linkbetween victim posting rates andthe price of Bitcoin.Due to the way that groups tend togroup their victim postings, therate of posting doesnt seem tocorrelate to Bitcoin at first. Butwhen we used a 4 period movingaverage to normalize the postingrates, the link became clear.This suggests that threat groupsclosely monitor Bitcoin prices andincrease operations while Bitcoinprices are high to maximize profits.Likewise, it suggests that threatgroups may slow down operationswhile Bitcoin prices are morevolatile to reduce potential losses.Rate of Publicly Posted Ransomware

However, there is strong correlationbetween BlackBastas TTPs and the now\-defunct Conti, sotheir presence as a Rebrand is less surprising in this ranking.Alongside Vice Societys strong presence in Healthcaretargeting, they also accounted for more than 13rd of allEducation victims (48 out of 143\) for the year.

America compared to Splinter and Ephemeral groups, which were both exclusively focused on 
Brazil and Columbia.Outside of targeting the United States, Full\-Time and Rebrand groups are more likely to focus 
their efforts on western countries while Splinter and Ephemeral groups are much more evenly 
distributed around the world.All group types show a lack of targeting former Soviet Union countries.Major Events and Observations2022 RecapMajor Events and ObservationsIn Q1, the industry observed Contis internal struggles stemming from their back and forth support for Russia in 
their conflict with Ukraine.o This ultimately resulted in a massive leak of their playbooks, infrastructure, source code, and more that led to anunrecoverable state for the group.o Conti disbanded early in 2022 in favor of pursuing operations after a thorough rebranding process into groups such asBlackbasta, AlphV, and more. More ransomware groups are seeing the value of single extortion methodologyo Lockbit explicitly allows exfiltration of data of all industries, including critical infrastructureo More groups are seeing the benefits of leveraging data exfiltration for payment without encryption Vulnerability exploitation was solidified as one of the most effective methods of achieving initial access intovictim networkso Many critical vulnerabilities were either being exploited in the wild at the time of initial disclosure while othervulnerabilities were being weaponized within days of disclosure.o Organizations are hardly, if at all, able to keep up in their normal patching cycles.Major Events and ObservationsESXi encryption maintained a spot in the hearts of threat actorso Even splinter and ephemeral groups are seeing the advantages of targeting ESXi hypervisor servers as a means ofencrypting key parts of a victims infrastructure simultaneouslyo Groups of all maturities understand the value of hypervisors and are using these to put significant pressure on victimorganizations to pay ransoms Relationships with initial access brokers are becoming more apparent with ransomware groupso Ransomware groups are seeing the value of initial access brokers and are leveraging their access of personal andorganization owned devices to improve their operational efficiency and improve ROIThreat actors are still leveraging many of the same tactics and techniques to compromise victim organizationso Open RDP and SSH to the internet remain commonly exploited by threat actorso Unpatched and dated vulnerabilities are still being successfully leveraged for initial accessThreat actors continue to demonstrate their flexibilityo Microsofts change of default Office Macro behavior was a step in the right direction, but ultimately forced a rapidchange in initial delivery methods for email\-based attacks.Q4 Ransomware Trends RecapQ4 SummaryNow that weve taken a deep dive into overall ransomware activity in 2022, we wanted to take a step back and reviewthe activity we tracked during Q4 of 2022\.Q4 saw a rise back to Q1 victim posting rates after a two\-quarter slowdown in publicly observed activity. Lockbitcontinued its reign as the most impactful ransomware group, while new groups like Royal entered the double extortion 
realm with a bang. Major players like AlphV, Bian Lian, and Blackbasta maintained their presence in the top ransomwaregroups of the quarter with consistent activity.Interestingly, Lockbit publicly upheld their affiliate rules by banning an affiliate for encrypting a childrens hospital inCanada, while other groups, like Vice Society, continue to prove that no industry is off limits.As Q4 ended, we observed ransomware trends continue to hold their place as the most likely and impactful eCrimethreat that all organizations across all industries face.Total Publicly Posted Ransomware VictimsNumber of Tracked Ransomware GroupsAverage Posting Rate (per day)656307\.13Rate of Publicly Posted Ransomware Victimss

ViVictim posting rate was consistent 
in early Q4, but shortly after the 
mid\-November start of World Cup in 
Qatar the rate dropped sharply.The high number of groups active 
from week 42 through 47 also saw a 
steep drop after the World Cup, but 
the resurgence in mid\-December 
may correlate to a lull in new 
attacks as they negotiated with 
victims, followed by a surge in posts 
when negotiations went south.However, this pullback was short\-
lived, as we observed a surge in 
mid\-December before returning to 
the average posting rate of Q4\.Overall, Q4 saw a 15\.5% increase

Activity Q4 2022LockBit continues to be the most prolificransomware group in Q4, despite a slowdown invictim posting. They hit a daily high of 18 victimposts in October, which makes it their third highestposting day in all of 2022\. Compared to Q3, LockBitmade a significant shift away from targeting in thelegal industry this quarter.We observed a a 57% increase in AlphVs reportedvictims in Q4\. Alongside this increase, 34% of theirannual Manufacturing and Technology victims wereposted this quarter.Royals leak site went live at the beginning of Q4 inOctober, and by the end of the year had alreadyclaimed 63 victims. Despite their recent emergence,the group tied for the most targeting of the Food andBeverage industry in Q4\. Even with that focus, theirvictims span 24 industries across 14 countries.2023 Predictions2023 PredictionsFirst, we believe 2023 will continue to see an increase in 
ransomware rebranding.GRITs 2022 threat actor trends show an increase in 
rebrand, splinter, and ephemeral groups share of total 
victims as 2022 progressedThere has been at least one new group for every month 
of 2022, this will likely continue throughout 2023Second, vulnerabilities will continue to be heavily researched 
and utilized for initial intrusion into networks.The time to weaponization of these vulnerabilities is 
likely to decrease as 2023 progressesThird, as organizations rely on the fundamentals of security to 
establish effective security programs and make the threat actors' 
lives harder, ransomware groups will likely move to single extortion 
attempts based on exfiltration of data where no encryption event 
occurs. We believe this will be especially true for critical 
infrastructure and sensitive industries.Fourth, and this will aid in our second prediction, emerging 
technologies like ChatGPT, OpenAI, and others will be leveraged to 
automate social engineering and other initial intrusion capabilities.Finally, as multifactor authentication and zero trust architecture 
continue to be adopted, personal devices will likely be targeted to 
establish initial intrusions into business networks.Info stealers such as redline stealer, raccoon stealer, etc. will 
continue to be an extremely viable resource for threat actors to 
leverage as an initial intrusion vector.2022 Wrap UpAfter years of ransomware activity, it seems safe to say that ransomware is here to stay, for quite awhile at least. Ransomware groups areclaiming victims at a staggering rate and new ransomware groups are formed, and sometimes disbanded, on a monthly basis. At the end of theday, the ransomware problem is still very real.GRITs goal with this research is to educate cybersecurity professionals and leadership, and to encourage security researchers to continue towork together to further our defensive and threat intelligence capabilities. If we continue to share intelligence and establish open anddynamic methods of communication, its possible that we can start to keep up with the ransomware threat. Through collaboration, we canstart to be flexible and adaptable, just like our adversaries.Ransomware groups will continue to target us on a regular basis and leverage any means necessary to accomplish their goals, but that doesntmean its all doom and gloom moving forward. Through well\-established cybersecurity foundations we can start to limit the risk associatedwith unpatched vulnerabilities and lack of visibility. We can focus on ensuring coverage with our security tools and that our analysts andleadership are well equipped to handle potential incidents as they arise. Admittedly, this is a large task for almost any team, but, if we focuson small wins, and we maintain forward progress, we will make it exponentially more difficult for ransomware groups to be successful.GRIT has already begun researching ransomware trends in 2023 and we plan to continue to extend our research capabilities to give granularand informative insights into ransomware groups. Through our continued research we hope to disrupt ransomware groups by armingcybersecurity professionals with knowledge and intelligence.So, heres to 2023 and another successful year of intelligence sharing. Happy hunting!
