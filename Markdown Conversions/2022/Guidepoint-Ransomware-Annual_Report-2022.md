Ransomware Report
Methodology
Data collected for this report was obtained from publicly 
available resources, including threat groups themselves, 
and has not been validated by alleged victims. Thus, the 
number of publicly observed attacks and the actual 
number of attacks conducted may not be equal. Some 
groups do not publicize all of their victims and almost all 
groups offer an option to withhold announcement if the 
victim pays a ransom within a specified timeframe 
andor remove the victims once a ransom has been paid. 
Additionally, some groups exaggerate their numbers by 
including incomplete information about their victim or 
claiming an attack despite successfully attacking only a 
small subset of their target. For these reasons, the data 
in this report is useful in aggregate, but should be 
evaluated as a report consisting of data sources that 
have variability. Despite the variability, this report is still 
an accurate representation of the total ransomware 
threat landscape.

Summary
ANNUAL
2022 was yet another year with ransomware topping the charts as the most prolific and impactful threat to our networks, 
data, and operational capabilities. With 2,507 publicly posted victims across 40 industry verticals, ransomware groups were 
responsible for publicly posting 6\.87 victims per day to their respective leak sites. GRIT tracked 54 groups utilizing a double\-
extortion methodology, many of which are utilizing a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) model to increase productivity and 
maximize revenue.
The first quarter of 2022 started high with a posting rate that mirrored the value of Bitcoin, and as the price of Bitcoin became 
more volatile, so did the rates of victim postings, to a degree. Despite the volatility of cryptocurrency, ransomware victim 
postings remained frequent, as no quarter saw less than 569 total victims. Significant events, including the rebranding of 
Conti and the change in version from Lockbit2 to Lockbit3, also influenced the rates of ransomware victims and led to some 
volatility; however, yearly trends show that 2022 ended on a high note for ransomware groups.
Unsurprisingly, as 2022 progressed, the United States and other western countries were the main targets of ransomware 
groups. Western countries made up 77% of all publicly posted victims in 2022, with the United States accounting for 38\.9% 
of total victims claimed by ransomware groups.
Similarly, the manufacturing and technology industries were consistently the most targeted industries, with construction and 
healthcare following close behind. Much of the top 10 most targeted industries remained consistent during 2022, although 
there was some movement within the top targeted industries from month to month.
As GRITs methodology introduced the concept of ransomware group categories, we began to take a deeper and more 
granular look into how ransomware groups operate, how they target, and some of the characteristics that make them unique. 
To kick this annual report off, we will cover the ransomware group taxonomy we created over the course of the year, then 
well dive deep into 2022 to examine ransomware statistics and trends. If you just want a breakdown of the Q4 numbers, 
well separate those out after the annual review. Finally, well finish with a look at 2023 with some predictions of what we 
can expect, as ransomware will likely continue to be front and center as the most impactful cybersecurity threat we must 
defend against on a daily basis.

As 2022 progressed, we realized that ransomware groups could 
be divided into subtypes based on their behaviors and operational 
maturity. By subdividing ransomware groups, we are able to 
obtain more detailed insights into how ransomware groups 
progress in their level of operational maturity and gained the 
ability to classify and identify potential rebranding activity.
Throughout this annual ransomware report, and during 
subsequent monthly and quarterly reports, we will distinguish 
ransomware groups by placing them into these four categories:
During our continuous monitoring, we now reclassify groups as 
they progress in their operational maturity. There are multiple 
routes a group can take through the various classifications, and no 
one route is standard. While one group may begin as Ephemeral 
and move their way through the ranks to Full\-Time, another 
group may enter as a Rebrand as part of a larger obfuscation 
strategy to avoid attention from law enforcement.
We are sharing our ransomware group taxonomy definitions as 
part of this annual report with the hope that they will be used 
and further developed by others in the community. By using this 
taxonomy, we believe the community will be able to more easily 
identify ransomware rebranding and group behaviors, which
will lead to significant degradation in their capabilities to 
conduct operations.
 Full\-Time
 Rebrand
 Splinter 
 Ephemeral
Ransomware Taxonomy
FULL\-TIME: 
These groups have been active for nine or more months and often 
have months where they publicly claim 10 or more victims. Their 
standardized infrastructure and defined affiliate structure (if acting as 
a Ransomware as a Service) lead to consistent TTPs and behaviors 
with only slight variations based on ransomware operator.
Example: Lockbit
REBRAND: 
These groups have typically been active for less than nine months, but 
their public posting rates regularly rival full\-time groups. TTPs for this 
type of group are more varied than a full\-time group, yet still project 
an organized and determined operational capability. If the rebrand 
wasnt announced publicly, these groups TTPs will help identify their 
previous identity.
Example: Royal
SPLINTER: 
These groups are established and have been active for 2\-5 months 
with varied public posting rates. Their TTPs are varied, sometimes 
borrowed, and indicative of less experienced operators that are 
developing their brand and identity. If their split from another group 
wasnt public information, their TTP overlap with known groups can 
give them away.
Example: Onyx
EPHEMERAL:
These groups have been active for less than two months, with varied, 
but low, victim rates. Many times, these groups are a flash in the pan 
and do not progress to more developed and mature group types.
Example: Sparta
Ransomware Taxonomy
Annual Ransomware Trends
Throughout 2022, victim posting 
rates remained fairly consistent, 
with the biggest lull occurring in late 
June and early July. This lull can 
most likely be attributed to the 
shift from Lockbit 2 to Lockbit 3, 
although challenges in the crypto 
currency market may have also 
had an impact. (More on that 
in a minute)
On average, there were 11\.2 groups 
operating during any week in 2022\. 
Notably, every month in 2022 saw 
at least one new group emerge with 
double extortion capabilities.
March was the most active month of 
2022 with 279 claimed victims, with 
April coming in at 278\. Together 
March and April accounted for 22% 
of the total victims of 2022\.

Rate of Publicly Posted Ransomware 
Victims vs Price of Bitcoin (2022\)
One of the strongest correlations 
that we found when analyzing the 
data for all of 2022 was the link 
between victim posting rates and 
the price of Bitcoin.
Due to the way that groups tend to 
group their victim postings, the 
rate of posting doesnt seem to 
correlate to Bitcoin at first. But 
when we used a 4 period moving 
average to normalize the posting 
rates, the link became clear.
This suggests that threat groups 
closely monitor Bitcoin prices and 
increase operations while Bitcoin 
prices are high to maximize profits. 
Likewise, it suggests that threat 
groups may slow down operations 
while Bitcoin prices are more 
volatile to reduce potential losses.

2022 Correlating Geo\-Political 
and World Events 
The following graph shows the daily rate of victim posting and active groups, overlaid with significant world events that may have influenced 
ransomware activity. Save for September 12, almost all the peaks and valleys for the year correlate to major world events.
 January 7, Eastern Orthodox Christmas Day: January 7, Eastern Orthodox Christmas Day: We observed a two\-week slowdown following 
Orthodox Christmas Day, a commonly observed holiday in Russia.
 Feb 21\-28, Russia Invasion of Ukraine and Conti Leaks: There was a sharpyet short\-liveddecline in ransomware activity following the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Conti leaks.
 March 28, Bitcoin price peaks at $47k: In the weeks leading up to March 28, we observed a rapid increase in ransomware activity that 
peaked as Bitcoin prices skyrocketed to $47k per bitcoin.
 May 16 \- June 6, Conti denounces AlphV and Lockbit, Crypto Market Shrinkage Begins: Ransomware rates begin to fall as competition 
and animosity occurs between ransomware groups and cryptocurrency markets begin to plummet. 
 June 27, Lockbit3 Release: Ransomware rates steadily increase following the official release of Lockbit3\.
 November 14, World Cup Starts: Ransomware activity initially declines during the World Cup, but spikes as the World Cup progresses.

Cumulative Victims by Threat Group
During 2022, Lockbit was responsible 
for the vast majority of ransomware 
victims, and at the end of the year 
accounted for 33% of all publicly 
posted ransomware victims.
Despite entering the double extortion 
game beginning in late April, Blackbasta
still ended 2022 as the 4th most 
impactful ransomware group.
Vice Society began 2022 with a huge 
spike in publicly posted victims, posting 
25 victims on January 6th. However, a 
sharp decrease and low and slow 
approach throughout the remainder of 
the year led them to 6th place overall 
among ransomware groups.
Despite both getting a late start in 
2022, BianLian and Royal ended up 
as the 7th and 8th most impactful 
ransomware groups of 2022, 
respectively.

In 2022, Full\-Time groups accounted for the most activity in 
the most highly impacted industries.
Unsurprisingly, Lockbit was the most impactful Full\-Time 
ransomware group in the top four impacted industries of 2022\. 
Surprisingly, there more healthcare victims targeted by Lockbit
were targeted after the release of Lockbit3 (51%), despite 
Lockbit explicitly calling out healthcare as a sensitive industry 
that should not be touched unless they are "for profit." 
Reviewing Lockbits late 2022 healthcare victims, some 
victims are for\-profit organizations, but others are focused 
on patient health.
Despite receiving less focus by researchers, Hive was the third 
most active group in 2022, which is highlighted by their top 3 
representation in the Technology and Healthcare industries.
Blackbasta is the only non\-Full\-Time group represented in
the top\-impact groups. However, there is strong correlation 
between BlackBastas TTPs and the now\-defunct Conti, so 
their presence as a Rebrand is less surprising in this ranking.
Alongside Vice Societys strong presence in Healthcare 
targeting, they also accounted for more than 13rd of all 
Education victims (48 out of 143\) for the year. Their track 
record across the year has consistently shown their 
willingness to target sensitive industries.

2022 Recap
Threat Actor Activity Breakdown
Rate of Publicly Posted Ransomware Victims (2022\)
Q1 and Q4 were the most active 
quarters of the year, while Q2 and 
Q3 showed less activity.
Full\-Time group activity steadily 
declined as 2022 progressed, which 
may show the potential impacts of 
Contis mid\-year rebrand effort and 
the proliferation of new Rebrand 
groups entering the scene.
Mirroring the decline in Full\-Time 
group activity, Rebrand group 
activity grew steadily as 2022 
progressed, culminating in a large 
surge in Q4\.
Splinter and Ephemeral group 
activity remained consistent 
throughout 2022\.

The average days active in 2022 for each group 
type represents a clear illustration of the 
taxonomies defined by GRIT.
The average operating duration of Splinter 
groups rivaled the average duration of rebrand 
groups. This illustrates the maturation process 
pursued by many groups as they progress from 
Splinter, to rebrand, and potentially full\-time. If 
an Ephemeral group matures into a successful 
splinter group, it is likely that they will mature 
into higher and more consistent group types.
On average, ephemeral groups only operated 
for 21 daysshowing their "flash in the pan" 
natureand contribute to the volatility 
associated with the number of groups 
operating during any given week.

Industry Targeting by Group Type
Manufacturing was by far the most targeted 
industry among Full\-Time ransomware 
group victims. This carries over to both 
Rebrand and Splinter groups, with only 
Ephemeral groups preferring to target the 
Technology sector over Manufacturing.
Following Manufacturing, Full\-Time and 
Rebrand groups targeted Construction and 
Technology victims at near identical rates.
Splinter and Ephemeral groups are more 
likely to target sensitive industries like 
healthcare and education relative to their 
total victimology.
Retail and Wholesale appears in the top 5 
industries for of all group types except 
Ephemeral.
Rebrand is the only group type that 
included Industrial Services in their top 5, 
of which Blackbasta accounted for 55% 
of victims.

Regardless of group type, the United States was the most targeted country.
Full\-Time groups are far more likely to target China with ransomware attacks (23 in 2022 
compared to 4 combined for all other group types).
Full\-time and Rebrand groups have a much more distributed targeting presence in South 
America compared to Splinter and Ephemeral groups, which were both exclusively focused on 
Brazil and Columbia.
Outside of targeting the United States, Full\-Time and Rebrand groups are more likely to focus 
their efforts on western countries while Splinter and Ephemeral groups are much more evenly 
distributed around the world.
All group types show a lack of targeting former Soviet Union countries.
2022 Recap
Major Events and Observations
Major Events and Observations 

In Q1, the industry observed Contis internal struggles stemming from their back and forth support for Russia in 
their conflict with Ukraine. 
o
This ultimately resulted in a massive leak of their playbooks, infrastructure, source code, and more that led to an 
unrecoverable state for the group.
o
Conti disbanded early in 2022 in favor of pursuing operations after a thorough rebranding process into groups such as 
Blackbasta, AlphV, and more.

More ransomware groups are seeing the value of single extortion methodology
o
Lockbit explicitly allows exfiltration of data of all industries, including critical infrastructure
o
More groups are seeing the benefits of leveraging data exfiltration for payment without encryption

Vulnerability exploitation was solidified as one of the most effective methods of achieving initial access into 
victim networks
o
Many critical vulnerabilities were either being exploited in the wild at the time of initial disclosure while other 
vulnerabilities were being weaponized within days of disclosure. 
o
Organizations are hardly, if at all, able to keep up in their normal patching cycles.

ESXi encryption maintained a spot in the hearts of threat actors
o
Even splinter and ephemeral groups are seeing the advantages of targeting ESXi hypervisor servers as a means of 
encrypting key parts of a victims infrastructure simultaneously
o
Groups of all maturities understand the value of hypervisors and are using these to put significant pressure on victim 
organizations to pay ransoms

Relationships with initial access brokers are becoming more apparent with ransomware groups
o
Ransomware groups are seeing the value of initial access brokers and are leveraging their access of personal and 
organization owned devices to improve their operational efficiency and improve ROI

Threat actors are still leveraging many of the same tactics and techniques to compromise victim organizations
o
Open RDP and SSH to the internet remain commonly exploited by threat actors
o
Unpatched and dated vulnerabilities are still being successfully leveraged for initial access

Threat actors continue to demonstrate their flexibility
o
Microsofts change of default Office Macro behavior was a step in the right direction, but ultimately forced a rapid 
change in initial delivery methods for email\-based attacks.

Q4 Ransomware Trends Recap
Q4 Summary
Now that weve taken a deep dive into overall ransomware activity in 2022, we wanted to take a step back and review 
the activity we tracked during Q4 of 2022\.
Q4 saw a rise back to Q1 victim posting rates after a two\-quarter slowdown in publicly observed activity. Lockbit
continued its reign as the most impactful ransomware group, while new groups like Royal entered the double extortion 
realm with a bang. Major players like AlphV, Bian Lian, and Blackbasta maintained their presence in the top ransomware 
groups of the quarter with consistent activity. 
Interestingly, Lockbit publicly upheld their affiliate rules by banning an affiliate for encrypting a childrens hospital in 
Canada, while other groups, like Vice Society, continue to prove that no industry is off limits.
As Q4 ended, we observed ransomware trends continue to hold their place as the most likely and impactful eCrime
threat that all organizations across all industries face.

Rate of Publicly Posted Ransomware Victims
Victim posting rate was consistent 
in early Q4, but shortly after the 
mid\-November start of World Cup in 
Qatar the rate dropped sharply. 
The high number of groups active 
from week 42 through 47 also saw a 
steep drop after the World Cup, but 
the resurgence in mid\-December 
may correlate to a lull in new 
attacks as they negotiated with 
victims, followed by a surge in posts 
when negotiations went south.
However, this pullback was short\-
lived, as we observed a surge in 
mid\-December before returning to 
the average posting rate of Q4\.
Overall, Q4 saw a 15\.5% increase 
in reported victims and a minor 
increase from 27 active groups in 
Q3 to 30\.

In Q3 Manufacturing tied 
with Technology for most 
targeted industry, but in 
Q4 Manufacturing saw an 
aggressive 59% increase in 
public postings. At the same 
time, the Technology vertical 
saw a 9% decrease in publicly 
posted victims, widening the 
gap even further.
As noted in our last quarterly 
report, there is often very little 
change in the industries that 
make up the top 10 most 
targeted. However, in Q3 legal 
made a surge into the rankings 
and held a spot there through 
November, but was bumped 
from the list by the end of Q4\.

Similar to Q3, ransomware attacks 
targeted mostly western countries in Q4\.
Among the top 10, only India, Taiwan, 
and Australia were outside Europe and 
the Americas.
There was a 32% increase in victim 
posts in the US. Compared to Q3, India 
saw a 100% increase in the number of 
posted victims, bringing them into the 
top 10\.
New victim countries (countries that 
have not been seen in reports since 
GRIT began tracking) for the quarter 
included Monaco, Gambia, Greenland, 
Gibraltar, and Vanyuatu.
Cumulative Victims by Threat Group
LockBit continues to be the most prolific 
ransomware group in Q4, despite a slowdown in 
victim posting. They hit a daily high of 18 victim 
posts in October, which makes it their third highest 
posting day in all of 2022\. Compared to Q3, LockBit
made a significant shift away from targeting in the 
legal industry this quarter.
We observed a a 57% increase in AlphVs reported 
victims in Q4\. Alongside this increase, 34% of their 
annual Manufacturing and Technology victims were 
posted this quarter. 
Royals leak site went live at the beginning of Q4 in 
October, and by the end of the year had already 
claimed 63 victims. Despite their recent emergence, 
the group tied for the most targeting of the Food and 
Beverage industry in Q4\. Even with that focus, their 
victims span 24 industries across 14 countries.

2023 Predictions
2023 Predictions
First, we believe 2023 will continue to see an increase in 
ransomware rebranding.

GRITs 2022 threat actor trends show an increase in 
rebrand, splinter, and ephemeral groups share of total 
victims as 2022 progressed

There has been at least one new group for every month 
of 2022, this will likely continue throughout 2023
Second, vulnerabilities will continue to be heavily researched 
and utilized for initial intrusion into networks.

The time to weaponization of these vulnerabilities is 
likely to decrease as 2023 progresses
Third, as organizations rely on the fundamentals of security to 
establish effective security programs and make the threat actors' 
lives harder, ransomware groups will likely move to single extortion 
attempts based on exfiltration of data where no encryption event 
occurs. We believe this will be especially true for critical 
infrastructure and sensitive industries.
Fourth, and this will aid in our second prediction, emerging 
technologies like ChatGPT, OpenAI, and others will be leveraged to 
automate social engineering and other initial intrusion capabilities.
Finally, as multifactor authentication and zero trust architecture 
continue to be adopted, personal devices will likely be targeted to 
establish initial intrusions into business networks.

Info stealers such as redline stealer, raccoon stealer, etc. will 
continue to be an extremely viable resource for threat actors to 
leverage as an initial intrusion vector.
2022 Wrap Up
After years of ransomware activity, it seems safe to say that ransomware is here to stay, for quite awhile at least. Ransomware groups are 
claiming victims at a staggering rate and new ransomware groups are formed, and sometimes disbanded, on a monthly basis. At the end of the 
day, the ransomware problem is still very real. 
GRITs goal with this research is to educate cybersecurity professionals and leadership, and to encourage security researchers to continue to 
work together to further our defensive and threat intelligence capabilities. If we continue to share intelligence and establish open and 
dynamic methods of communication, its possible that we can start to keep up with the ransomware threat. Through collaboration, we can 
start to be flexible and adaptable, just like our adversaries.
Ransomware groups will continue to target us on a regular basis and leverage any means necessary to accomplish their goals, but that doesnt 
mean its all doom and gloom moving forward. Through well\-established cybersecurity foundations we can start to limit the risk associated 
with unpatched vulnerabilities and lack of visibility. We can focus on ensuring coverage with our security tools and that our analysts and 
leadership are well equipped to handle potential incidents as they arise. Admittedly, this is a large task for almost any team, but, if we focus 
on small wins, and we maintain forward progress, we will make it exponentially more difficult for ransomware groups to be successful. 
GRIT has already begun researching ransomware trends in 2023 and we plan to continue to extend our research capabilities to give granular 
and informative insights into ransomware groups. Through our continued research we hope to disrupt ransomware groups by arming 
cybersecurity professionals with knowledge and intelligence. 
So, heres to 2023 and another successful year of intelligence sharing. Happy hunting!
