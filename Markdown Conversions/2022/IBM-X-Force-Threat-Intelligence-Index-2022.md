shifts to work\-from\-home and back\-to\-office, and
geopolitical changes spawning a constant drone of
mistrust. All of this equates to chaos, and it is in chaos
that cybercriminals thrive. In 2021, IBM Security X\-Force
saw how threat actors opportunistically used a shifting 
landscape to adopt tactics and techniques to successfully 
infiltrate organizations across the globe.The IBM Security X\-Force Threat Intelligence Index maps new trends and attack 
patterns we observed and analyzed from our datadrawing from billions of datapointsranging from network and endpoint detection devices, incident response (IR)engagements, domain name tracking and more. This report represents the culminationof that research based on data collected from January to December 2021\.We offer these findings as a resource to IBM clients, researchers in the security industry,policy makers, the media and to the broader community of security professionals andbusiness leaders.Given the volatile landscape and the evolution of both threat types and threat vectors,you need threat intelligence insights to stay ahead of attackers and fortify your criticalassets more than ever.IBM Security3
3IBM SecurityReport highlightsTop attack type: Ransomware was again the top attack type in 2021, although the 
percentage of attacks X\-Force remediated that were ransomware decreased nearly 9%year\-over\-year. REvila ransomware type X\-Force also refers to as Sodinokibiwasthe most common ransomware strain X\-Force observed for a second year, making up37% of all ransomware attacks, followed by Ryuk at 13%. Law enforcement activity hasprobably been the primary force driving down ransomware and IoT botnet attacks in2021, but this does not preclude a potential resurgence in 2022\.Supply chain vulnerabilities: Supply chain security was pushed to the forefront of 
government and policymakers attention, with the Biden administrations executiveorder on cybersecurity, and guidance from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,CISA, and NIST doubling down on zero trust guidance. These guidelines put a spotlighton vulnerabilities and trusted relationships. Vulnerability exploitation was the top initialattack vector in manufacturing, an industry grappling with the effects of supply chainpressures and delays.Most phished brands: X\-Force closely tracked how cybercriminals are using phishing 
kits throughout 2021, and our research revealed that Microsoft, Apple and Google werethe top three brands criminals attempted to mimic. These mega brands were usedrepeatedly in phishing kits, with attackers likely seeking to capitalize on their popularityand the trust many consumers place in them.Top threat groups: Suspected Iranian nation\-state threat actor ITG17 (MuddyWater), 
cybercriminal group ITG23 (Trickbot), and Hive0109 (LemonDuck) were some of themost active threat groups X\-Force intelligence analysts observed in 2021\. Threat groupsworldwide were seeking to augment their prowess and infiltrate more organizations.Malware they used was embedded with greater defense\-evasion techniques, in somecases hosted via cloud\-based messaging and storage platforms to get through securitycontrols. These platforms were abused to hide command and control communicationin legitimate network traffic. Threat actors also continued to develop Linux versions ofmalware, to enable them to cross over to cloud environments more easily.4IBM SecurityExecutive summaryKey stats21%Ransomware share of attacks
Ransomware was the number one attack type observed by X\-Force last year,decreasing to 21% of attacks from 23% in the previous year. REvil ransomwareactors (aka Sodinokibi) were responsible for 37% of all ransomware attacks.17 monthsAverage time before a ransomware gang rebrands or shuts down
Ransomware gangs studied by X\-Force had an average lifespan of 17 monthsbefore rebranding or disbanding. REvil, one of the most successful gangs, shutdown in October 2021 after 31 months (two and a half years).41%Percentage of attacks exploiting phishing for initial access 
Phishing operations emerged as the top pathway to compromise in 2021, with41% of incidents X\-Force remediated using this technique to gain initial access.33%Increase in the number of incidents caused byvulnerability exploitations from 2020 to 2021
Four out of the top five vulnerabilities exploited in 2021 were new vulnerabilities,including the Log4j vulnerability CVE\-2021\-44228which was ranked numbertwo, despite only being disclosed in December.3XClick effectiveness for targeted phishing campaigns that add phone calls 
The click rate for the average targeted phishing campaign was 17\.8%, but targetedphishing campaigns that added phone calls (vishing or voice phishing) were threetimes more effective, netting a click from 53\.2% of victims.5IBM SecurityExecutive summary146%Increase in Linux ransomware with new code
The percentage of Linux ransomware with unique (new) code increasedyear\-over\-year by 146%, according to Intezer, indicating an increase in thelevel of Linux ransomware innovation1Manufacturing industry rank for attacks 
Manufacturing replaced financial services as the top attacked industry in 2021,representing 23\.2% of the attacks X\-Force remediated last year. Ransomware wasthe top attack type, accounting for 23% of attacks on manufacturing companies.61%Manufacturing share of compromises on OT\-connected organizations
Sixty\-one percent of incidents at OT\-connected organizations last year werein the manufacturing industry. In addition, 36% of attacks on OT\-connectedorganizations were ransomware.2,204%Increase in reconnaissance against OT

Twenty\-six percent of all attacks had targets in Asia in their crosshairs.Asia was the most attacked geography of 2021\.6IBM SecurityExecutive summaryTop attack typesFor the purposes of this report, we categorize attack 
types by the end goal an attacker is seeking to 
achieve once they have gained access to a victims 
network. Attack types differ from initial infection 
vectors, with the latter being the initial method of 
entry into a network.As examples, some attack types include ransomware, data theft, andBEC, based on the end goal of the threat actors operation. Examples ofinitial infection vectors include phishing, using stolen credentials, andvulnerability exploitation.The following sections provide details and data on the most prolificattack types our data revealed in 2021\.Ransomware
For more than three years, ransomware has been the top attack typeobserved by X\-Force, and 2021 was no exception. Twenty\-one percentof attacks remediated by X\-Force incident response in 2021 wereransomware attacks. This is down slightly from the year prior, when 23%of attacks X\-Force remediated were ransomware attacks; however, thevolume of ransomware attacks has remained steady year\-over\-year.IBM Security7

actors have continued 
operations under
new namesAccording to X\-Force research, 17 months is the averagetime before a ransomware group either rebrands or shutsdown, with a median of 18 months. Ransomware groupsoften spring up and rebrand once there is a threat ofarrest or action by law enforcement. In some cases, lawenforcement action forces ransomware groups to shutdown entirely. Despite this dynamic environmentorperhaps because of itmany ransomware actors remainat large, and X\-Force assesses that criminal ransomwareactivity will continue into the foreseeable future, basedon the high profits generated by this activity and currentlimitations on law enforcement for widely shuttingdown ransomware activity. X\-Force is aware of manyransomware actors that have rebranded and continuedoperations under new names, with GandCrab to REvil,Maze to Egregor, and DoppelPaymer to Grief as examples.Law enforcement activity is probably the primary factordriving down the percentage of ransomware attacksX\-Force observed in 2021, but it is very likely that thegroups we have seen disappear will rebrand and re\-emerge in 2022 under new names and that ransomwareactivity will continue.IBM Security10

Given the deep experience X\-Force Incident Response (X\-Force IR) has in remediatingransomware attacks, our team has observed a recent pattern emerge across the vast 
majority of ransomware attacks. In particular, we have been able to develop a five\-stagemodel that defines the common pattern observed in most ransomware incidents.12IBM SecurityTop attack typesFigure 5

The most common access vectors forransomware attacks continue to bephishing, vulnerability exploitation,and remote services such as remotedesktop protocol.Stage 2: Post exploitation
Depending on the initial access vector,the second stage may involve anintermediary remote access tool (RAT)or malware prior to establishing interactiveaccess with an offensive security tool suchas Cobalt Strike or Metasploit.Stage 3: Understand and expand
During the third stage of the attack,attackers have consistently focusedon understanding the local system anddomain that they currently have accessto and acquiring additional credentialsto enable lateral movement.Stage 4: Data collection and exfiltration
Almost every ransomware incident X\-ForceIR has responded to since 2019 hasinvolved the double extortion tactic ofdata theft and ransomware. During stage 4of the attack, the focus of the ransomwareoperators switched primarily to identifyingvaluable data and exfiltrating it.Stage 5: Ransomware deployment
In almost every single ransomwareincident X\-Force IR has responded to, theransomware operators targeted a domaincontroller as the distribution point for theransomware payload.13IBM SecurityTop attack typesA concerning new trend in ransomware has been the expansion of triple extortiontactics. In this type of attack, threat actors encrypt and steal data and also threatento engage in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against the affectedorganization. This kind of attack is particularly problematic for organizationsbecause victims have their networks held hostage with two kinds of maliciousattacksoften simultaneouslyand are then further victimized by the theft (andoften leak) of data.11%of attacks were
server accessRansomware gangs are beginning to look to their primary victims extendedbusiness partners to pressure them into paying a ransom to prevent their owndata leakages or business disruptions caused by the ransomware attack.Server access
Server access attackswhere the attacker gained unauthorized access to a server,but the final end goal is unknownwas the second\-most common attack type,making up 11% of all incidents X\-Force IR team remediated in 2021\.The majority of these attacks occurred in Asia, and in many cases the threat actorswere successful in deploying malware or employing penetration testing tools ona server, including China Chopper Webshells, Black Orifice malware, Printspoofer,and Mimikatz.In some instances, the threat actors exploited a known vulnerability, such asCVE\-2020\-7961, which would allow for remote code execution on a server.In multiple cases threat actors exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchangeservers to gain unauthorized access to networks of interest. These vulnerabilitiesare included in the top 10 vulnerabilities of 2021 listed below.Some of the server access attacks observed by X\-Forces IR team may havebeen failed attempts to steal data or deploy ransomware. Thus, while companiesaim to prevent attackers from gaining any level of unauthorized access to theirnetworks, its likely that a high number of server access attacks indicates thatorganizations are identifying and eradicating attacks before they progress intomore damaging operations.14IBM SecurityTop attack typesBusiness email compromise
After a downturn in business email compromise (BEC) attacks in 2020, X\-Force observeda decrease in this attack type again in 2021\. BEC was the third\-most common attacktype remediated by our X\-Force IR team. Last year, we theorized that widespreadimplementation of multifactor authentication (MFA) was decreasing the number ofsuccessful attacks BEC threat actors were able to execute. That theory held in 2021,since BEC attackers may have realized greater success by shifting focus to geographies

where MFA is not as widely implemented.

attacks the X\-Force IR team is remediating. North American organizations were stillstrongly in the crosshairs of BEC operations, but the surge we noticed against LatinAmerican organizations suggests that BEC attackers shifted the geographic focus of theiroperations: zero percent of attacks against Latin American organizations were BEC in2019, but 19% of attacks were BEC in 2020 and 20% of attacks in 2021 were BEC.Figure 6

For targeted phishing campaigns in 2020 and 2021, the average click rate foran X\-Force Red simulated campaign was 17\.8%. When vishing (voice phishing) phone calls were addedto the campaign, the click rate rose to 53\.2%, three times as effective.BEC attackers have leveraged phishing campaigns and social engineering with great success.And particularly in 2021, X\-Force observed ransomware actors rely even more heavily on phishingcampaigns to gain initial access to victim networks for ransomware attacks.17IBM SecurityTop infection vectors 
For example, multiple REvil ransomware incidents observed in 2021 began with a QakBot phishingemail. These emails usually have very short messages, often refer to unpaid invoices, and occasionallywill even hijack ongoing email conversations and reply all with only a malicious attachment.When opened, the document will instruct the recipient to enable macros which will drop the QakBotbanking trojan, gaining an initial foothold on a system. The operation is then transferred to REvilransomware actors who conduct reconnaissance and proceed with the operation from there.A sample QakBot phishing email is included in figure 9\.Figure 9

Example of QakBot phishing email with malicious attachment (Source: IBM Security X\-Force)18IBM SecurityTop infection vectorsWhen the recipient attempts to open the attachment, they are prompted by a popup(see figure 10\) to enable macros by choosing Enable editing and Enable content.This allows the threat actor to deploy malware on the victims machine with theassistance of malicious macros.Figure 10

abuse technology and bank brands
IBM analyzed thousands of phishing kits from around the world to determine thefrequency and effectiveness of this particular attack vector. Our investigation suggeststhat malicious actors who use phishing kits probably put in tedious hours with limitedgains. In particular, our investigation showed that:Phishing kit deployments generally had a short lifespan, with almost one\-third ofdeployed kits being used for no longer than a day. In some cases, an individualdeployment of a phishing kit lasted only seven\-to\-eight hours before most hostingproviders identified the site as malicious and blocked it.Each deployment on average had no greater than 75 potential victims who visitedthe site.Phishing kits asked for user credentials (emailIDpassword combinations) in nearlyevery kit observed (close to 100%), followed in popularity by credit card data (61% 
of requests), mailing address (40%), phone number (22%), date of birth (17%),identity card number (15%), security questions (14%), and ATM PINs (3%).19IBM SecurityTop infection vectorsIn addition, X\-Force looked at which brands were most frequentlyspoofed in phishing kits. The top brands included large technologycompanies and large financial institutions. The top 11 brands arelisted below.222,127phishing attacks inJune 2021, setting anall\-time record highTop 11 most spoofed brands of 20211\.Microsoft2\.Apple3\.Google4\.BMO Harris Bank (BMO)

Monitoring for suspicious connections to likely spoofedbrands can help organizations minimize the probability of impact fromthis attack vector.Using a DNS service thats dedicated to data privacy, like Quad92, can 
also help mitigate the risk of phishing attacks.2 IBM Security X\-Force is a Quad9 partner.20IBM SecurityTop infection vectorsVulnerability exploitation
Despite dropping to the second\-most common in 2021, the number of incidentsthat were caused by vulnerability exploitation this past year rose 33% from 2020,indicating this attack vectors strong hold in threat actors arsenals. This vectorallows threat actors to gain access to victim networks for further operationsin many cases with elevated privileges.X\-Force observed actors leveraging multiple known vulnerabilities, such asCVE\-2021\-35464 (a Java deserialization vulnerability) and CVE\-2019\-19781(a Citrix path traversal flaw), to gain initial access to networks of interest. In addition,we observed threat actors leverage zero\-day vulnerabilities in major attacks likethe Kaseya ransomware attack and Microsoft Exchange Server incidents to accessvictim networks and devices.Near the end of 2021, widespread exploitation of the Log4j vulnerabilityCVE\-2021\-44228 also launched this vulnerability into second place in X\-Forcestop 10 list for 2021\. Several mitigation measures can assist your organizationin avoiding becoming a victim of this vulnerability.IBM Security21

Even more concerning is that the number of exploitstools threat actors canuse to exploit a vulnerabilityare also rising steadily, creating an ever\-expanding arrayof options for threat actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities.Vulnerabilities related to Internet of Things (IoT) and industrial control systems (ICS)increased at an even faster rate than overall vulnerabilities, with these two categories

23IBM SecurityTop infection vectorsThreats to operational technology and Internet of ThingsKnown vulnerabilities related to industrial control systems (ICS) 
and, by extension, operational technology (OT)as well as Internet
of Things (IoT) vulnerabilities are increasing each year, with an 
appreciable increase in identified vulnerabilities from 2020 to 2021\.As more things come alive with the power of digitization and internet protocols, so do newvulnerabilities and risks. While many of these issues affect only industrial organizations, anyorganization that uses IoT in its infrastructure is also increasingly exposed to risk.In addition to this increased digitization, the dynamics of supply chains are affecting the attacksurface for many OT\-connected organizations. Threat actors understand the critical role manufacturingand energy play in global supply chains and are seeking to disrupt these organizations because of theripple effect it can have across multiple industries and the pressure these multiplying effects createFigure 12

Analyzing data from 2021, X\-Force observed attackersconducting massive reconnaissance campaignssearching for exploitable communications in industrialnetworks. Specifically, 2021 saw a considerable increasein reconnaissance activity targeting TCP port 502\.This port uses Modbus, an application layer messagingprotocol used to provide client\-to\-server communicationbetween connected buses, networks, and programmablelogic controller (PLC) devices in industrial networks.Port 502 is commonly used by supervisory control anddata acquisition (SCADA). Access to Modbus could allowthreat actors to control physical devices connected tothe internet.Between January and September of 2021,X\-Force observed a 2204% increase in adversarialreconnaissance activity targeting port 502\.Figure 12

Threat actors may have heightened Modbus reconnaissance to begin finding targets toransom or seize control and cause harm. Given Modbuss lack of security features, once anattacker has found an accessible Modbus device, they could then issue harmful commandsto the device and impact connected ICS or IoT systems.Although SCADA Modbus resides in Level 2 of the Purdue Model within ICS environmentswhich ideally should be segmented from the enterprise network and placed behind ademilitarized zonein some cases the SCADA Modbus port 502 can be accessed directlyover the open internet. Lack of authentication and transmission of messages in plain textare some additional aspects of Modbus that make it less secure when compared to other,more modern technologies.Manufacturing most targeted of OT industries, 
ransomware leads
In terms of industries with OT networks, X\-Force observed manufacturing was the mostattacked in 2021 by a significant margin, victimized in 61% of incidents X\-Force assistedin remediating. Ransomware actors in particular find manufacturing to be an attractivetarget, likely due to these organizations low tolerance for down time.IBM Security25

Post\-infection, it is capable of maintainingpersistence on network gateways, which can be particularly effective initial access points for lateralmovement to high\-value networks, including OT and ICS networks. In addition, by infecting routers,threat actors behind Mozi can position themselves to conduct man\-in\-the\-middle attacks that lead toransomware deployment, including attacks on OT networks.In addition to Mozis access and lateral movement capabilities, a large Mozi botnet that infects a largenumber of security cameras or similar IoT devices at an organization can diminish an organizations 
ability to effectively conduct physical security operations.Chinese law enforcement reportedly arrested the authors of the Mozi botnet in June and August 2021,and the decrease in IoT attack volume in Q4 2021 is probably a side\-effect of these arrests.28IBM SecurityThreats to operational technology and Internet of ThingsTop threat actors of 2021Our 2021 IR data show that where a threat actor could be 
identified, cybercriminals were the leading source of attacks.Nation\-state actors made up only 2% of the engagements X\-Force remediated in 2021,underscoring the high volume of activity generated by cybercriminal activity. The nation\-state actors we observed were largely seeking to conduct espionage and surveillance,and in some cases, may have been laying the groundwork for future sabotage. Only 1%of the activity we observed was from hacktivist groups.Figure 16

uses Aclip backdoor
In 2021, IBM Security X\-Force observed a threat actor using a new backdoor thatX\-Force named Aclip. In addition, the adversary leveraged a legitimate messaging andcollaboration application tool likely to obfuscate operational communications, allowingmalicious traffic, or traffic with underlying malicious intent, to go unnoticed. Based onthe tools, tactics, and infrastructure observed, we assess with moderate confidence that 
the threat actor we track as ITG173 (aka MuddyWater), a suspected Iranian nation\-state 
group, was behind this activity for the possible purpose of surveillance.ITG23Trickbot Gangenables
Conti ransomware operations
X\-Force analysts have been closely tracking the cybercriminal group behind the Trickbotbanking trojana group we identify as ITG23, also known as Wizard Spider or TrickbotGang. Phishing emails with the Trickbot trojan are often used as an entry point forConti ransomware, and X\-Force has observed that an uptick in ITG23 Trickbot activitycoincided with an uptick in Conti ransomware attacks.The group has relied on email campaigns delivering malicious Excel documents, as wellas the notable BazarCall campaign, in which subscription themed emails encouragerecipients to contact a fraudulent call center where the telephone operator then guidesthe user to download the BazarLoader malware, under the guise of unsubscribing from aservice. Additionally, the group has more recently been hijacking email threads and willthen reply all with malicious attachments.Hive0109 active in 2021
X\-Force observed multiple Hive0109also known as LemonDuckcompromises in2021, and the group has proven itself adept at leveraging the ProxyLogon vulnerabilitiesto compromise unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers. LemonDuck targets both Linuxand Windows systems and is known to capitalize on news\-worthy events for phishinglures in its campaigns.LemonDuck is persistent malware that was primarily used to mine cryptocurrency.It has likely been active at least since 2018 and has since evolved into a large botnet.LemonDuck propagates quickly and acts as a first\-stage loader for subsequent malwareand attacks. It continues to mine for crypto coins on infected devices.3ITG stands for IBM Threat Group. This is IBM X\-Forces naming convention for threat actor groupsboth nation\-state and cybercriminal. IBM tracks and names threat groups numerically, identified by
IBM Threat Group (ITG) followed by an assigned number. For threat groups still in the research phase, 
we use the designation Hive, as in Hive0109 discussed in this section.30IBM SecurityTop threat actors of 2021Trends in malware developmentThreat actors continue to innovate and find new ways to make 
malware more capable across operating systems and more 
challenging to detect. This section describes some of the 
trends in malware development X\-Force observed in 2021\.Next\-level detection evasion 
X\-Forces malware reverse\-engineering team uncovered over the last year significantupgrades in malware evasion techniques.Ransomware authors were employing different encryption techniques to avoid host\-based detection systems. One example is intermittent encryption, where separated 
blocks of data are encrypted rather than the entire system, which speeds theencryption process.Command and control (C2\) communications were increasingly using popular cloudmessaging and storage services to blend into legitimate traffic. Additionally, the useof DNS for tunneling C2 communications was also becoming more prevalent.These techniques help attackers mask C2 activity from network\-based sensorsby posing as legitimate communications.Malware authors were utilizing increasingly sophisticated packing and codeobfuscation techniques to hide the true purpose of the malware and hinder analysisattempts. Malware developers also experimented with different programminglanguages such as PureBasic and Nim to decrease the ease of reverse engineering.Malware focus on Docker 
Analyzing malware trends impacting cloud environments, X\-Force IR observed multiplemalware families shifting their sights from targeting generic Linux systems to focusingon Docker containers, often used in platform\-as\-a\-service cloud solutions.Some malware families illustrating this shift include XorDDoS, Groundhog and Tsunami.This Docker\-focused push expands beyond just bots, also highlighting the maliciousactivity of IoT malware (Kaiji), cryptominers (Xanthe, Kinsing) and other malware strainsthat aim to leverage the power of cloud computing to scale their mining power.Threat actors have also been observed targeting other container platforms in additionto Docker. For example, the Siloscape malware was found compromising vulnerable 
Windows containers and the Kubernetes container management platform. Siloscape isincreasingly incorporated into attacks by actors such as TeamTNT, a cybercrime gangthats been focusing on cloud platforms to expand the reach of its cryptojacking botnets.31IBM SecurityRansomware focus on ESXi
Analyzing malware trends impacting Linux environments, X\-Force observed multipleransomware families shifting their sights to target Linux\-based VMWare ESXi servers.As more organizations increasingly rely on virtualization, ransomware authors arediscovering that it can be more effective to encrypt the virtual machine (VM) filesthemselves, rather than infecting the operating systems running within them.In 2020, X\-Force IR observed a Linux variant of the SFile ransomware deployed againstan ESXi server, and in 2021 a number of other ransomware families appeared to followsuit, including REvil, HelloKitty, Babuk, and BlackMatter. These variants will often makeuse of ESXis own command line management tool esxcli to enumerate and shut downrunning VMs before encrypting them.Nim is in
In 2020, cross\-platform malware developers gravitated to Golang as a programminglanguage of choice, since it could be compiled for multiple operating systems at once.While Golang is still in use in 2021, additional languages such as Nim are becomingmore popular. For example, threat actors used Nim to compile the Nimar backdooras well as a version of Zebrocya malware type used by Russian nation\-state actorITG05 (aka APT28\).IBM Security32
32IBM SecurityTrends in malware developmentLinux threats
continue to evolve
Analysis by IBM Security X\-Force ThreatIntelligence partner Intezer found thatover the last year, malware targeting Linuxenvironments dramatically increased,indicating continued threat actor interestin this space.Intezer analyzes code uniqueness ofmalware strains to measure innovation. 
Malware code with more unique variationsindicates more innovation has been usedto edit the malware, whereas malware withmostly recycled code has less innovation.Using this methodology, the followingresults were reported.Linux malware saw unique code increasein four out of five categories since theprevious year, with the greatest increasebeing observed in banking trojans, whichsaw innovation increase over tenfold.This increase in Linux targeting may beRansomwarecorrelated to organizations increasinglymoving into cloud environments, whichfrequently rely on Linux for their operation.The level of innovation of Linux malwarecame close to that of Windows\-basedmalware, highlighting just how prevalentLinux malware innovation has become,a trend that we are sure to see increasingin 2022 as well.BankerTrojanMinerBotnetFigure 17Linux malware with unique code, 2021 vs. 2020

IBM research into the cloud security threat landscape highlighted threat actorscontinued efforts to shift targeting into cloud environments. Data gathered showedthat threat actors used a variety of methods to gain initial access into organizationscloud assets, with nearly a quarter of incidents stemming from threat actors pivotinginto the cloud from on\-premise networks. In addition, API misconfiguration issueswere involved in nearly two\-thirds of studied incidents. This targeting coincidedwith a robust underground marketplace for cloud\-related credentials, with tens ofthousands of accounts for sale online.As organizations move into the cloud, threat actors are following right alongside.Maintaining properly hardened systems, enacting effective password policies, andensuring policy compliance is critical to maintaining a robust cloud security posture.Fileless malware in the cloud
Evasive, fileless malware lurking in memory can elude standard detection tools byexploiting legitimate scripting languages and sidestepping the use of signatures.X\-Force research has found that, besides using scripts to launch fileless malware,threat actors are now using Ezuri, an opensource crypter and memory loader writtenin Golang, which makes it even easier to launch undetected malware.X\-Force research has also highlighted the development of a new malware suite dubbedVermillionStrike. VermillionStrike is based on the popular penetration testing toolCobaltStrike; however, unlike its counterpart, VermillionStrike is designed to run onLinux systems. This development highlights the continued migration to malwaretargeting Linux, and likely indicates ongoing operations outside of Windowsenvironments will continue into the future.34IBM SecurityTrends in malware developmentGeographic trendsFor the first time since this report began 
documenting geographic trends, Asia has moved 
into first place as the most\-attacked region in 2021, 
receiving 26% of attacks X\-Force observed last year. 
A flurry of attacks on Japan in particularpotentially 
related to the Summer Olympic Games held in 
Japan in 2021appear to have contributed to this 
attack trend.Europe and North America followed closely behind, garnering 24% and

North AmericaFor the purposes of reporting, IBM considers North America to include theUnited States and Canada.North America emerged as the third\-most attacked region inthe world in 2021, receiving 23% of the attacks X\-Force incidentresponse team observed. Similar to Europe, ransomware ledas the top attack type on North American organizations, makingup 30% of all attacks in this region. Its possible that the increasedlaw enforcement activity in 2021, including the takedown of botnetsand ransomware groups, are beginning to impede the attack ratewe traditionally observed in the region.REvil attacks made up 43% of the ransomware attacksX\-Force observed in North America, and X\-Force also observedLockBit 2\.0, Conti, CryptoLocker and Eking. After ransomware,BEC was the second\-most common attack type in North America,making up 12% of attacks and suggesting that BEC attackershave renewed their assault on North American organizations,seeking to compromise organizations that do not have MFAdeployed. Server access attacks (9%) came in third placefor North American organizations.Phishing appears to be the attack vector of choice for threat actorstargeting North America, observed in 47% of the incidents X\-Forceremediated in this region in 2021\.

Use of stolencredentials and phishing were also frequently used togain access to Middle East and Africa networks of interest,and password spraying and use of removable media wereoccasionally used to gain initial access as well.Finance and insurance organizations made up theoverwhelming majority of targets in the Middle Eastand Africa in 2021, accounting for 48% of allattacks, signaling a potential shift from nation\-statesponsored energy\-focused attacks in the region tocybercriminal attacks focused on financial organizations.Saudi Arabias shift to diversify its economy away fromcrude revenues may also be impacting this trend.Healthcare organizations made up another 15% ofattacks in the region, and energy organizations wereassociated with 10% of attacks in the region.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and South Africawere the most\-attacked countries in the Middle East andAfrica region.Top attacked industries1\.Finance and insurance2\.Healthcare3\.Energy48%15%10%40IBM SecurityGeographic trendsTop attacked industries1\.Manufacturing2\.Retail and wholesale3\.Finance and insurance22%20%15%Latin AmericaFor the purposes of reporting, IBM considers Latin America to include Mexico,Central America and South America.The top attack type for Latin America in 2021 was ransomware,making up 29% of attacks, followed by BEC (21%) and credentialharvesting (21%), tying for second place. REvil was the mostcommon ransomware strain observed in Latin America, making up50% of ransomware attacks X\-Force remediated, with Ryuk andAtomSilo also being observed targeting organizations in the region.As discussed previously in this document, the rate of BEC attacksagainst Latin America is higher than for any other geography, andrepresents a sharp increase since 2019, suggesting that BECattackers are focusing greater attention on Latin American targets.Phishing was the most common infection vector threat actorsused against Latin American targets, making up 47% of attacksX\-Force remediated in this region. The high number of BEC attacksand ransomware attacks delivered via phishing is probably drivingthis trend. Stolen credentials led to 29% of attacks on LatinAmerican organizations, and this high percentage comparedto other regions suggests that more widespread use of MFAcould help to drive down stolen credential and BEC incidents inthis region. Vulnerability exploitation led to only 18% of incidentsat Latin American organizations while removable media accountedfor another 6%.Manufacturing was the most\-targeted industry in Latin Americain 2021, but at 22% led by only a small margin. Retail andwholesale (20%), finance and insurance (15%), and perhapsmost surprisingly, mining (11%) followed closely behind.Professional and business services and energy were alsofairly heavily attacked in Latin America. Ransomware attackersand BEC attackers appear to be interested in targeting theseindustries, probably driving the attack rate for these industriesin Latin America.Brazil, Mexico and Peru were the most\-attacked countries in
Latin America.41IBM SecurityGeographic trendsIndustry trendsFor the first time in over five years of this report, finance and insurance was 
not the top\-attacked industry in 2021, as manufacturing overtook it by a slight 
margin. The onslaught of ransomware and BEC attacks targeting manufacturing 
organizationscompounding supply chain pressure created by the COVID\-19 
pandemicpossibly contributed to this shift.In addition to finance and manufacturing, professional and business services was heavily targeted in 2021,particularly by ransomware actors. This year, we are combining professional and business services as wellas retail and wholesale to provide a broader picture of the industry attack landscape. It is worth noting thatwholesale was much more heavily attacked than retail last year, with wholesale largely driving the ranking for

Server access attacks came in second place at12%, representing probably some failed attacker operations. BEC and data thefttied for third place, at 10% each. BEC attackers are probably seeking to capitalizeon the many supplier, sub\-supplier, and wholesale shipping relationshipsmanufacturing organizations develop, and attempt to redirect payments betweenpartners to accounts under the BEC attackers control. Data theft probably aims atstealing sensitive intellectual property or holding data for ransom.Vulnerability exploitation was the top infection vector at manufacturingorganizations in 2021, at 47%, followed closely by phishing at 40%. The volumeof these attacks probably drove the overall initial infection vector trends X\-Forceobserved in 2021\. Removable media (7%), stolen credentials (3%) and brute force(3%) also accounted for a small percentage of attacks. Although vulnerabilityexploitation came out on top, manufacturing organizations will probably want todevote an equal amount of effort to combating phishing threats, in addition tovulnerability management.Nearly one\-third, or 32% of attacks on manufacturing organizations occurredin Asia in 2021, with North America (27%) and Europe (26%) seeing similarpercentages of attacks.

52IBM SecurityIndustry trendsRisk mitigation recommendationsThe threats we have presented in this report have the 
potential to cause concern, as the report underscores the 
grave and increasing threat from ransomware, renewed 
threats from BEC and phishing, and highlights several 
zero\-day exploits threat actors have exploited over the 
past year. However, our intention is for this information 
to empower organizations as they better understand the 
current threat landscape, and help build confidence in the 
actions they need to take to combat these threats.Some security principles X\-Force has found helpful in combating todays cyberthreats include a zero trust approach, automation of incident response, andextended detection and response capabilities.Zero trust assists in decreasing risk
of top attacks
Zero trust is a paradigm shift, a new way of approaching security problems, thatassumes a breach has already happened and aims to increase the difficulty for anattacker to move throughout a network. At its core is understanding where criticaldata resides and who has access to this data, and creating robust verificationmeasures throughout a network to ensure only the right individuals are accessingthat data in the right way.Research by X\-Force threat researchers confirms that principles related to azero trust approachto include implementation of MFA and the principle of leastprivilegehave the potential to decrease organizations susceptibility to the topattack types identified in this report, particularly ransomware and BEC.Applying the principle of least privilege to domain controllers and domainadministrator accounts in particular can increase barriers for ransomwareactors, as many of these actors seek to deploy ransomware to a network from acompromised domain controller. In addition, implementing MFA increases thedifficulty for cybercriminals seeking to take over email accounts by requiring thatthey provide further authentication beyond stolen credentials.Learn more about 
how to build a zero 
trust approach53IBM SecuritySecurity automation enhances
incident response
The X\-Force incident response team addresses hundreds of incidents every year,in a variety of geographies, assisting in\-house incident response analysts andaddressing a range of attack types. Speed is of the essence, whether that meansidentifying and eradicating threat actors before they can deploy ransomwareon a network, or quickly and efficiently resolving issues to create bandwidth forthe next incident. In this fast\-paced environment, security automation is keyoutsourcing to machines tasks that might take a human analyst or team hours, andidentifying mechanisms for improving workflows.In mid\-2021, IBM donated a threat hunting automation tool to the OpenCybersecurity Alliance, aimed at assisting security operations center (SOC)analysts to quickly conduct forensic investigations and address cyber incidents.In addition, the X\-Force IR team uses IBM Security QRadar SOAR to enhance itsincident response capabilities.Learn more about 
IBMs incident 
response servicesExtended detection and response provides
a significant advantage over attackers
Detection and response technologiesparticularly when several differentsolutions are combined into an extended detection and response (XDR) solutionprovide organizations with a significant advantage in identifying and eradicatingattackers from a network before they are able to reach the final stage of theirattack, such as ransomware deployment or data theft.In multiple instances, when the X\-Force IR team has deployed an endpointdetection and response (EDR) or XDR solution on a clients network, IR hasimmediately gained additional insight that has assisted in identifying attackeractivities and quickly addressed them. XDR technologies are probably helping todrive the increase in server access and other attack types X\-Force observes thatindicate an attacker was identified and stopped before the operation could achieveits intended conclusion.Learn more about

QRadar XDR54IBM SecurityRisk mitigation recommendationsRecommendations
The following recommendations include specific actions organizations can take to bettersecure their networks against the threats presented in this report.Develop a response plan for ransomware. Every industry and every geography is at risk of 
a ransomware attack, and how your team responds in the critical moment can make all thedifference in the amount of time and money lost in a response.Include in your response plan immediate containment actions, what stakeholders andlaw enforcement officials should be informed, how your organization will safely storeand restore from backups, and an alternate location from where critical business functionscan be run during remediation.Include in your plan a scenario of data theft and leak as part of the ransomware attackthis is a very common tactic used today, seen in a very high percentage of ransomwareattacks X\-Force remediates.Use ransomware drills to also think through whether your organization would pay a ransomand what factors would alter your calculus for that decision.Ensure your ransomware response plan includes a specific contingency for a cloud\-relatedincident, as it may require additional tools and skills.Avoid data corruption due to malware or ransomware attacks with flash storage solutionsthat help prevent data loss, promote operational continuity, and lower infrastructure costs.X\-Forces Definitive Guide to Ransomware gives additional detailed advice on how torespond to a ransomware attack. X\-Forces incident response team can also conducta ransomware readiness assessment for your organization to help build and test aransomware incident response plan. The X\-Force Command Center similarly preparesorganizations for a ransomware attack, taking into account both the business andtechnical response required.Implement multifactor authentication on every remote access point into a network. 
X\-Force has observed more organizations implementing MFA more successfully than everbefore. This is literally altering the threat landscape, forcing threat actors to find new waysof compromising networks rather than leveraging stolen credentials, and decreasing theeffectiveness of email takeover campaigns.MFA can decrease the risk of several different attack types, including ransomware, datatheft, BEC, and server access.In addition, identity and access management technologies are making MFAimplementation easier every yearboth for implementation teams and for end\-users.55IBM SecurityRisk mitigation recommendationsAdopt a layered approach to combat phishing. Unfortunately, there is no one tool or 
solution that will prevent all phishing attacks today, and threat actors continue to refinesocial engineering and anti\-malware detection techniques to circumvent establishedcontrols. Thus, we recommend implementing several layers of solutions that havea higher chance of catching phishing emails.First, effective user awareness and education is key and should includereal\-world examples.Second, employ an email software security solution to put a machine to thetask of identifying and filtering out malicious messages.Third, implement several defenses that can help to catch malware orlateral movement quickly should a phishing email slip through, includingbehavioral\-based anti\-malware detection, endpoint detection and response (EDR),intrusion detection and prevention solutions (IDPS), and a security information andevent management (SIEM) system.Refine and mature your vulnerability management system. Vulnerability management 
is an artfrom identifying which vulnerabilities are most applicable to your organizationsnetwork architecture, to identifying how to deploy them without breaking anything inthe process.Having a team dedicated to vulnerability management and making sure this teamis well\-resourced and supported can make all the difference in ensuring your networkis protected from potential vulnerability exploitation.We recommend prioritizing any of the vulnerabilities mentioned in this assessmentthat are applicable to your organization.IBMs X\-Force Exchange also includes a repository of vulnerabilities and associatedcriticality levels to assist you in identifying vulnerabilities of most concern, andX\-Force Red can provide specialized vulnerability scanning and management services.56IBM SecurityRisk mitigation recommendations
