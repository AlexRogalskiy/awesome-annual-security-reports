Overview
To produce the annual Application Vulnerability Snapshot report, Synopsys Cybersecurity Research 
Center (CyRC) researchers examine anonymized data from commercial software systems and 
applications tested by Synopsys Application Security Testing (AST) services. This years report 
includes data from 4,398 tests conducted in 2021 on 2,711 targets (i.e software or systems). 
Almost all the tests (95%) were intrusive black box and gray box tests, including penetration (pen) 
tests, dynamic application security testing (DAST), and mobile application security testing (MAST) 
analyses.
Black box testing approaches the targets security state from an outsiders perspective, whereas gray 
box testing simulates an authenticated user with credentialsessentially extending black box testing 
with deeper insights. The Synopsys AST services tests probe running applications as a real\-world 
attacker would, with the goal of identifying vulnerabilities that could then be triaged and remediated 
as necessary.
The targets tested were largely web (82%) and mobile (13%) applications, with the remaining 5% 
either source code or network systemsapplications tests. The industries represented included 
software and internet (32%), financial services (26%), business services (18%), manufacturing (7%), 
consumer services (7%), and healthcare (6%). The remaining 4% of test targets represented travel 
and leisure, education, energy and utilities, and other verticals.

Who Should Read This Report
If youre in charge of a software security program, getting a deeper view into software risk can help 
you plan strategic improvements in your security efforts. If youre looking at a security program from 
the tactical side, you can use the information in this report to present a business case for expanding 
security testing in your software security initiative, for example, by enhancing static application 
security testing (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA), or by testing running applications 
with DAST, pen or fuzz testing, or MAST.
According to the Forrester report, The State of Application Security: 2022, web application 
exploits are the third\-most\-common attack (see Figure 1\). With that much exposure, its clear that 
organizations need to test their running web applications in the same way that attackers will, and 
then identify and eliminate vulnerabilities before they are exploited by outside agents.

Who Uses Third\-Party Application Security Testing
Businesses use third\-party application security testing services for a variety of reasons, one of the 
largest being a lack of trained or experienced security professionals. 
Some organizations may also want to validate their own testing and ensure that their internal 
security controls are working. Others may need to extend their software security testing 
capabilities but dont want to add dedicated tools and staff to their budgets. Still others may need 
to comply with regulatory or business requirements that mandate third\-party assessments. For 
example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires pen testing on a 
regular schedule or after any significant changes to the software or system.
The 2022 BSIMM13 Trends and Insights report found that 88% of the organizations participating 
in the Building Software in Maturity Model (BSIMM) project, a program examining the strategies 
organizations employ to build security into software development, use external penetration 
testers to find problems. These tests can uncover issues that might have been missed by internal 
testing and may highlight a weak link in an organizations security toolset. If a static analysis tool 
is failing to capture security defects that surface during DAST or penetration testing, for example, 
there may be a problem in the organizations overall security testing portfolio. 
For those wanting to learn more about the BSIMM project, the BSIMM13 Foundations report 
provides in\-depth detail on BSIMM background and data, and the BSIMM13 Trends and Insights 
report offers a distillation of current BSIMM findings. 
Types of Tests Mentioned in This Report
Sixty\-four percent of the tests conducted in 2021 by Synopsys AST services were pen tests
simulated attacks designed to evaluate the security of an application or system. Pen testing 
enables organizations to find and fix runtime vulnerabilities in the final development stages 
of software or after deployment. Pen tests are often a compliance requirement of security 
standards. As noted earlier in this report, compliance with PCI DSS requires pen testing on a 
regular schedule.
Pen testing also introduces a needed human element into the security equation. Some 
vulnerabilities cant be easily detected by automated testing toolsthey need human oversight to 
be uncovered. For example, the only effective way to detect an insecure direct object reference 
(IDOR), an issue that allows attackers to gain access to unauthorized data, is by performing a 
manual test. 
Third parties can provide expertise, scale, trust 
in findings, and remediation guidance. They can 
also lower your overall risk posture while saving 
you time and money in the long run. Third\-party 
testing is useful when you need to

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) and mobile application security testing (MAST) were 
18% and 12% of the total tests respectively. MAST is used to uncover authentication and authorization 
issues, client\-side trust issues, misconfigured security controls, cross\-platform development framework 
issues, and vulnerabilities in application binaries running on mobile devices and corresponding server\-
side systems.
The primary objective of DAST is to test running web applications for vulnerabilities such as SQL 
injection and cross\-site scripting. The vulnerabilities that are exploited in web applications dont exist in 
source code; they arise only after deployed into production. This makes DAST an essential component 
of any application security testing program. 
As noted earlier, human oversight is sometimes needed to develop a full software security picture. 
Synopsys DAST evaluations include manual testing to uncover vulnerabilities that typically cant be 
found by out\-of\-the\-box tools, such as some vulnerabilities pertaining to authentication and session 
management, access control, and information leakage.
There is often confusion regarding the use of static application security testing (SAST) and software 
composition analysis (SCA) versus the need for DAST and pen testing. SAST and SCA test the 
application code and are used to discover a different set of vulnerabilities than DAST and pen testing. 
Organizations need to utilize multiple testing techniques at various points in the software development 
process for comprehensive security coverage.
Security Issues Found in the Synopsys AST Services Tests
Of the 4,398 tests Synopsys AST services conducted in 2021, 95% uncovered some form of vulnerability 
in the target applications. Twenty\-five percent of the total were high\- or critical\-risk vulnerabilities. 
With more attackers using automated exploitation tools that can attack thousands of systems in a 
matter of seconds, fixing high\- and critical\-risk vulnerabilities is urgent whenever those vulnerabilities 
are discovered. For example, vulnerabilities allowing cross\-site scripting (XSS) can give attackers the 
entry they need to access application resources and data. Synopsys AST services found that 22% of the 
2021 test targets had exposure to reflected, stored, or DOM\-based cross\-site scripting vulnerabilities 
(see Figure 2\).
Critical\-risk vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute code on a web application or application server 
and access sensitive data. Common critical\-risk vulnerabilities include remote code execution and SQL 
injectioninsertion of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. While not shown 
in Figure 2, 4% of the total test targets were vulnerable to some type of SQL injection.

Vulnerabilities Breakdown by the OWASP Top 10
The Open Web Application Security Project (better known as OWASP) Top 10 list represents a 
consensus among a large group of developers and web application security teams of the most 
critical security risks to web applications. In late 2021, the Top 10 list was updated with three new 
categories added and others consolidated or with name and scope changes.
While intended by OWASP as an awareness document, many organizations use the list as a de facto 
application security standard. Of the total 30,731 vulnerabilities discovered in the Synopsys AST 
services tests, 78% fell into an OWASP Top 10 category.

involvement in testing for comprehensive security. 
As a general rule, only manual testing can uncover 
most IDOR issues.
A07:2021Identification and 
Authentication Failures
Previously known as Broken Authentication, the 
A07:2021Identification and Authentication 
Failures category now includes vulnerabilities 
related to identification failures.
Sixteen percent of the total vulnerabilities found 
in the tests belonged to this OWASP category, 
including what is identified in the tests as 
fingerprinting, a security measure sometimes 
used to authenticate users. However, unless web 
servers are properly configured and monitored, 
fingerprinting can also provide attackers with 
valuable information such as OS type, OS version, 
SNMP information, domain names, network 
blocks, VPN points, and more. Insufficient session 
expiration, another member of this category, 
occurs when an application permits the reuse 
of old session credentials or session IDs for 
authorization. 
A03:2021Injection (Client\-Side Attacks: 
Content Spoofing)
The A03:2021Injection category includes well\-
known vulnerabilities such as cross\-site scripting 
and SQL injection. Content spoofing, an attack 
closely related to cross\-site scripting, modifies a 
web page for malicious reasons. Four percent of 
the total vulnerabilities found in the tests fell into 
this category.
A05:2021Security Misconfiguration 
(Application Misconfiguration)
The flip side of server misconfigurations, 
application misconfigurations are also members of 
the A05:2021Security Misconfiguration category. 
Four percent of the total vulnerabilities were related 
to application misconfigurations.
M3: Insufficient Transport Layer 
Protection
Many mobile applications have specific issues 
with insufficient transport layer security, to the 
point where OWASP has dedicated a category 
in the OWASP Mobile Top 10 to it. As OWASP 
notes, mobile applications frequently do not 
protect network traffic. They may use SSLTLS 
during authentication but not elsewhere. This 
inconsistency leads to the risk of exposing data 
and session IDs to interception. Eleven percent 
of vulnerabilities found in the tests were related to 
insufficient transport layer protection.
M6: Insecure Authorization
Seven percent of the test targets contained 
insecure authorization vulnerabilities, another 
OWASP Mobile Top 10 category. Authentication is 
the act of identifying an individual. Authorization 
is the act of checking that the individual has only 
needed permissions. A mobile app transmitting a 
users roles or permissions to a back\-end system 
as part of a request is an example of insecure 
authorization.
OWASP notes that the presence of IDOR 
vulnerabilities is often indicative of code not 
performing a valid authorization check. Again, 
this is an example of the need to have human 
OWASP Categories in Detail
A01:2021Broken Access Control
Eighteen percent of the total vulnerabilities 
were related to the OWASP A01:2021Broken 
Access Control category. The OWASP team notes 
more occurrences of vulnerabilities that fit into 
this category than any other category. Notable 
vulnerabilities in this category include exposure 
of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor, 
exposure of sensitive information through sent 
data, and cross\-site request forgery.
Many of the vulnerabilities contained in the Broken 
Access Control category are more failures in 
business logic than actual vulnerability types, 
and they cannot be easily detected by automated 
testing tools. For example, IDOR issues, which 
allow attackers to manipulate references in order 
to gain access to unauthorized data, are included in 
the Broken Access Control category. As mentioned 
earlier in this report, the only effective way to 
detect IDOR issues is by having a human perform a 
manual test.
A05:2021Security Misconfiguration 
(Server Misconfiguration)
Server misconfigurations, part of the OWASP 
A05:2021Security Misconfiguration category, 
represented 18% of the vulnerabilities found in 
the tests. Security misconfigurations can happen 
at any level of an application stack, including the 
network services, platform, web server, application 
server, database, frameworks, custom code, 
and preinstalled virtual machines, containers, 
or storage. Such flaws frequently give attackers 
unauthorized access to some system data or 
functionality, occasionally even resulting in a 
complete system compromise.

Figure 4\. Top 15 vulnerabilities found by pen and DAST scans (excluding retests)
Figure 4 makes it clear that 
applications often fail in their 
duty to protect the integrity of 
sensitive network traffic. Weak 
SSLTLS configurations were 
the top vulnerability found in the 
overall tests, with 82% of the test 
targets containing some form of 
that vulnerability. Broken down by 
types of tests, pen testing found 
that 77% of its targets had weak 
SSLTLS configurations, with 81% 
found by DAST scans and 32% 
found by MAST scans.
Both the pen tests and DAST 
scans found 22% of the total test 
targets had some exposure to 
cross\-site scripting attacks, one of 
the most prevalent and destructive 
high\- and critical\-risk vulnerabilities 
impacting web applications.

WhiteHat Dynamic
In June 2022, Synopsys acquired WhiteHat Security, an application security pioneer and market\-segment\-leading provider of dynamic application 
security testing solutions. WhiteHat Dynamic expands the Synopsys portfolio of application security testing services that deliver subscription\-
based static analysis, dynamic analysis, and mobile testing services.
During 2021, WhiteHat was used to scan over 16,000 applications and conducted over 5 million scans that uncovered a quarter\-million flaws and 
vulnerabilities in customer web applications. Its interesting to see that the WhiteHat findings closely correspond to those conducted by Synopsys 
AST services and with the OWASP Top 10\.

Even Lower\-Risk Vulnerabilities Can Be Exploited to Facilitate 
Attacks
Many of the vulnerabilities the tests uncovered are considered minimal, low, or medium risk. That is, 
the issues found are not directly exploitable by attackers to gain access to systems or sensitive data. 
Nonetheless, surfacing these vulnerabilities is not an empty exercise, as even lower\-risk vulnerabilities 
can be exploited to facilitate attacks. For example, verbose server bannersfound in 49% of the DAST 
scans and 42% of the pen testsprovide information such as server name, type, and version number 
that could allow attackers to perform targeted attacks on specific technology stacks.
Its clear when looking 
at the results from the 
Synopsys AST services 
tests that the best 
approach to security 
testing is using a 
spectrum of tools to help 
ensure an application or 
system is secure.
 synopsys.com\|12
Implementing or securing protections such as a content security policy (CSP) can provide an 
added layer of security that helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including cross\-
site scripting and data injection attacks. An insecure or absent CSP might be considered a low\-
risk concern. However, the prevalence of cross\-site scripting, clickjacking, and cross\-site leak 
exploits makes a strong argument for having a CSPand more importantly, a secure CSPas 
an effective second layer of protection against various types of attacks, especially cross\-site 
scripting.
The Danger of Vulnerable Third\-Party Libraries
As shown in Figure 4, the pen tests and DAST scans, although run on different applications, 
found many of the same types of vulnerabilities. On the other hand, both types of testing 
revealed vulnerabilities either not found or found far less frequently than the other test. For 
example, the Vulnerable Third\-Party Libraries in Use category was found in 21% of the pen tests 
but it doesnt appear in the top 15 vulnerabilities found in the DAST scans. Although not detailed 
in this report, the same vulnerability category was found in 27% of the static analysis tests 
Synopsys AST services conducted in 2021\.
The Vulnerable Third\-Party Libraries in Use category correlates with OWASP Top 10 category 
A06:2021Vulnerable and Outdated Components. OWASP notes that software is likely 
vulnerable if
You do not know the versions of all components you use (both client\-side and server\-side). 
This includes components you directly use as well as nested dependencies.
The code being used is unsupported or out\-of\-date. This includes the OS, webapplication 
server, database management system, applications, APIs, and all components, runtime 
environments, and libraries.
In light of high\-profile supply chain attacks, software supply chain security has become a 
major concern for organizations dependent on third\-party software. Most programs managing 
software supply chain risk focus on identifying and securing third\-party softwareoften open 
source softwarethat is destined for integration into software developed in\-house. A recent 
report from Synopsys and the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) found that 73% of survey 
respondents have increased their efforts to secure their organizations software supply chain 
through a variety of initiatives.
Software supply chain 
security has become 
a major concern for 
organizations dependent 
on third\-party software.
 synopsys.com\|13
Managing Supply Chain Risk with a Software Bill of Materials
To better manage supply chain risk, more organizations are using automated tools to generate a 
software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to fully identify the third\-party software they use and improve 
their ability to respond to disclosed vulnerabilities. Evidence of the movement toward SBOMs can 
be seen in the 30% growth of the create Bills of Materials for software BSIMM activity recorded 
in the BSIMM13 Foundations report. BSIMM13 data also indicates a 35% increase in both the 
identify open source and control open source risk activities due to the prevalence of open source 
components in modern software and the rise of attacks using vulnerable open projects as vectors.
With many companies having hundreds of applications or software systems in use, each themselves 
likely dependent on hundreds to thousands of different third\-party and open source components, an 
accurate, up\-to\-date SBOM is urgently needed to effectively track those components.
The Need for a Holistic AppSec Program to Manage Risk 
at Scale
Businesses that sell software, or products that include embedded software, cant afford security, 
compliance, or quality issues compromising those products. Even businesses not directly engaged in 
selling software or software\-driven products depend on software quality and security. Software drives 
the administrative systems for most payroll, billing, receivables, sales\-tracking, and customer records. 
Software controls production, manages inventories, directs warehousing, and runs the distribution 
systems that keep business running.
Software is also the way most businesses interact with customers. As noted earlier, the Forrester 
report, The State of Application Security, 2022, states that web application exploits are the third\-
most\-common type of software attack. The giant credit risk assessment firm Equifax fell prey to such 
an exploit when an attackers breach of the underlying software framework of an Equifax web portal 
exposed the personal data of 143 million U.S. citizens.
Its obvious that organizations not only should test web applications for common flaws, vulnerabilities, 
and misconfigurations with static analysis and software composition analysis tools, but also test their 
running web applications in the same way that attackers probe them.
A full spectrum of application security testing is an essential component of managing software risk in 
todays world. When an organization lacks the needed human resources or tools to perform high\-level 
black and gray box security testing or needs to validate its own security controls, working with a third 
party such as Synopsys Application Security Testing services may be the ideal solution.
