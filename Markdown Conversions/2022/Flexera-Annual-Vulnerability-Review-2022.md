Flexera Secunia Research Team who produces valuable advisories leveraged by users of Flexeras 
Software Vulnerability Research and Software Vulnerability Manager solutions.The report analyzes the evolution of software security from a vulnerability, threat intelligence and 
patch perspective.The report presents global data on the prevalence of vulnerabilities, exploits, the availability of 
patches and maps the security threats to IT infrastructures.What does the report cover?The annual Vulnerability Review is based on data from Flexera's Secunia Research. Secunia Research 
monitors more than 66,000 applications, appliances and operating systems, and tests and verifies 
the vulnerabilities reported in them.The systems and applications monitored by Secunia Research are in use in the environments of the 
customers of Flexera Software Vulnerability Management solutions.The vulnerability database covers vulnerabilities that can be exploited in all types of products, 
including software, hardware and firmware.The vulnerabilities verified by Secunia Research are described in Secunia Advisories and listed in
the Flexera Vulnerability Database, detailing what IT security teams need to know to mitigate the 
vulnerability risk posed in their environments. The Secunia Advisory descriptions include criticality, 
attack vector, exploitability and solution status.How do we count vulnerabilities?Research houses in the vulnerability management space adopt different approaches to counting 
vulnerabilities.Secunia Research counts vulnerabilities per product in which the vulnerability appears. We apply this 
method to reflect the level of information our customers need to keep their environments secure.We provide verified intelligence listing all products affected by a given vulnerability.2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential5Secunia Research Software Vulnerability tracking processA vulnerability is an error in software which can be exploited with a security impact and gain. 
Secunia Research validates, verifies and tests vulnerability information to author security advisories 
which provide valuable details by following consistent and standard processes that have been 
refined over the years.Whenever a new vulnerability is reported, its verified and a Secunia Advisory is published. A Secunia 
Advisory provides details, including description of the vulnerability, risk rating, impact, attack vector, 
recommended mitigation, credits, references and more, including additional details discovered 
during verification and testing, thus providing the information required to make appropriate 
decisions about how to protect systems.Click here to learn more about Secunia Advisories and their contents.2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential62022 summaryTotal advisories: 7,097 (2021 : 6,153\)2022 was a busy year for cybersecurity, a record\-breaking number of advisories were reported, and 
many significant vulnerabilities were the cause of data breaches, ransomware attacks and other 
types of threats.Top 3 most critical vulnerabilities:1\.Log4ShellLog4j (CVE\-2021\-44228\), even with its disclosure in December 2021, manyorganizations are still struggling to identify and patch the vulnerability.2\.Spring4Shell (CVE\-2022\-22965\), still many systems remain unpatched despite the risk.3\.ProxyNotShell (CVE\-2022\-41040 and CVE\-2022\-41082\) in ExchangeInteresting facts and trends:2022 is the year with the most recorded Secunia Advisories since 2002Average threat score of 2022: 13\.66 (click here to learn how we calculate this)Average CVSS3 score of 2022: 7\.35Fewer extreme critical advisories have been reported in 2022: 44 (2021: 60\)85 advisories reported a zero\-day vulnerability (2021: 81\)More than 50 percent of all advisories are for vulnerabilities in UnixLinux operating systemsMore than 50 percent of all rejected advisories are also for UnixLinux operating systemsAlmost 79 percent of all networking\-related advisories are for Cisco, NetApp and JuniperAbout Microsoft:Four percent of all advisories were for Microsoft, which put them in eighth placein vendor rankingMore than 56 percent of all zero\-days were related to Microsoft products (first place).None of the top four vendors with the most advisories (SUSE, IBM, Red Hat, Ubuntu) had anyzero\-day reported in 20222023 Flexera\|Company Confidential7Log4j:131 advisories were related to Log4jLast advisory was released in November (eleven months later) for IBM Security QRadar 
SIEM 7\.x 
62 Log4j related advisories were linked to IBM products 
33 of them were rejected advisories for various reasons, including the respective product 
does not have the vulnerable log4j componentLess than 11 percent of all advisories had a high to critical threat score which means that there 
was evidence of exploitationUsing threat intelligence will help you prioritize what needs immediate patchingSoftware Vulnerability and Patch Management are becoming increasingly important. Due to the 
ongoing Russia\-Ukraine conflict, attacks on critical infrastructures in many countries are increasing. 
Back in 2019 (just before COVID\-19\), patching was recommended within 30 days (or 14 days for CVSS 
score of seven or higher). Right now, hackers can deploy exploits within one week and even within 
24 hours. This means organizations need even better prioritization to quickly patch vulnerabilities 
(especially those with associated threats).2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential8Advisories breakdownCompared to previous years2022 total advisory count: 7,097 (2021 : 6,153\)As expected, 2022 had the highest number of advisories since Secunia started writing these.Figure 1: Top ten years with most advisoriesFigure 2: Chart with advisory trendline over 
the yearsThis year:\#Change (last year)Total \# of advisories7,097 (6,153\)Unique vendorsUnique versionsRejected advisories \*2791,8011,108 (263\) (1,784\) (1,042\) increased lower same\*1,108 advisories have received the rejected status which means in general that the vulnerability requires one or more 
violations of security best practices (e.g product not securely configured or not used securely) or that it was too weak
of a gain (e.g administrative, local users already being too privileged so that additional gain becomes neglectable).2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential9Advisory criticality and attack vectorMore information about the variables used in the above charts:Attack vector (from where)Criticality (severity)Though not in the chart, Secunia Research also provides information about the impact or 
consequence when a vulnerability has been exploited. There are twelve values that can
be used (most advisories have one or more). Read more here.2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential10Advisories and rejected advisoriesRejected advisoriesThere are a lot of vulnerabilities posted to the National Vulnerability Database, by a lot of people 
and companies. Theyre not always valid, theyre not always assigned proper criticality, and in some 
cases, a vulnerability may be legitimate but not provide the attacker any benefit.The Flexera Secunia Research team evaluates vulnerabilities from hundreds of sources, rescores 
them when necessary and even rejects vulnerabilities not worth your attention. Rejection advisories 
help you reduce the volume of vulnerabilities to be mitigated by helping you focus only on those 
that present reasonable risk to your environment.2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential11An advisory may be rejected for many reasons; the most common are:No reachabilityThe vulnerability cannot be exploited because the affected systems cannot be reached
by an attacker.No gainThe vulnerability may be reached, but without any gain for the attacker.No exploitabilityThe vulnerability cannot be exploited because, for example, policy forbids installation
of the affected software.Dependent on otherThe vulnerability cannot be exploited by itself but depends on another vulnerability
being present.2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential12Addressing awareness with vulnerability insightsPrevelance:How many systems would benefit from any given security update?Does it pose a risk? Is it on all systems? PatchAsset sensitivity:What systems would result in the most risk if compromised?Is it a high\-risk device? PatchCriticality:The most popular method of thoughtful prioritization.If exploited, how bad could it affect your security?
Is it designated to be of a high criticality? Patch Threat intelligence:The newest and most impactful method focuseson the likelihood of exploitation.Is it likely to be exploited? Patch2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential13How do we know that more insightsdata is needed?Focusing on advisories with CVSS 7 or higher would address about 50 percent of exploits. Most exploits are 
CVSS scored between four and seven. Focusing on vulnerabilities for the top 20 vendors would address only 
about 20 percent.Take away 1:High and extreme critical advisories are not necessarily those presenting the most risk. Leverage 
threat intelligence to better prioritize what demands your most urgent attention. Create a scoring 
mechanism that considers multiple variables.More about Secunia Criticality (severity) scoringTake away 2:Most vulnerabilities have a patch available (typically within 24 hours after disclosure).2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential14Vendor viewTop vendors with most advisories2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential15Top vendors with highest average threat score2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential16Top vendors with zero\-days2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential17Top ten products with the most zero\-days reported in 2022Place\# of Zero\-daysProduct family1234567891038Microsoft Windows997522211Google ChromeMicrosoft Edge (Chromium\-Based)Apple macOSApple iOSApple SafariMozilla FirefoxFortinet FortiOSApex CentralAtlassian Confluence2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential18Browser\-related advisoriesAdvisories per browserBrowser zero\-day vulnerabilities2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential19Average CVSS (criticality) score per browserAverage threat score per browser2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential20Networking\-related advisoriesNumber of advisories per networking\-related vendorAverage threat and CVSS score per networking\-related vendor2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential21Threat intelligenceA look at threat intelligence\-related dataCount of malware\-exploited CVEsCount of advisories by CVE threat scoreThreat intelligence advisory statistics:2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential22PatchingMost of 2022s vulnerabilities were vendor patched. In fact, most vulnerabilities are patched within 
24 hours after disclosure.The challenge remains that organizations dont have full visibility or awareness when a vulnerability 
is disclosed (time to awareness). Another big challenge is time to remediation (the time from having 
this information, correlating that with your environment and initiating the process to get the 
software updated to a secure version).Vulnerabilities that are vendor patched2023 Flexera\|Company Confidential23SVM patch statisticsFlexera has the largest third\-party patch catalog in the world. This helps you act quicker and save 
time by offering an integrated approach to effectively locate, prioritize and quickly remediate
